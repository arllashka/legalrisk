ASA Ruling on Aspro Atlantic Medikal Turizm Ticaret Limited Şirketi t/a AsproMED,"In June 2023 the United Nations confirmed that, following a request from their government, that the Republic of Turkey would henceforth be identified as the Republic of Türkiye. Although the change has been implemented, we have used the former here because it is currently more commonly understood by consumers. This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on cosmetic surgery abroad. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Summary of Council decision: Four issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad for AsproMED, promoting cosmetic surgery in Turkey, seen in May 2023. The caption stated “[megaphone emoji] Are you ready to unleash your inner beauty, dear friend? [star emoji] [briefcase emoji]”, “Look no further than AsproMED, your trusted partner in the realm of medical tourism! [earth emoji] [airplane emoji]”, and “Let us guide you towards the path of radiant transformation! [sparkles emoji] [massage emoji]”. The ad included a photo of a slim woman holding a balloon while she pointed to her stomach, together with a smaller illustration of a gastric balloon in a stomach. Text next to the image stated “BARIATRIC TREATMENT -Gastric Balloon -Gastric Bypass -Gastric Sleeve -Liposuction -Lifting” and “Get a permanent beauty with Gastric Balloon”. Text underneath stated “4, 5 Stars Hotel + Travel to Istanbul + Professional Team”. Another image featured the Hagia Sophia skyline with several boats in front of it.","The ASA challenged whether the: 1. references to “inner beauty” and “permanent beauty” were irresponsible because they exploited insecurities around body image; 2. ad, which encouraged consumers to travel abroad for cosmetic surgery, was irresponsible because it trivialised the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery; 3. claim “permanent beauty” was misleading regarding the effects of bariatric surgery; and 4. ad misleadingly omitted information regarding the need for a pre-consultation to assess the patient’s potential contraindications and suitability for the procedures, including where such pre-consultation would take place.","1., 2., 3. & 4. AsproMED did not response to the ASA’s enquiries. Meta had no comments in relation to the ASA’s investigation.","Upheld The ASA was concerned by AsproMED’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. 1. Upheld The ad featured the claims “Are you ready to unleash your inner beauty, dear friend?” and “Get a permanent beauty with Gastric Balloon” together with a photo of a slim woman pointing to her flat stomach. We considered that the references to “inner beauty” and “permanent beauty” together with the image implied that having a body that did not conform to prevailing beauty standards of slimness was a source of concern that could be rectified by surgery. We considered the ad exploited people’s insecurities and perpetuated pressure for them to conform to body image stereotypes. We therefore concluded that it was socially irresponsible. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Responsible advertising). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required marketing communications to be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The ad included references to “4, 5 Stars Hotel”, “Travel to Istanbul” and “medical tourism”, combined with imagery of boats sailing across the Hagia Sophia skyline (a well-known tourist attraction) and various emojis. We considered that the ad was not likely to be interpreted as promoting a holiday; rather, its purpose was clear that it was for cosmetic surgery abroad. However, because the overall tone of the ad, including the wording and visuals, focused on the travel, it was likely to detract from the seriousness of the surgery offered. It was also relevant that the surgery would take place abroad which raised the potential for additional risks, such as: whether the doctors and treatment providers would have the same standards of care and safety as in the UK; and how any arrangements for follow-up care and dealing with any complications which arose would be managed. We considered that the ad could be interpreted as suggesting that surgery was a decision that could be undertaken lightly as part of a holiday, without serious consideration of the nature of the intervention. We therefore concluded that the overall presentation of the ad was likely to be seen as trivialising cosmetic surgery. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility). 3. Upheld The ad included the claim “Get a permanent beauty with Gastric Balloon”. We considered that consumers would understand the claim to mean that undergoing a gastroscopy, without any other changes, would lead to permanent weight loss. We understood, however, that NHS Guidance on weight loss surgeries stated that an intra-gastric balloon was only a temporary measure and usually only left in for a maximum of 6 months. It further stated that all bariatric surgeries required commitment to permanent lifestyle changes to prevent weight gain, including following a diet plan, exercise and regular follow-up appointments. We therefore concluded that the claim “Get a permanent beauty with Gastric Balloon” was misleading. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading advertising). 4. Upheld The CAP Guidance on Cosmetic interventions stated that marketers should not imply that invasive surgery was a “minor procedure” or similar if that claim was likely to mislead as to the complexity or duration of the operation, the pain experienced either during or after the operation, the length of the recovery time or the potential side-effects. Ads should not mislead as to the likely commitment required for pre-consultation, surgery, recovery and post-operative assessments. Aside from referencing that the surgery would take place in Istanbul, Turkey, the ad contained no further details about the various procedures advertised. The ad omitted information regarding the need for a pre-consultation to assess the patient’s potential contraindications and suitability for the two procedures advertised, including where such a pre-consultation would take place. We considered that a pre-consultation would be necessary in order to also discuss the patient’s concerns and suitability for the procedures, outline the complexity or duration of the operations, the pain during or after the operation, the length of recovery time and the potential risks and side effects. We understood it was likely that those pre-consultations might sometimes need to take place in person rather than remotely. We considered that in the context of an ad for cosmetic surgery abroad, information regarding the necessity for pre-consultations and where those would take place was material information necessary for consumers to make a considered decision and should have been included in the ad. Because that material information was not included we considered that the ad was misleading. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 and rule 3.3 (Misleading advertising).",The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Aspro Atlantic Medikal Turizm Ticaret Ltd ?irketi t/a AsproMED to ensure that their ads were socially responsible and did not exploit insecurities around body image or trivialise the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery. We also told them not to mislead consumers by claiming that bariatric surgeries can achieve permanent results without other lifestyle changes or omitting material information regarding cosmetic surgery procedures abroad and the need for a pre-consultation (including where it would take place). We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/aspro-atlantic-medikal-turizm-ticaret-limited-irketi.html
ASA Ruling on We Love Holidays Ltd t/a LoveHolidays,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Two holiday listings seen on the website for loveholidays, www.loveholidays.com: a. The first listing, seen on 20 March 2025, featured details for a hotel and return flights to New York. Text stated “£1,090pp [crossed out] £749pp”. b. The second listing, seen on 24 March 2025, featured details for a hotel and return flights to Tenerife. Text stated “£1,119pp [crossed out] £699pp”.",,"1. & 2. We Love Holidays Ltd t/a loveholidays stated that their website received a very large number of daily visits and regretted the small number of occasions when search results appeared out-of-date. They stated that the vast majority of their prices did not change and were available to book at the price quoted. Their website searched over 42,000 hotels and 99% of all UK flights, resulting in billions of possible holiday combinations. Flight data on their website was updated continuously throughout the day, and accommodation data was updated three times a day. In that context, they believed they had reasonable systems in place to ensure the prices displayed on their website were as accurate as possible when considering the dynamic nature of the travel industry and their use of third-party suppliers. Loveholidays acknowledged that the stated price in ad (a) was not up-to-date when it was seen. They stated that they were reliant on third-party advertisers for flight and hotel pricing, which could change rapidly. They believed a delay in their system in updating accommodation information may have caused the holiday to have been advertised at the incorrect price. Loveholidays also acknowledged that the complainant had experienced a price increase when attempting to book the holiday seen in ad (b). They stated that was because their pricing was dynamic and subject to change based on third-party suppliers. The lower price continued to be displayed after the complainant had made their booking due to a delay in their website’s system updating the supplier’s new pricing. Loveholidays stated that they were taking steps to prevent similar issues from occurring in future. That included improving the speed and accuracy of price updates on their website, working with third-party suppliers to reduce the time it took for loveholidays to be notified of price changes, and reviewing their advertising practices to ensure that pricing information was presented clearly and accurately.","The ads were holiday listings on the loveholidays website and included details such as the hotel, travel dates, and board basis. The price in ad (a) was advertised as “£749pp [per person]” and the price in ad (b) was advertised as “£699pp [per person]”. The ASA considered that, in the absence of any qualifications, consumers would understand the price claims in both ads to mean those prices were available at the time they viewed the ad, and that amount was the price they would pay per person to book that holiday. This impression was reinforced by the crossed-out reference price featured in each ad, which suggested that the advertised price was a static offer that represented a price saving compared to the normal cost of the holiday. However, we understood that when the complainants attempted to book the respective holidays online, the price of the holidays increased. They were informed this was due to live pricing, which was subject to change. We further understood that despite the price increase, the holidays continued to be advertised on the loveholidays website at the original lower price after the complainants attempted to book them. We acknowledged that travel marketers often dealt with third-party suppliers, and that prices in the travel sector were dynamic and could vary. However, CAP guidance on “Travel marketing: Working with third parties” stated that marketers should take reasonable steps to reduce the likelihood of consumers being misled. For example, marketers should ensure that prices that were subject to change were described as “from” prices and make clear in their advertising the date of the last price update. Because accommodation price data was not updated on the loveholidays website in real time, we expected their marketing communications to make clear when the last price update was, and that the price featured was liable to change. However, that information was not included in the ads. It was also unclear how the reference price and associated savings claims featured in both ads had been calculated, given that the prices on loveholidays’ website were frequently subject to change. We understood that loveholidays believed a delay in their website’s system may have prevented the prices seen in ads (a) and (b) from being updated after a higher price had been quoted to the complainants. Nevertheless, they were responsible for taking reasonable steps to ensure their stated prices were genuine and did not mislead. Because the holidays could not be booked for the prices advertised in ad (a) and ad (b), and those lower prices continued to be advertised after the price had increased, we concluded that the ads were misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (Prices).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told We Love Holidays Ltd t/a loveholidays to ensure that advertised prices were based on genuine prices available to consumers. We also told them to take steps to reduce the likelihood of consumers being misled, for example, by describing prices that were subject to change as “from” prices and stating when those prices were last updated.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/we-love-holidays-ltd-g25-1286542-we-love-holidays-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Tonic Nutrition Ltd t/a Tonic Health,"On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling was received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ads and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code . Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A website review page and an Instagram reel for Tonic Health, seen on 22 October 2024: a. The product review page on the Tonic Health website, www.tonichealth.co, contained testimonials from customers consisting of a star rating, customer name, title and a brief review. b. The Instagram reel, on Tonic Health’s account @tonichealth, entitled “THE BEST SLEEP SUPPLEMENT ON THE MARKET” promoted the “Rest & Recover Effervescent tablet”. It featured a video of a man in the supplements aisle of a supermarket who stated, “Are you struggling with sleep? Well, I’ve got just the thing for you […] Tonic have just launched our Rest & Recover, which is over 300 mg of bioavailable magnesium along with ashwagandha and lemon balm.” Nutritional information for the product appeared on-screen. The caption stated, “Struggling with sleep? I’ve got just the thing to help Introducing Tonic Rest & Recover Our new 4-in1 effervescent designed to support your sleep and recovery With a soothing cherry flavour, each effervescent blends 300mg of essential magnesium, 100mg of KSM-^^ Ashwagandha, and 500mg of calming lemon balm. This powerhouse combination helps ease stress, improve sleep, and support muscle recovery so you can wake up refreshed and ready for the [closing text cut off]”.",,"1. Tonic Nutrition Ltd t/a Tonic Health acknowledged that duplicated testimonials had appeared under different customer names. They said that was due to a technical error which had now been fully rectified. They said they had removed the testimonials in question and were implementing stricter internal processes in order to check all reviews and to ensure that there were no further errors of that type. 2. Tonic Health said they recognised that the claims “THE BEST SLEEP SUPPLEMENT ON THE MARKET” and “Are you struggling with sleep?” required substantiation through the Great Britain Nutrition and Health Claims Register (the GB NHC Register). They had therefore removed those claims from their advertising. Tonic Health said the phrase “Rest & Recover” was widely recognised as shorthand for rest and recuperation and was used colloquially to describe moments of winding down, particularly in the evening. They used the claim in that lifestyle and cultural context; in their view, it did not imply physiological change or health benefits. They believed that the Code did not automatically apply in circumstances where a phrase was clearly part of a product range or sub-brand and was not highlighted as an individual claim. Notwithstanding that, they always accompanied general phrases such as “Rest & Recover with a valid authorised health claim from the GB NHC Register. They said they used the claim “Magnesium contributes to the normal functioning of the nervous system” alongside relevant products.","The CAP Code stated that marketers must hold documentary evidence that a testimonial or endorsement used in a marketing communication was genuine, unless it was obviously fictitious, and hold contact details for the person who, or organisation, that gave it. The complainant reported having seen identical wording for a product review appear twice on the same page, attributed to two different customer names. The ASA considered the duplicated reviews created the misleading impression that more customers had independently submitted similar positive feedback than was actually the case. We understood that when the complainant approached Tonic Health in November 2024, they were told that the duplicated reviews had appeared in error due to a technical issue which had now been rectified. However, we understood that duplicated reviews continued to appear as late as January 2025. We welcomed Tonic Health’s assurances that the affected testimonials had been removed, that the issue had been fully rectified and that all reviews would be checked in future. Some of the reviews were duplicated and attributed to the wrong author. We therefore considered they were not genuine. For that reason we concluded the ads were misleading and had breached the Code. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.45 (Endorsements and Testimonials). The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health, and required that only health claims authorised on the applicable register, which in this case was the GB NHC Register, were permitted in marketing communications for foods. The Code also required that general health claims, which were claims that referred to the general benefits of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health-related well-being, must be accompanied by a specific authorised health claim. We first assessed which claims were specific health claims and which, therefore, must be authorised on the GB NHC Register. Ad (b) stated, “THE BEST SLEEP SUPPLEMENT ON THE MARKET” and “Are you struggling with sleep?”. We considered those were specific health claims because they implied that the supplement, and its listed ingredients – magnesium, ashwagandha and lemon balm – provided the beneficial health effect of aiding the quality of sleep. We further considered that “THE BEST SLEEP SUPPLEMENT ON THE MARKET” was a comparative specific health claim because it implied that the product was the most beneficial to sleep quality. We welcomed Tonic Health’s assurance that they had removed the claims. However, we had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that they were authorised on the GB NHC Register. The ad further stated “[…] each effervescent blends 300mg of essential magnesium, 100mg of KSM-^^ Ashwagandha, and 500mg of calming lemon balm. This powerhouse combination helps ease stress, improve sleep, and support muscle recovery so you can wake up refreshed […]”. We considered that those were specific health claims that the substances named had the beneficial effect of relieving stress, improving sleep quality and supporting muscle recovery. However, we had not seen evidence that those claims were authorised on the GB NHC Register. We then assessed which claims were general health claims, which must be accompanied by an authorised specific health claim on the GB Register. We acknowledged Tonic Health’s comments; however, the Code applied to claims that appeared in product names in the same way that it did to claims appearing elsewhere in ads. We considered the claim “Rest & Recover”, in the context of an ad for a supplement on an account for Tonic Health, would be understood as a reference to the general benefit of the supplement for overall good health and wellbeing. We considered it was therefore a general health claim for the purposes of the Code and would only be acceptable if accompanied by a relevant specific authorised health claim. Because we had not seen any evidence that the specific and comparative health claims in ad (b) were authorised on the GB Register, and because the ad made a general health claim that was not accompanied by a relevant authorised specific health claim, we therefore concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 and 15.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals).","The ads must not appear in the form complained of. We told Tonic Nutrition Ltd t/a Tonic Health to ensure that future testimonials accurately represented customer feedback. We also told them to ensure any specific health claims or comparative specific health claims made in their future advertising were authorised on the GB NHC Register and complied with the conditions of use for those claims. Additionally, any general health claims needed to be accompanied by a relevant authorised specific health claim.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/tonic-nutrition-ltd-a24-1269415-tonic-nutrition-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Trip Drink Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website for TRIP, www.drink-trip.com, a retailer of drinks infused with CBD or Magnesium, seen on 20 in December 2024, included a webpage headed “Cucumber Mint – Mindful Blend Magnesium Drink”. Images of cans appeared on a reel. Next to one image of a can, text stated “0G ADDED SUGAR”. Under the heading “How to use”, the ad stated “Try me in the morning to help find some calm before a long day, or take a TRIP to unwind when work is over”. This was alongside an image of a can accompanied by the text “95% of TRIP customers felt that Mindful BlendTM made them feel calmer”. Under “Ingredients” were listed “[…] fruit juices from concentrate (23%) (grape, apple, cucumber (2%)) [sic], magnesium citrate natural flavourings and botanical extracts (spearmint, lemon balm, chamomile, ginseng), citric acid, flavour enhancer (erythritol), natural sweetener (steviol glycosides), lion’s mane extract, ashwagandha root extract, L-theanine”. Under another heading, “Nutrition”, the ad stated, “[…] carbohydrates 2.9g (of which 2.3g naturally occurring sugars)”. Under a further heading “Studies” text stated, “Efficacy: A statistically significant decrease in the serum cortisol level appeared after (500mg) Mg supplementation, for 28 days. […] Source: http://scindeks.ceon.rs/article.aspx?artid=1452-82581403291Z&lang=en”. Further text stated, “It’s the viral ingredients everyone’s talking about, in one unique blend. Award-winning flavours, with Magnesium, Lion’s Mane, Ashwagandha and L-theanine, every refreshing drop has been crafted for calm”. The ad featured a reel of headlines which included “Magnesium is the latest buzzy supplement. Can it help with anxiety? While this mineral may not work for everyone, here’s what we know about the possible benefits”. Another headline mentioned “Health Benefits of Lion’s Mane - Reduces Anxiety and Stress”. A further headline read “Lion’s mane is all the rage for […] mental health”. Under the title “FAQs” text stated, “What is the Mindful Blend range? A […] drinks range, crafted for Calm […] with science-backed ingredients, helping you relax into your best self. What’s in the Mindful Blend? […] Magnesium, Lion’s Mane, Ashwagandha & L-theanine, at the perfect amounts to deliver a uniquely delicious, authentically functional beverage, helping you unwind into your best self […] Will it make me sleepy […] It will simply help you feel calm. How do the ingredients work […] Each ingredient works with your natural bodies’ [sic] systems in different ways, to promote feelings of calm”.","The complainant, who had professional expertise in chemistry and pharmaceutical science, challenged whether:","1. Trip Drinks Ltd t/a TRIP said that the sugars in their product were naturally occurring from fruit juices from concentrate (grape and apple), which were included for their flavour and functional attributes. They provided an extract on fruit nectars and the use of “no added sugar” in labelling from technical guidance issued by a trade association. They believed their use of the claim in their ad was consistent with that guidance. TRIP also stated that under the relevant legislation a “no added sugar” claim was permitted where the product did not contain any added mono- or disaccharides, or any other food used for its sweetening properties. They said that in accordance with that regulation, the product included the required statement, “Contains naturally occurring sugars”. TRIP explained that their formulation contained both bulk (erythritol) and intense (stevia) sweeteners. They were separately declared on the product’s pack under the text “with sweeteners”. They said that this reinforced the point that the fruit juices were not used for sweetening, but for flavour, colour, texture and mouthfeel. 2. & 3. TRIP said that they had removed the claims that the product reduced serum cortisol levels and promoted feelings of calm, and that the product could help with or reduce anxiety and stress, as a precaution while they awaited external advice. They had begun an internal audit to ensure no references remained in their advertising but hoped to be in a position to make the claims in the future.","The CAP Code required that only nutrition claims authorised on the Great Britain Nutrition and Health Claims Register (the GB Register) were permitted in marketing communications. The Code defined a nutrition claim as any claim which stated, suggested or implied that a food (or drink) had particular beneficial nutritional properties due to the amount of calories, nutrients or other substances it contained, did not contain, or contained in reduced or increased proportions. In addition, the advertiser was required to ensure that the product met the conditions of use associated with the authorised claim. The ASA considered the claim “0g added sugar” to be equivalent to “with no added sugars”, which was a permitted nutrition claim on the GB Register. The conditions of use associated with a “with no added sugars” claim permitted it to be made only where a product did not contain any added mono- or disaccharides, or any other food used for its sweetening properties. If sugars were naturally present in the food, the conditions of use required the following indication to appear on the label: “CONTAINS NATURALLY OCCURRING SUGARS”. While TRIP stated that the grape and apple juices from concentrate were for flavour, colour, texture and mouthfeel, rather than sweetening, there were naturally occurring sugars in the juices which added sugars to the product. We accepted that the ad stated “[…] carbohydrates 2.9g (of which 2.3g naturally occurring sugars)” and understood that the product was labelled as containing naturally occurring sugars. The Department of Health and Social Care’s “Nutrition and health claims: guidance to compliance with Regulation (EC) 1924/2006” stated that, where a “with no added sugars” claim was made, the question of whether any other food in the product was used for its sweetening properties needed to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. It depended on the nature of the product, why ingredients were used and how it was labelled. The guidance pointed to the name of the product as likely to indicate whether the other food was present as a defining ingredient or as a sweetener. The guidance gave the following examples. In a cranberry juice drink, the use of concentrated grape juice was usually to sweeten the product and was not included in the name. Conversely, in a mango and apple juice drink, the presence of apple juice was indicated in the name and was not added to sweeten the product. The guidance also noted that any sweetening effect was likely to be negligible with mango juice which was itself sweet. TRIP’s ad was for a cucumber and mint drink, neither of which were likely to be sweet. The fruit concentrate was from grape and apple, neither of which were in the name of the product. We acknowledged the product contained the sweeteners erythritol and stevia, and that the fruit concentrate would contribute to other aspects of the product such as colour, texture and mouthfeel. However, it would also have a sweetening effect due to the naturally occurring sugars. We therefore considered it was used, at least in part, for its sweetening properties. We therefore considered that the claim “0g added sugar” did not comply with the conditions of use associated with the equivalent “with no added sugars” nutrition claim and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the GB Register were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health. The ad implied the magnesium in the product could reduce serum cortisol levels. The ad also referred to being “crafted for calm”; claimed the product would “simply help you feel calm”; and that “Each ingredient works with your natural bodies’ [sic] systems in different ways, to promote feelings of calm”. We considered those claims were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code, because they implied that the ingredients had beneficial health effects. However, we had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that those claims were authorised on the GB Register and they therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code prohibited claims which stated or implied a food (or drink) could prevent, treat or cure human disease. We considered the claims in the ad relating to the reduction of anxiety, for example “Health Benefits of Lion’s Mane - Reduces Anxiety and Stress” would be understood by consumers as a claim to prevent, treat or cure anxiety. We further considered that in the context of the ad, the claims that the product could help with or reduce stress would also likely be understood by consumers as a reference to anxiety and its symptoms. We also considered in the context of the claims about anxiety and stress, the claim “Lion’s mane is all the rage for […] mental health” would also be understood to relate to the treatment of anxiety. We therefore concluded that the claims that the product could help to reduce stress, and the direct claim to reduce anxiety, were claims that a food could prevent, treat or cure disease which breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Trip Drinks Ltd t/a TRIP to ensure their ads did not make claims that a food or food supplement could prevent, treat or cure human disease. We also told them to ensure any nutrition claims complied with the conditions of use associated with the relevant claim on the GB Register, and that they did not use specific health claims that were not authorised on the GB Register.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/trip-drink-ltd-a25-1277097-trip-drink-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Detox Today,"One point was investigated and resolved informally with the advertiser’s agreement to make changes. The homepage would be amended to not imply Detox Today were the only treatment provider to be insured, have treatment liability and be disclosure certified.","The website homepage, www.detoxtoday.co.uk, for Detox Today, an alcohol addiction help and support service, seen in March 2025. The website included the claims: “Medical & Psychological Addiction Treatments. We offer alcohol addiction recovery services including addiction advice, how to get well, what to do for family members, medical assessments, interventions, home alcohol detox plans, online alcoholism counselling, sober coaching and sobriety maintenance services including abstinence medications”; “Organise Medical Treatments”; “We know that relapse can be part of the recovery journey, and we provide medical support to secondary and tertiary rehab units, and supported accommodation housing”; “Remote alcohol home detox service including addiction assessment, doctor consultation and prescription medications”; “We have a range of medical treatments to support abstinence and recovery including disulfiram, campral & naltrexone”; and “We provide life-saving alcohol detox, alcohol rehab, counselling and sober services in the UK. Our medical and therapeutic teams are here to provide first-class addiction treatment to help individuals, families and organisations”. The Alcohol Detox at Home Treatment page also said. “Once the initial call and assessment is complete, we arrange a client call with our doctor”.","The complainant, a director of a drug and alcohol treatment charity, challenged whether the ad implied that the marketer provided registered medical treatment and therefore was misleading.","Detox Today explained that as the result of contact from a separate organisation, changes had already been made to the website. They explained that Detox Today was staffed by one individual and offered remote private treatments to help people stop drinking. They offered therapy either in the context of home detox or independent of that. Those services did not need to be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered. Regarding the home detox service, they explained there were two main elements. The first would be the need for a doctor to prescribe medication and supervise the detox. They said they would put the client in contact with the doctor (who would be private but have the necessary registration) and any ongoing medical needs would be supervised by the doctor. Detox Today’s role would then be to provide therapy and support alongside the medical treatment. Detox Today said they had no involvement with residential rehabs which had to be CQC registered. They said they were willing to make further changes to the website if necessary.","The CAP Code stated marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so. The ASA noted that the Detox Today website did list the services offered by the advertiser, such as “in-person counselling, therapy, sober coaching & recovery support” and “Home detox for alcohol”. However, it also talked about “medical assessments”, “Medical Treatments” and “doctor consultation and prescription medications” (in the context of home alcohol detox). The website further named specific medications such as “disulfiram, campral & naltrexone” and “provide medical services”. They also used the term “our” when discussing medical and therapeutic teams and doctors, implying that such registered medical professionals were on the staff of Detox Today. We understood Detox Today offered a range of services to consumers, including therapy and advice for alcohol addiction, and that the services they offered did not require them to be registered with the CQC. However, we further understood that Detox Today did work alongside registered medical professionals, such as GPs and psychiatrists, for instance in providing home detoxes. In such circumstances the roles by Detox Today and the registered professional, while complimentary, were completely separate. The doctor saw to the medical needs of the individual, by prescribing medication and assessing them medically, and Detox Today provided therapy or counselling around the individual’s alcohol addiction. Taken as a whole, we considered that the website did not make a clear delineation between the services offered directly by Detox Today and those performed by third-party professionals. As a consequence, we considered consumers were likely to understand that Detox Today directly provided medical services and had medically qualified staff. The implication of claiming to offer such services was therefore that Detox Today had CQC registration; however, that was not the case. We concluded therefore that the website was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading advertising).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Detox Today to ensure that their advertising did not imply that they employed staff who provided services where they needed to be CQC registered, if they did not.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/detox-today.html
ASA Ruling on MyFlowers Ltd t/a MyFlowers,"On 6 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 6 April 2025, the ASA considered the ads and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 6 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code .","A paid-for Google search ad and a website for MyFlowers, seen on 28 March 2025: a. The paid-for Google search ad stated, “Flowers Harrogate – Flowers in 3 Hours – myflowers.co.uk”. Further text stated, “Same-day & Free Next-day Flower Delivery”. b. The website homepage, myflowers.co.uk, featured the text “Free UK delivery from 3 hours”. A product listing included a graphic near the top of the page, underneath the product’s price and a “Send now” button, which stated, “Delivery in 3 hours from the moment you order”. Further down the page, underneath a list of “Recently Viewed” items, and product reviews, under the heading “Details”, text stated, “Please note, the selected arrangement is available for Same-Day delivery only within London”.","The complainant, who understood that same-day delivery only applied to London, challenged whether the ads were misleading.","MyFlowers Ltd said that they planned to implement changes to their ads and their website to make clear that delivery within three hours from the moment a consumer made a purchase was only possible in selected locations. In relation to ad (b), they said that they would ensure that any significant limitations were clearly communicated when relevant.","The ASA considered consumers would understand from the claim “flowers in 3 hours” in ad (a) that flowers could be delivered within three hours in Harrogate from the moment a consumer made a purchase. In addition, we considered the claim “Same-day & Free Next-day Flower Delivery” would be understood by consumers to mean that same-day and free next-day delivery of flowers was also available in Harrogate. However, we understood that was not the case, because same-day delivery was only available in London. We further considered consumers would understand the claims “Free UK delivery from 3 hours” and “Delivery in 3 hours from the moment you order” in ad (b) to mean that delivery was available within three hours to UK addresses without exception. We acknowledged that text further down the product listing page stated, “the selected arrangement is available for Same-Day delivery only within London”. However, that text was only viewable by scrolling down, and it was possible to proceed to purchase without seeing the text. We considered that qualification was not sufficiently prominent, and in any case, contradicted the claim in the ad, because it had made direct reference to delivery within three hours being possible across the country. We acknowledged that MyFlowers stated they would make changes to their ads, such as by replacing “same-day delivery” in regional ads with “fast delivery” and adding clarification that delivery from 3 hours was only possible in selected areas. However, at the time the ads appeared, they implied that same-day delivery and delivery within three hours was available in all UK locations when this was not the case. We therefore concluded that the ads were misleading and breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 3.9 (Qualifications).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told MyFlowers Ltd to ensure that future ads did not state or imply that same-day delivery was available in all instances, or for all UK addresses, if that was not the case.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/myflowers-ltd-a25-1285210-myflowers-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Nipper&Co Ltd t/a Nipper & Co,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Nipper&Co, a herbal health company, seen on 23 March 2025 promoted their “MUM’S MiLK [sic]” lactation tea. Text in the caption stated, “Our 100% natural lactation tea is made with powerful botanicals [leaf emoji] to encourage breast milk supply and postpartum hormonal balance. It’s helped 1000s of mums on their feeding journey […]”. The ad also featured a video which began by focusing in on the product’s packaging, with overlaid text that stated, “Let’s see what a week of Nipper & Co’s lactation tea does”. The video showed two breast pump bottles, both containing milk, while text stated, “day 1: […]” then showed a person pouring milk into a storage bag with measurements on it, while the text “Morning pump 2oz” appeared. The video then cut to a cup of herbal tea brewing, and back to a person holding a breast pump bottle up to the camera, and overlay text that stated, “7 days of daily tea = 3oz daytime pump” as the person then poured milk into another storage measuring bag, and added it to a pile of similarly filled bags.",The complainant challenged whether the ad included health claims that were in breach of the Code.,"Nipper&Co Ltd t/a Nipper & Co said they had removed the ad and that it would not appear again in the same form. They said they were fully committed to ensuring compliance and avoiding any potentially misleading messaging, and had taken steps internally, including reviewing their process and tightening up controls with their creative partners, to ensure they adhered to the CAP Code in future.","The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied that a relationship existed between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health. Only specific health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims Register (the GB NHC Register) could be made in ads promoting food or drink products. The ASA considered the claim that the tea was “made with powerful botanicals to encourage breast milk supply” stated a relationship between the drink and the production of breast milk in new mothers. We considered that the references to the product’s name, “lactation tea” in the ad, also implied a relationship between the tea and breast milk production. We further considered the video content, which appeared to show someone producing 2oz of breast milk whilst pumping on day one of consuming the tea, which increased to 3oz on day seven of consuming the tea, also implied that the MUM’s MiLK lactation tea could increase how much breast milk a new mother could produce. We considered those were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code. However, we had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that those claims were authorised on the GB NHC Register. We welcomed Nipper & Co’s action to remove the ad. However, because at the time it was seen it included specific health claims that were not authorised on the GB NHC Register, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims)",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Nipper&Co Ltd t/a Nipper & Co to ensure that any specific health claims made in their future advertising were authorised on the GB NHC Register and met the associated conditions of use.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/nipper-co-ltd-a25-1284063-nipper-co-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on PepsiCo International Ltd t/a Lipton Tea,,"Two posts on Instagram and TikTok by Lipton Ice Tea, seen on 18 March 2025. a. The Instagram post contained an image of a can of Peach Lipton Ice Tea with white wings attached, and text that stated, “REST IN PEACH You may have heard that our iconic Peach Lipton Ice Tea flavour is getting discontinued. We know – it hurts (sorry if we’ve ruined your go-to afternoon chill bev). But don’t worry, the rest of your faves are still here to keep you refreshed. And who knows? Maybe one day, Peach will make a legendary comeback. We appreciate your understanding during this period of adjustment and apologize for any inconvenience caused. #RIPeach”. A caption in the post stated. “who’s joining my peach support group? #RIPeach #liptonicetea”. b. The TikTok post contained the same image and text as ad (a).","The complainants, who had believed the peach flavour was being discontinued only to find out the following day that it was an April Fool’s joke and the flavour was not being discontinued, challenged whether the ads were misleading.","PepsiCo International Ltd t/a Lipton Tea said the ad campaign was intended as a light-hearted April Fools’ joke, and that the suggestion that the product would be discontinued was not meant to be taken seriously. They believed the ad would be understood as a joke, that the peach flavour was one of their best-selling products and it was not their intention to mislead consumers.They believed the tone of the ad was playful, and said the content, such as the title “Rest in Peach” was designed to convey humour. They also said the text “maybe one day peach will make a legendary comeback” hinted towards the post being a joke. They said the ads were limited to organic posts on their social media channels, and that many of their followers understood the ad as a joke, as displayed by comments on the posts, including the top comment, which had 60.3 thousand likes, which said, “THIS BETTER BE A JOKE” and other comments that referenced it was likely a marketing campaign. They highlighted that these comments would have had high visibility due to them getting a large number of likes, and would have been high up in the comments section. They had initially planned to reveal the Joke on 1 April 2025, but in response to some negative comments received from consumers, took prompt action by publishing a follow-up post the next day on 19 March 2025, to confirm it was a prank. They believed those actions helped mitigate any misunderstanding and demonstrated their responsiveness to reassure consumers. They said the post was made prior to 1 April to avoid getting lost amongst other brands’ April Fools’ ads, and not to mislead consumers. They said they would learn from these ads and ensure their future campaigns of a similar nature would be more clearly signposted and more carefully timed to avoid misinterpretation.","The ads featured statements such as “our iconic Peach Lipton Ice Tea flavour is getting discontinued” and “We […] apologize [sic] for any inconvenience caused”, which the ASA considered were likely to be understood by consumers to mean the tea was being discontinued. We considered that consumers would likely understand that, because it was being discontinued, there would be a limited amount of time to purchase a peach flavour tea product before stocks ran out, and if they wanted to purchase the product, there would be a time pressure to do so. We understood, however, that the product was not being discontinued. We acknowledged that the advertiser had intended the campaign to be a light-hearted April Fools’ joke, though the ads were posted two weeks prior to April Fools’ Day rather than on the day itself when consumers might typically expect to see April Fools’ jokes. While some of the comments in the posts indicated that some people believed it was a joke that the product was being discontinued, the comments came from consumers, not Lipton Ice Tea, and were not part of the ads. We also noted that the comment section featured comments which suggested consumers were unclear on whether or not the ad was a joke, or serious. We recognised that the ads featured some elements of humour, such as the image of the can with wings, the “REST IN PEACH” headline and “RIPeach” text, but considered those elements were not sufficient to make it clear that the statements about discontinuation were a joke. Therefore, given the timing of the ads and the lack of clear context to explain or suggest that the ads were a joke, we considered they gave the overall impression that the product was being discontinued, when that was not the case, which was likely to affect consumers’ decisions in relation to whether, and in what quantities, to purchase the product. For those reasons, we concluded that the ads were misleading. We welcomed Lipton Tea’s comments that they would ensure future campaigns of a similar nature were clearly signposted as being a joke. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Lipton Tea to ensure their future advertising did not misleadingly give the impression that their products were being discontinued, if that was not the case.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/pepsico-international-ltd-g25-1284970-pepsico-international-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Good Guru Ltd t/a Protein World,,"An email from Protein World sent on 12 March 2025 included the subject heading “WPC Transformed My Life – Overcoming Anorexia”. The email included an image with large text that stated, “Winning Battle WITH ANOREXIA” and two photos of the same girl in gym wear. Text stated, “‘At 13, I battled anorexia and was nearly hospitalized. Gaining muscle felt impossible, but Protein World helped me fuel my body, rebuild strength and find a healthier relationship with food. Now I feel alive!’ – Regina, 16”. Photographs of the Protein World Whey Protein Concentrate were included and further text stated, “Recover Rebuild & Rise with WPC! 35% OFF EVERYTHING USE CODE - HERO SHOP NOW BE THE HERO OF YOUR JOURNEY”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it implied that a food could treat anorexia.,Good Guru Ltd t/a Protein World did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Good Guru Ltd t/a Protein World’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code stated that claims to treat or cure human disease were not permitted for foods or food supplements. We considered that the claim in the subject of the email “WPC Transformed My Life – Overcoming Anorexia” and within the email, “Winning Battle WITH ANOREXIA”, seen alongside the before and after photos of the girl and her testimonial, were claims to treat or cure anorexia. The claims within the testimonial from the girl further implied that the food product, Protein World Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC), had played a significant role in her recovery from anorexia, a serious medical condition. We considered that the overall impression of the ad was that the product could help with recovery from, and therefore was a treatment for, anorexia. We therefore concluded that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Good Guru Ltd t/a Protein World to ensure that their ads did not make claims to treat anorexia or other human diseases.

ASA Ruling on Kenvue UK Ltd t/a Listerine,,"A TV ad for Listerine mouthwash shown on 28 January 2025 depicted a woman in a bathroom facing a mirror about to floss her teeth. An animated donkey appeared behind her in the bath, pulling back the shower curtain. The donkey said, “Good on you. Flossing helps but why not add Listerine.” A picture of the product was then shown and the donkey and on-screen text stated, “PROVEN TO BE 5X MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FLOSS AT REDUCING PLAQUE*”. Superimposed text stated. “*Germ kill provides sustained plaque reduction above the gumline after a dental cleaning”. The woman was then shown gargling mouthwash. Then an animated image of the inside of a person’s mouth was displayed. Mouthwash was shown entering the mouth through the teeth and removing bacteria which were represented by green particles. The voiceover continued, “Listerine gets into the nooks. Into the crannies. Fight the good fight with a swish and a zing.” The woman was then shown with the mouthwash in her mouth, visibly surprised, as her cheeks expanded. Superimposed text stated, “Complete your routine – use alongside brushing and flossing”. The voiceover continued, “When you are taking on plaque, add Listerine.” The donkey appeared behind an image of the product. Superimposed text stated, “PROVEN TO BE 5X MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FLOSS AT REDUCING PLAQUE*”. Qualifying text said, “Complete your routine – use alongside brushing and flossing”.","The complainants, who believed the ad suggested mouthwash as an alternative to flossing was five times more effective, challenged whether the ad was misleading.","Kenvue UK Ltd t/a Listerine said the claim “proven to be 5x more effective than floss at reducing plaque”, which was supported by two published studies, was qualified with text that stated, “*Germ kill provides sustained plaque reduction above the gumline after a dental cleaning”. Therefore, it indicated to the viewer that the effect was on the teeth above the gumline and the ad as a whole would have been seen in that context. In contrast, floss or interdental brushes were recommended between the teeth to clean below the gumline before brushing. They said the ad did not suggest the product had an effect below the gumline and so did not suggest the product should replace floss, but encouraged people to use mouthwash alongside brushing and flossing. They explained further that tooth decay was one of the most common non-contagious diseases in the United Kingdom. It was therefore a contributing factor as to why the ad focused on germ kill and subsequent plaque reduction above the gumline. They said use of floss was also encouraged in the opening frame of the ad where the woman was shown flossing and the voiceover said, “Good on you, flossing helps but why not add Listerine?”. The ad therefore praised the woman for using floss, confirmed flossing was useful and encouraged viewers to add Listerine to their oral health routine. After that a bottle of Listerine was also shown side by side with dental floss, which was clearly labelled, reinforcing the idea that the two products should be complementary. Later on in the ad, superimposed text stated, “Complete your routine – use alongside brushing and flossing”, which they believed was prominent and held long enough for viewers to read, and the final voiceover said, “When you are taking on plaque, add Listerine”. Both again reiterated the message that Listerine should be added as part of an oral health routine, rather than replacing flossing or brushing. They said therefore multiple references were made to flossing and using Listerine alongside flossing and brushing in the 20 seconds the ad ran for, and for that reason the ad did not exaggerate the capability or performance of Listerine. They further stated that the animation of the mouth and Listerine filtering through the teeth demonstrated how mouthwash, due to it being a liquid, could reach all surfaces, including between the teeth. It further demonstrated the anti-bacterial effect of Listerine, which was proven to be 99.9%. The animation did not show food particles being dislodged from the teeth but instead showed bacteria being destroyed from the surface of the teeth and gums. They said that was clear from the green colour and spherical or rod-shaped forms, often associated with bacteria, that would not be mistaken for food or plaque, which was a film. That was especially the case because the qualifying text “*Germ kill provides sustained plaque reduction above the gumline after a dental cleaning” appeared for the duration of the scene. They also explained that the animation clearly showed the mouthwash reaching all the surfaces in the oral cavity. It would therefore not be seen as acting in the same way as floss which was used between the teeth and below the gumline. They stated that overall, the primary message of the ad was to highlight the effectiveness of Listerine in reducing plaque above the gumline. To provide context as to the extent of that benefit, a comparison versus flossing was provided. That was a specific benefit that complemented, rather than replaced, the use of dental floss. The ad emphasised the additional benefit of using Listerine as part of a comprehensive oral health routine, which included brushing and flossing. That would be understood by watching the ad in its entirety and considering it overall, rather than in isolated frames or sections. They confirmed the ad was no longer being broadcast. Clearcast said the ad, including the voiceover, made it clear that Listerine should be used as part of a routine that also included brushing and flossing and that the benefits of all three went together. Therefore, the ad did not state that dental floss should not be used and instead showed it as an important part of teeth cleaning. That was supported by wording of the ad that stated, “Flossing helps but why not add Listerine”, “complete your routine – use alongside brushing and flossing” and “when you’re taking on plaque add Listerine”. In addition, the shot of the product said “use alongside brushing and flossing”. Clearcast said they were happy with the visual representation of plaque removal in the ad, which was not shown as being below the gumline. They explained that the ad made clear that Listerine was to be used after both brushing and flossing, meaning plaque on and between the teeth had already been tackled. In addition, the ad included the claim “plaque reduction above the gumline” and at the beginning of the ad the actor was shown putting the dental floss down, therefore indicating plaque reduction below the gum line had already been completed. They said their consultant had reviewed the evidence and was satisfied that the claim “proven to be 5x more effective than floss at reducing plaque” had been substantiated. In addition, the consultant and Listerine noted that the evidence actually showed that Listerine was nine times more effective than flossing at removing plaque and so the ad underclaimed and did not exaggerate the benefit of the product. Their consultant had said that as long as the mouthwash had been used as directed in the ad, it would access all parts of the mouth and exposed teeth surfaces.","The BCAP Code stated ads must not materially mislead or be likely to do so and must not mislead by exaggerating the capability or performance of a product or service. The ASA acknowledged Listerine’s comments that the ad made frequent references to the product complementing floss, rather than replacing it, either in the voiceover or the visuals of the ad. However, some of those examples, such as the woman shown flossing and the floss shown side by side with Listerine, were fleeting, or in the case of the bottle of Listerine stating ”use alongside brushing and flossing” not clearly legible, and therefore they could have been easily missed by viewers. Other examples, such as when the voiceover stated, “… flossing helps but why not add Listerine?”, “When you are taking on plaque, add Listerine” and the on-screen text “… use alongside brushing and flossing”, were clearer. However, we noted that primary prominence was given to the claim “PROVEN TO BE 5X MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FLOSS AT REDUCING PLAQUE” in terms of the size of the text, as well as appearing in the voiceover. Therefore, we considered that the focus of the ad was on Listerine being five times more effective than floss in removing plaque and was likely to be understood by viewers as a substitute for floss, rather than as complementary. We considered the claim “PROVEN TO BE 5X MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FLOSS AT REDUCING PLAQUE” was likely to be understood in isolation to relate to plaque removal in general. However, we understood the comparison was intended to relate to the removal of plaque only above the gumline. We understood rinsing primarily acted on the surface of the mouth, although some data indicated it had an antibacterial effect below the gums, and killed bacteria that could cause plaque to develop, but did not remove plaque. In contrast, flossing was used to dislodge food particles and also manually remove plaque both below and above the gumline. We considered the qualifying text, “*Germ kill provides sustained plaque reduction above the gumline after a dental cleaning”, was relatively small compared to the headline claim and therefore easily missed or overlooked in contrast to the headline claim. In addition, we considered the wording of the qualification, referencing “Germ kill … after a dental cleaning” did not make it clear that the claim was based on plaque reduction above the gumline using Listerine after brushing versus floss when used alone with brushing. We therefore considered the qualification was insufficient to clarify the impression given by the “5X MORE EFFECTIVE” claim. The animation of Listerine entering the mouth and removing green particles was another prominent part of the ad. It showed Listerine cascading through the teeth and the voiceover stated, “Listerine gets into the nooks. Into the crannies”. We understood the green particles represented bacteria but considered the ad did not make that clear and that they could have been mistaken for plaque or food. We considered, in the context of the claim “PROVEN TO BE 5X MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FLOSS AT REDUCING PLAQUE”, the scene was likely to be understood as suggesting mouthwash acted in the same way as floss, and so was a five times more effective replacement, rather than as relating to complementary plaque removal above the gumline. We considered the ad was ambiguous, but that it was overall likely to be seen as presenting rinsing with Listerine as a superior replacement for flossing. Because we understood that was not the case, we concluded that it misleadingly exaggerated the product’s performance and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP rules 3.1 (Misleadingness), 3.10 (Qualification) and 3.12 (Exaggeration).",The ad must not be broadcast again in the form complained of. We told Kenvue UK Ltd t/a Listerine to ensure future ads did not mislead by exaggerating the capability or performance of a product.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/kenvue-uk-ltd-g25-1285500-kenvue-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Mondelez UK Ltd t/a Cadbury,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A radio ad for Cadbury Delights, heard on 18 January 2025, stated, “Some people might describe Cadbury Delights as just another Cadbury bar. A bit samey. Very familiar. Honestly, we'd be chuffed if they did. Because Delights have that same chocolatey Cadbury taste you've had a million times before. Same soft nougat, same gooey caramel. But they're only 91 calories. So, samey is exactly what we're going for. Cadbury Delights. Same Cadbury, only 91 calories.”",,"1. Mondelez UK Ltd t/a Cadbury said that the ad was submitted to Radiocentre and was approved. They also confirmed that the ad was no longer being broadcast. Their intention with the claim “only 91 calories” was to provide factual information about the product’s calorific content per bar, rather than to make a “low energy” nutrition claim. They had conducted consumer research, including qualitative surveys and creative testing, to understand consumers’ interpretation of the ad. The research indicated that factual calorie information was a significant factor for their consumers, who appreciated knowing the calorie content of their products. The statement was created in line with Cadbury brand’s tone of voice while also providing relevant calorie information. They did not intend to give a misleading impression of the nutrition or health benefits of the product. They said that they would amend the statement in future ads to address the complainant’s concerns and ensure there was no implication of a nutritional claim. 2. They understood the ASA’s concern that the ad could be interpreted as making an “energy reduced” comparative nutrition claim. Their consumer research provided insights into how consumers perceived the overall messaging of the ad. The majority of consumers understood that the ad as to be highlighting the taste of Cadbury Delights and suggesting that it delivered the same taste experience as other Cadbury chocolate products that they enjoyed. They also confirmed that Cadbury Delights used the same Cadbury chocolate found in most Cadbury-branded chocolate bars. Their intention was to emphasise the consistent Cadbury experience, not to make an “energy reduced” comparative claim. 1. & 2. Radiocentre said that during the course of the campaign submissions, they had initially cleared the claim “contains 91 calories” and they had not identified that the claim had changed to “only 91 calories”.","Only nutrition claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB NHC Register) could be made in ads promoting food or drink products. The BCAP Code defined a nutrition claim as any claim which stated, suggested or implied that a food (or drink) had particular beneficial nutritional properties due to the amount of calories, nutrients or other substances it contained, did not contain, or contained in reduced or increased proportions. In addition, the advertiser must ensure that the product met the conditions of use associated with the authorised claim. The ASA considered that in the context of the ad, which compared Cadbury Delights bars with other Cadbury products, the use of the statement “only 91 calories”, spoken twice in quick succession during the ad, served to emphasise that 91 calories was a low amount of calories for a chocolate bar. We therefore considered that listeners would understand the claim “only 91 calories” as a low calorie claim, which was equivalent to the “low energy” nutrition claim authorised on the GB NHC Register. The conditions of use for that claim allowed it to be made only where a product did not contain more than 40 kcal per 100 g for solids. We understood, however, that Cadbury Delights products contained either 413 or 415 kcal per 100 g, depending on the flavour of the product. We concluded that the claim “only 91 calories” was a “low energy” nutrition claim, but the Cadbury Delights products did not meet the conditions of use for that claim, and it therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached BCAP Code rules 13.4, 13.4.1 and 13.4.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health and nutrition claims). As referenced above, the ad compared Cadbury Delights bars with other Cadbury products, emphasising their similarity while implying that Cadbury Delights were low in calories. We considered that, in addition to that interpretation, listeners were also likely to interpret the claim “[…] Delights have that same chocolatey Cadbury taste […] Same soft nougat, same gooey caramel. But they're only 91 calories” to mean that by choosing a Cadbury Delights bar, they would get the same ingredients and taste experience as with other Cadbury bars, but with fewer calories. We therefore considered listeners were likely understand the ad to be implying that Cadbury Delights were a comparable, reduced-calorie alternative to other Cadbury chocolate bars, particularly those that featured nougat or caramel. Because of this, we considered that the ad included an implied “energy reduced” comparative nutrition claim. The BCAP code stated that comparative nutrition claims must compare the difference in the claimed nutrient to a range of foods of the same category which did not have the composition that allowed them to bear a nutrition claim. In the case of “energy reduced” comparative nutrition claims, the conditions of use stated on the GB NHC Register included that the energy value must be reduced by at least 30%, with an indication of the characteristics which made the food reduced in its total energy value. However, we understood that none of the Cadbury Delights products had 30% fewer calories than other Cadbury chocolate bars. We concluded that the ad made an “energy reduced” comparative nutrition claim in relation to Cadbury Delights products, but the products did not meet the conditions of use for that claim, and it therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached BCAP Code rules 13.4, 13.4.1, 13.4.2, 13.5.1, 13.5.2 and 13.5.3 (Food, food supplements and associated health and nutrition claims).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Mondelez UK Ltd t/a Cadbury to ensure that when making nutrition and comparative nutrition claims they held evidence to show that the relevant products met the conditions of use for the claim.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/mondelez-europe-services-gmbh---uk-branch-a25-1276004-mondelez-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Wowcher Ltd,,"A website for Wowcher, www.wowcher.co.uk, seen on 13 March 2025, featured a listing for “K18 Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask”. The listing included an image of a bottle of hair product which featured the text “15ml”. Superimposed text read “NOW £28.99 £64.99 [crossed out]”. Text underneath the image stated, “SAVE 55 percent!”. Further text under the heading “Full Details” stated, “We’re offering you a K18 Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask for £28.99, saving you up to 55 percent off Global Fulfillment Limited [sic] (Forever cosmetics)’s’s [sic] price of £64.99 (correct as of 20.06.2024)"".",The complainant challenged whether the reference price and the associated savings claim were misleading.,"Wowcher Ltd stated that the merchant whose original selling price the ad referenced had not informed them that they were having a sale, which changed the price of the product to £39.99. They stated references to the price £64.99 had been removed from the listing. They added that they carried out regular checks on reference prices displayed on their site to ensure they were accurate, but on this occasion the issue was not identified prior to the ASA’s investigation.","The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) Guidance for Traders on Pricing Practices offered practical advice to traders on consumer protection laws and associated practices. While we noted that the guidance provided a set of principles rather than statutory rules, we took the Guidance into account when making our assessment. The Guidance stated that it was important that price comparisons were genuine. Comparing a current price to a higher one when it was not the last price the product was sold at, because there had been intervening prices, was an example given in the Guidance of a price comparison that might not be genuine. The Guidance also stated that, when considering whether a price comparison was genuine, attention should be given to whether the stated reference price was a realistic selling price for that product. The ASA understood that Wowcher was an e-commerce website through which consumers could purchase vouchers that afforded them a discount on a product or service, and that they did not sell their own products. Instead, consumers redeemed a voucher purchased from Wowcher with a merchant in order to arrange receipt of the goods or service. Because they allowed third-party merchants to advertise offers on their website, we considered that Wowcher were responsible for ensuring that those offers represented a genuine saving. We understood that the hair product advertised was available in different sizes, and that the ad was for a 15 ml bottle of that product. The ad stated, “NOW £28.99 £64.99 [crossed out]” and “SAVE 55 percent!”. We considered consumers would understand from those claims that £64.99 was the usual price at which the relevant merchant sold the product, and that by purchasing and redeeming the voucher they would achieve a genuine saving against the usual price of the product. In order to demonstrate that £64.99 was a realistic, usual selling price for that size of the product, we expected Wowcher to provide evidence that a significant number of sales had been made at that price. We did not receive detailed sales or pricing history for the product from Wowcher. However, we understood that £64.99 was not the immediately preceding price of the product, because the merchant whose price Wowcher was referencing currently had the product on sale for £39.99. We did not know for how long the product had been on sale, however, we noted from the ad that the last time the reference price had been verified as correct was June 2024. We therefore considered the savings claim for the product had not been made against the immediately preceding price at which the product was sold when the ad appeared. We also considered this suggested that £64.99 was not the usual selling price for that size of the product. Consequently, that meant the quoted 55 per cent saving was not genuine. Because we had not seen evidence that the savings claims made represented a genuine saving against the usual selling price of the product, we concluded the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (Prices).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Wowcher Ltd to ensure that future savings claims did not mislead and that they substantiated any savings claims against the usual selling price of the product.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/wowcher-ltd-a25-1282964-wowcher-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Wowcher Ltd,,"A website for Wowcher, www.wowcher.co.uk, seen in March 2025, featured a mystery holiday offer. A banner at the top of the webpage included the claim “FROM £99pp + Est £3.99 admin fee*”. Text stated, “Mystery Holiday™: Maldives, New York, Mexico, Dubai, Bali, Disneyland Paris & More!”. Further text under the heading “How Does Mystery Holidays™ Work?” stated, “Purchase your Mystery Holiday for you and your travel companion. You will then receive your voucher codes and a link for redemption. Next, select preferred travel dates. Customers must redeem their vouchers as soon as possible using the link provided. You will then be asked to complete information relevant to your holiday booking. Your holiday destination will then be revealed! The merchant will then contact you via text message, telephone or email to arrange your flights from your desired airport region and inform you of where you’ll be staying. Then? Your holiday is booked and ready for you!”.","The complainant, who purchased a £99 mystery holiday, but was unable to book the holiday to the destination they were offered, challenged whether the promotion had been administered fairly.","Wowcher Ltd stated that they were a third-party marketplace and were not involved with the consumer journey after a purchase had been made. Before allowing a merchant to publish their offer on the Wowcher website, they required that the merchant gave assurances about the price and availability of the offer. Although the Mystery Holiday deal was promoted on the Wowcher website, it was fulfilled through third-party travel providers. Wowcher acknowledged that the complainant should have been able to book the holiday that they had been offered, since the third-party travel provider had uploaded an availability file with that date and destination. However, due to the dynamic nature of holiday prices and availability, at the point that the merchant contacted the complainant, they could no longer provide the holiday destination offered for that price. They understood from the third-party travel provider that the complainant had been offered alternative destinations and dates at the advertised price. Nevertheless, they had taken the decision to remove the travel provider from their Mystery Holiday merchant list.","The CAP Code stated that promoters were responsible for all aspects and stages of their promotions, which must be administered fairly and avoid causing unnecessary disappointment. It also stated that promoters, agencies, and intermediaries should not give consumers justifiable grounds for complaint. The ASA understood that Wowcher was an e-commerce website through which consumers could purchase vouchers that afforded them a discount on a product or service, and that they did not sell their own products. For Wowcher’s Mystery Holidays, Wowcher acted as the promoter for the offer. Once consumers purchased a voucher, they were required to select their preferred travel dates, airport region, and had to supply passenger information. The location of their holiday was then revealed based on availability provided by the third-party travel provider, who contacted the consumer to confirm the details of their holiday. We considered that consumers would understand from the ad that once their holiday destination had been revealed, they would be able to book a holiday to that destination without making any additional payments, unless a regional airport fee applied. As the consumer had already made the payment and provided their preferred travel dates before their holiday destination was revealed, we considered it was reasonable to expect that a holiday to that destination was available for that price. However, we understood that the complainant, who was told their holiday destination would be Rome, was unable to book a holiday to that destination because it was no longer available. Instead, we understood they were offered alternative destinations, which required an additional payment. We acknowledged that Wowcher did not provide the holidays themselves and had no part in the consumer journey after a Mystery Holiday voucher had been redeemed. We also understood that travel was a fast-moving sector where pricing and availability could change frequently. However, we considered that as the promoter for the deal, Wowcher had a responsibility to ensure that it was administered fairly at all stages. We understood that the link through which consumers entered their travel dates to reveal their holiday destination was supplied by Wowcher. Consumers were likely to view the reveal of their holiday destination as exciting, and experience considerable disappointment if they were subsequently unable to travel to that destination. We therefore considered Wowcher should have taken reasonable steps to avoid disappointing participants, for example, by ensuring that the third-party travel providers’ holiday information was accurate. Because the complainant had not been able to book the Mystery Holiday they had been offered, we considered that the promotion had not been administered fairly and was likely to have caused participants unnecessary disappointment. The promotion breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.1 and 8.2 (Promotional marketing) and 8.14 (Administration).",We told Wowcher Ltd to ensure that their promotions were administered fairly and to ensure that their promotions did not cause unnecessary disappointment.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/wowcher-ltd-a25-1284837-wowcher-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Bodystreet Franchise (UK) Ltd t/a Bodystreet,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website, www.bodystreet.co.uk, for Bodystreet, a fitness studio in Eastcote, featured the text “Bodystreet is an innovative workout studio that combines expert personal training with the buzz of Electro Muscle Stimulation (EMS)”. It explained that “At Bodystreet you wear a special training suit that helps your muscles work harder”. It stated, “We are Europe’s leading provider of EMS training”. Other text stated, “You can reach all your health & fitness goals with Bodystreet Eastcote - the fitness studio where 20 minutes of exercise is enough for the week!”. Under the heading, “Only 20 minutes”, the website stated, “In conventional exercise your muscles work between 40 to 70% of their capacity. During a Bodystreet workout your muscles work to more than 90% of their capacity. And that's with every contraction. With a Bodystreet workout using our high-tech suit you are able to achieve 85 contractions (reps) per second. This makes the training both intensive efficient and effective - hence only 20-minutes per week”. Elsewhere the website read, “This revolutionary fitness system is so effective that one 20 minute workout a week is enough to meet most people's goals and approximately 95% of our members at Bodystreet Eastcote train only once a week to achieve their fitness or weight loss goals […]. With Bodystreet all it takes is 20 minutes a week […]”. The website also stated, “EMS training doesn't just exercise and build up your muscles. It also stimulates the metabolism, which leads to a significant reduction in body fat within a very short time”.",The complainant challenged whether the following claims were misleading and could be substantiated:,"1. & 2. Bodystreet Franchise (UK) Ltd t/a Bodystreet said they understood the volume and level of evidence required to substantiate claims in their advertising. They submitted a meta-analysis, a systematic review, a combined systematic review and meta-analysis and three studies. They also provided an article on electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), a research-institute overview and two pieces of guidance from the NHS. They said their primary target customer base consisted of middle-aged or older adults, people returning to exercise after a long break, individuals with limited time or mobility, and people who found conventional gyms unapproachable or unsuitable. They believed that the cohorts within the studies provided were representative of their target customer base. Bodystreet explained that guidelines for safe use of EMS stipulated it should not exceed 20 minutes for all but the most athletic, due to intensity and recovery time, and to avoid the risk of muscle damage. They said that the statement that one session per week was sufficient was grounded in widely accepted industry guidance which cautioned against using EMS more than once per week. They said that this guidance came from the equipment manufacturer, their franchisor and an industry association. They were concerned that removing the reference to one session per week could encourage unsafe training frequency and expose consumers to health risks from excessive EMS usage. It was their operational experience that significant weight loss had been achieved through adherence to the Bodystreet method with only one session per week. They said that was supported by extensive member feedback across their studios and that 95% of their members trained once a week. They said that EMS training had been associated with various health and fitness benefits, including increased muscle strength, improved body composition, and enhanced physical performance. Bodystreet said that EMS could stimulate all major muscle groups simultaneously with adjustable intensity, making it time effective and, because of its low mechanical impact EMS was suitable for individuals regardless of age, size, mobility and fitness level, including those with joint problems. Bodystreet believed EMS induced short-term changes in muscle metabolism, as well as long-term improvements in muscle function and reductions in intramuscular fat. They said that increasing muscle mass through strength training sped up metabolic rate, made the body more efficient at burning calories and could lead to fat loss, when combined with a balanced diet. 3. Bodystreet believed they were the first company to introduce EMS boutique fitness studios and an EMS studio franchise model in 2007. They said they led the market with equipment innovation and workout methods. That was the basis of their claim to be Europe’s leading provider of EMS training. Notwithstanding that was the basis of the “leading” claim, they also said they had the most number of studios and memberships in Europe, and could also rely on size to make the claim. They provided a 2025 report on the European health and fitness market, produced by a non-profit organisation representing the European fitness sector, in conjunction with a consultancy firm. They said that they had been consistently recognised in this annual report as the leading EMS studio operator in Europe. They believed none of the other operators listed in the 2025 report specialised in EMS-only studios and that this substantiated their claim to be Europe’s leading provider.","The ASA considered that consumers would understand claims such as “one 20 minute workout a week is enough to meet most people's goals and approximately 95% of our members at Bodystreet Eastcote train only once a week to achieve their fitness or weight loss goals” to mean that one 20-minute EMS session at Bodystreet per week would provide an individual with the same physiological results, such as weight loss, cardio and muscle improvements, as a longer weekly session or multiple sessions at a traditional gym, and could therefore be a time-saving alternative. We considered that consumers would interpret it as an efficacy claim rather than a caution against using EMS more frequently. We acknowledged Bodystreet’s comments regarding their target customer base, however the claim referred to “most people” and therefore any evidence supporting that claim needed to be relevant to the general population. We considered that consumers would understand the claim “stimulates the metabolism, which leads to a significant reduction in body fat within a very short time” to mean EMS training would lead to a reduction in body fat in a very short time compared to a traditional gym workout because it stimulated the metabolism. As above, we considered that because the claim was not qualified to apply to particular groups of people, the evidence supporting it needed to relate to the general population. A substantive body of relevant evidence, consisting of clinical trials conducted on humans that had been published and peer-reviewed, was needed to substantiate both claims. We assessed the evidence provided by Bodystreet.The meta-analysis considered the results of five trials which measured the effects of whole-body EMS (W-BEMS) on people who had been classified as being at moderate to high cardiometabolic risk. The trials recorded the effects of W-BEMS on the participants’ metabolic syndrome score which included measurements for blood pressure, triglycerides, abdominal circumference and insulin resistance. We considered that cohort did not represent the general population, and the measurement outcomes were not relevant to the claims that one 20-minute session of EMS would provide equivalent benefits to longer sessions at a conventional gym or that EMS stimulated the metabolism to reduce fat in a very short time. We therefore considered the meta-analysis was not adequate substantiation for the claims in the ad. The systematic review covered 21 peer-reviewed studies that had applied electrical stimulation in lower and upper limbs simultaneously. The review authors observed that the studies exhibited a moderate to high risk of bias and noted a lack of randomised controlled studies on the subject. They commented that the limited amount of scientific evidence found did not allow for definitive conclusions about the effects of WB-EMS. We therefore considered that the systematic review was not adequate substantiation for the claims. The combined systematic review and meta-analysis covered 16 studies with 897 participants. The studies included some controlled trials, and WB-EMS trials with at least one exercise group and one control group. Across the studies, cohorts were of various ages, body mass indexes and physical conditions, although many studies focused on specific cohorts or conditions such as obesity or back pain. The authors acknowledged this restricted the extent to which the outcomes could be generalised. While WB-EMS was the only intervention in most of the studies, two combined WB-EMS with other interventions. This included a study on people with metabolic syndrome where participants had a calorie-restricted diet. The review reported some positive effects of WB-EMS effects on muscle mass and strength but not on total body fat. Furthermore, the results would apply predominately to moderately old to older, untrained or at least non-athletic cohorts, rather than the general population. The training frequency and duration of the interventions varied across the studies, from one to five sessions per week and were not limited to one 20-minute session of WB-EMS per week. Due to those limitations, we considered that the combined systematic review and meta-analysis was not adequate substantiation for the 20 minutes per week or metabolism-stimulation claims in the ad. The first of the three studies looked at the effect of EMS training on intramuscular fat in older adults. The cohort of 19 comprised nine women and 10 men, aged between 61 and 78. They performed EMS training of a specific muscle group on the front thigh three times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 30 minutes. Because the study had a small, unrepresentative cohort, exercised only one part of the body, lacked a control group, had more frequent and longer sessions than 20 minutes per week, and the only outcome measure was intramuscular fat, we considered it was not adequate substantiation for the claims. The second study looked at the effect of exercise training on fat loss. As it did not refer to EMS, we considered that it was not adequate to substantiate the claims. The third study looked at metabolic responses and muscle fatigue during whole body WB-EMS, voluntary exercise and their combination. It was partly funded by a manufacturer of fitness products and used a custom-made stimulator, based on a commercially developed device, for 15-minute exercise sessions. The cohort comprised 13 healthy men aged around 20. While the study suggested that the combination of W-BEMS, with low to middle intensity exercise could enhance metabolic response to a level equivalent to high intensity exercise, we considered that this did not equate to the claim that it stimulated the metabolism in such a way as to lead to a significant reduction in body fat in a very short time compared to a traditional gym workout. Furthermore, the study’s cohort was small and not representative of the general population. Also, the study did not include a control group and it was unclear whether the device used was the same as, or equivalent to, Bodystreet’s device. We therefore considered that the study was not adequate substantiation for the claims. We considered that the article, research-institute overview and NHS guidance, which provided generic information, some of which was unrelated to EMS, were not adequate substantiation for the claims. We concluded that the claims that 20 minutes of training at Bodystreet’s studio was enough for a week and therefore would provide an individual with the same physiological results, such as weight loss, cardio and muscle improvements, as a longer weekly session or multiple sessions at a traditional gym had not been substantiated. Neither had the claim that it stimulated the metabolism leading to a significant reduction in body fat in a very short time been substantiated, We therefore concluded the claims were misleading. On those points, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.11 (Exaggeration). We understood that Bodystreet had intended the claim “We are Europe’s leading provider of EMS training” to be a first-to-market claim. However, the claim was not qualified and we considered, in that context and in the absence of further explanatory text, consumers were likely to understand it to mean they were the market leader in Europe and therefore had the largest turnover. We acknowledged Bodystreet’s comment that they had the most number of studios and memberships in Europe, and we considered the report provided by them. The report was published in 2025, after the ad was seen. Notwithstanding that, whilst the report stated that Bodystreet had a large number of clubs in Europe (284), it did not state that Bodystreet was the largest provider of EMS training in Europe. Furthermore, the report did not cover all fitness chains in Europe and it stated that the information provided within it had not been verified or audited. We therefore considered that the report was not adequate substantiation for the claim. We concluded that the claim “We are Europe’s leading provider of EMS training” had not been substantiated and was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Bodystreet Franchise (UK) Ltd t/a Bodystreet not to claim that 20 minutes of exercise at their studio was enough for a week or that their EMS training stimulates the metabolism sufficient to reduce body fat within a very short time, unless they held adequate substantiation for the claims.

ASA Ruling on SaffPro,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A TikTok post and a paid-for Facebook post for SaffPro, a range of saffron-containing supplements: a. The TikTok post, on Chantelle Knight’s account, neurodiverselife2, seen on 21 December 2024. The video, a duet with the SaffPro TikTok account, featured Ms Knight, an internet personality with links to the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) community, who stated, “Why would we choose a nutraceutical over a pharmaceutical?” as images of SaffPro product packs, then generic pills, appeared next to her on-screen. She continued, “There are people who will respond to certain pharmaceutical medications, but there will always be people who do not respond to them […] there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people out there who do not choose to put pharmaceutical drugs in their body; another reason for this is the incredible withdrawals and side effects that can come with them […] Bringing nutraceuticals to the discussion around physical and mental health is incredibly important […] It is an exceptionally exciting time to see somebody starting to stand up and challenge what we are led to believe is the only way to manage our cognitive and emotional function.” A voice-over at the end of the video, accompanied by images of SaffPro products, included “These powerful gummies and pops combine the best of nutrition and medicine, helping you stay strong, focused and energised every day. With our SaffPro products, your sleep will be at ease, increased mood stability, and it comes with powerful antioxidant.” b. The paid-for Facebook post from SaffPro, posted on 4 February 2025, also featured Ms Knight discussing SaffPro products, who made a number of claims including, “Saffron […] supports the creation of Dopamine”, “stimulant ADHD medicine will increase dopamine, but so will saffron”, “I choose SaffPro”, “Saffron is also known as an anti-inflammatory”, “saffron boosts serotonin […] a really key chemical in the management of ADHD, and saffron will boost your serotonin levels through the roof”, and “Saffron directly increases the amount of melatonin that we have in our system”.",The complainant challenged whether:,"1., 2. & 3. Saff-Pro LLC t/a SaffPro did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.Chantelle Knight said she was willing to make any necessary changes to her posts to ensure compliance with the CAP Code.","The ASA was concerned by SaffPro’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. The CAP Code (which reflected legislation) stated that claims which stated or implied a food prevented, treated or cured human disease were not acceptable in marketing communications for foods or food supplement products. Ad (b) included claims that people with ADHD did not have enough dopamine, serotonin or melatonin and that this led to ADHD symptoms such as lack of focus, a difficulty in regulating emotions and issues with sleep. It also stated that neuroinflammation exacerbated ADHD symptoms. In that context we considered claims such as the following would be understood as claims that SaffPro products could treat ADHD and its symptoms: “I can get more dopamine to access the chemicals that I need to stay focused, stay motivated, and regulate my emotions”; “boost your serotonin levels through the roof""; “increases the amount of melatonin that we have in our system”; and “Saffron is also known as an anti-inflammatory”. The ad further included the claim that by consuming SaffPro products “we are supporting and promoting a healthier, happier brain environment and therefore supporting our ADHD”. We considered that was also a claim the products could treat ADHD. We acknowledged that ad (a), which was posted from Ms Knight’s TikTok account, did not directly reference ADHD. However, we noted Ms Knight’s wider presentation as a person with deep ties to the ADHD community, and that her posts on TikTok and other social media platforms primarily related to ADHD. Additionally, we considered her TikTok username, @neurodiverselife2, reinforced her links to, and association with, the neurodiverse community, which typically included people with ADHD. In that context, we considered that the discussion in ad (a) around the use of “nutraceuticals” instead of, or in combination with, “pharmaceutical” medications would be understood by viewers to relate to their use as a treatment for conditions including ADHD. The ad referred to SaffPro products as “nutraceuticals” and we therefore considered viewers would understand that those products could treat ADHD. Because of that, we also considered viewers were likely to understand some of the claims in the voice-over at the end of the ad as referencing symptoms of ADHD, and that SaffPro products could treat those symptoms: “These powerful gummies and pops combine the best of nutrition and medicine, helping you stay […] focused […] With our SaffPro products, your sleep will be at ease, increased mood stability […]”. Claims that SaffPro products could treat ADHD and its symptoms were, for the purposes of the legislation reflected in the Code, claims that a food or food supplement could prevent, treat or cure disease, and were therefore prohibited by the Code. We therefore concluded that all the above claims in ads (a) and (b) breached the Code. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code stated that only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB NHC Register) were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. The Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health. The voice-over at the end of ad (a) included the claims “These powerful gummies and pops combine the best of nutrition and medicine, helping you stay strong […] and energised every day […] and it comes with powerful antioxidant”. We considered viewers were unlikely to associate those claims with the treatment of symptoms of ADHD and would instead understand them as describing health benefits the products would provide for all consumers: that is, the support of physical strength, energy levels and the protection of cells from oxidative stress. We considered those claims were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code. We had not seen evidence that demonstrated they were authorised on the GB NHC Register in relation to the supplement or any of its ingredients. We therefore concluded ad (a) also breached the Code in that regard. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims), and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). Ad (a) stated that some people would not respond to “pharmaceutical” medications, and that millions of people chose not to use medications due to the associated withdrawals and side effects. As referenced above, we considered consumers would understand from the context of the ad, its presentation of images of SaffPro products, and the presence of Ms Knight and her TikTok username, @neurodiverselife2, that the term “pharmaceutical medications” was referring to medications prescribed for the treatment of ADHD. Ad (b) referred to parents “using stimulant medication through the day […] and then something like an antipsychotic […] at night to help put their child to sleep”, and included claims which implied that saffron, a key ingredient in SaffPro’s products, could produce the same effects as medicines prescribed for the treatment of ADHD, such as improving focus, providing a calming effect, and helping with attention and concentration. We considered that in making those claims, both ads suggested that consumers, including children, could take the advertised supplement as an effective alternative to medically prescribed treatments. We considered that the wording of ad (a), and the reference to withdrawal and side-effects, could also have the effect of undermining consumer’s confidence in medicines prescribed for the treatment of ADHD. We further considered that the claims in ad (b) implied that SaffPro’s products were equivalent to medicines prescribed to treat ADHD and noted that the ad specifically addressed parents of children with ADHD. We therefore considered the claims were irresponsible. Because both ads irresponsibly discouraged people from taking medically prescribed treatments for ADHD, including parents who supervised their children’s medical treatment, we concluded that they breached the Code. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Saff-Pro LLC t/a SaffPro not to make specific health claims about their products unless they were authorised on the GB NHC Register, and to ensure their future advertising did not make claims that food, including food supplements, could prevent, treat or cure conditions that, for the purposes of the Code, fell within the definition of human disease. We also told them to ensure their ads did not irresponsibly encourage consumers to stop taking medically prescribed treatments for ADHD. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/saffpro.html
ASA Ruling on CLF Distribution Ltd,,"An email from CLF Distribution, a health food wholesaler, seen on 10 December 2024. The body of the email included the headline “These jams are crafted with high-quality, naturally sweet ingredients”. Below the headline, there was an image of four flavours of jam. Text within the image stated, “NO ADDED SUGAR? SWEET!”. Further text stated, “These jams are crafted with high-quality, naturally sweet ingredients that deliver all the fruity flavour and richness of traditional jams without the sugar spike”.","The complainant challenged whether the claim “naturally sweet ingredients” was misleading, because the products contained erythritol and steviol glycosides.",CLF Distribution Ltd did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by CLF Distribution Ltd’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The ASA considered that traders would understand the term “naturally sweet ingredients” to mean the sweetening ingredients in the product were completely natural. We considered traders would understand that some processing may need to take place in order to make a naturally found ingredient fit for human consumption, but that such processing would be minimal. Ingredients which underwent more than minimal processing were unlikely to be understood as completely natural. The jams promoted in the ad included the sweetener erythritol, a sugar alcohol. We understood that in commercial production, erythritol was manufactured through a corn fermentation process, rather than having been directly isolated or extracted from a plant. We further understood that the purification of erythritol typically involved an ion exchange. We considered those types of processing would not be understood by traders to be in line with their expectations of a sweetener described as a “naturally sweet ingredient”. The jams also included steviol glycosides. We acknowledged that this sweetener was derived from a natural source, the stevia plant. However, we understood that to isolate steviol glycosides from the stevia plant, manufacturers used multiple chemical processes including extraction with solvents, filtration, ion exchange and crystallisation. We considered those types of processing were unlikely to be in line with traders’ expectations of a sweetener described as a “naturally sweet ingredient”. For the above reasons, we concluded that the claim “naturally sweet ingredients” was not substantiated and therefore the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).",The ad must not appear again in its current form.

ASA Ruling on Navi Organics Ltd,"On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ad and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code .

Individualized Microcurrent Frequency (IMF) programs of the Healy device, Quantum Potential Frequencies (QPF) of the Healy Coil and the magnetic field programs of the MagHealy device are not acknowledged by conventional medicine due to the lack of scientific evidence in the sense of conventional medicine. The information on this page is for reference and educational purposes only.”",The Good Thinking Society challenged whether the following claims for the product were misleading and could be substantiated:,"1., 2. & 3. Na’vi Organics Ltd (Na’vi) said the ad appeared on their website as part of the Healy affiliate programme; they did not, however, actively promote the device to their customer base. Na’vi explained that they had sourced the content directly from the Healy website and it had not been reviewed it for several years. They said they were willing to make changes to bring their advertising in line with the Code.","The ad stated, “The Healy is a bio-resonance tool that works to support your body’s energetic field to promote deep cellular healing. Reduced cell voltage occurs in almost all case of acute and chronic dis-ease […] The Healy can help restore equilibrium through the use of resonant frequency waves.” The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the ad that bio-resonance could affect cell health positively by providing equilibrium for cell voltage. We also considered that they would infer from the claim “Reduced cell voltage occurs in almost all cases of acute and chronic dis-ease [sic]” that the device could identify and treat underlying health issues. The ad also referred to conditions such as fibromyalgia, sleep problems and anxiety. We considered that in the context of an ad that referred to healing, consumers would understand that the device was effective in treating the listed medical conditions. We were previously made aware by the advertiser that the Healy was classified as a Class IIa medical device. However, CE certification in itself did not constitute evidence for medical efficacy claims, and advertisers needed to ensure that they held evidence for such claims. We had not been provided with any evidence that the product could be used to diagnose existing or future medical conditions or prevent or treat disease or illness. Furthermore, we had not seen evidence to support the claims in the ad regarding the role of bio-resonance in cellular healing. We welcomed Na’vi’s willingness to make changes to their advertising. However, because we had not seen evidence to support the claims that the device could treat the listed medical conditions, nor had we received substantiation for the claims about bio-resonance, we concluded that the ad was likely to mislead. On those points, the ad breached CAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). The CAP Code stated that marketers must not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. For example, they must not offer specific advice on, diagnosis of, or treatment for such conditions, unless that advice, diagnosis or treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. The ad stated, “We were not designed to be depressed”. Additionally, the reference to Healy’s status as a medical device listed migraine among the conditions that could be treated. The ad also referred to chronic pain. We considered that consumers would understand from the ad that they could use the device to treat depression, migraine and chronic pain. The Code required that treatment for those conditions be conducted under medical supervision. We acknowledged that the “NOTICE” section stated that the device should not be treated as a substitute for medical advice and that a qualified medical professional should always be consulted. However, the ad also featured a heading “Easy to use” which described setting up the device and connecting the electrodes. The ad further stated, “You can use the device for prolonged periods, of time, running continuous programs throughout the day or just occasionally to boost your vitality and well-being as needed. For example, at the end of a stressful day at work.” We considered that the ad presented the device as being for home use, without any initial or ongoing monitoring or supervision by a medical professional. We also considered that the “NOTICE” text, which appeared at the foot of the web page, could easily be overlooked by consumers and was insufficient to counter the overall impression given by the ad. We therefore concluded that the ad discouraged essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought and that it had breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.2 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Na’vi Organics Ltd not to make efficacy claims for the Healy Device in the absence of adequate evidence. We also told them to ensure their future ads did not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought, including depression, migraine and chronic pain.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/navi-organics-ltd-a24-1272405-navi-organics-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on LiveScore Betting & Gaming (Gibraltar) Ltd t/a LiveScore Bet,,"Two in-app ads for LiveScore Bet seen on LiveScore, a football score app, on 10 January 2025: a. The first ad, viewed on an Android device, featured text that displayed live football scores. The page also featured the LiveScore Bet logo next to an on/off toggle. When toggled on, three ‘odds’ options were displayed under each game. Each option linked through to the “LiveScore Bet” app when clicked on. b. The second ad, viewed on an IOS device, featured a page which displayed football team lineups. Beneath the lineups a banner displayed text which stated, “Match odds” and “LiveScore Bet” along with three different odds that linked through to the LiveScore Bet app when clicked. Further smaller text stated, “18+ Bet responsibly. BeGambleAware.org” and “Ad”.","The complainant, who understood the ads were served in the under-18 version of the app, challenged whether they had been appropriately targeted.","LiveScore Betting and Gaming (Gibraltar) Ltd t/a LiveScore Bet said they were a distinct product from the LiveScore app. However, they both operated within the same corporate structure, which was the “LiveScore Group”. They explained that LiveScore was a real-time sports data, news and content provider that did not offer gambling services whilst LiveScore Bet was a licensed online sports-betting product. LiveScore Bet said they selected LiveScore as an advertising partner because of the app’s audience demographic which they believed was predominantly adults. They also said LiveScore implemented an age-gating tool that was a voluntary safeguard used to prevent adult content from being shown to under-18s. They explained that through the age-gating mechanism the LiveScore app would only display odds and gambling content to users who had declared themselves as over-18. LiveScore Bet carried out testing on the under-18 version of the app for Android devices because the complainant believed they saw ad (a) there. However, they had been unable to replicate instances of any gambling content being shown when the under-18 option was selected. They believed no further device information for where the ad had been viewed was available and there was no proof that there had been any technical problem with the app for Android devices. They were therefore confident that LiveScore’s age-gating tool had been working as intended at the time ad (a) was seen, with the under-18 version not promoting any gambling content. LiveScore Bet also said a technical problem in a historic IOS version of the app had resulted in gambling content being displayed to users who had selected ‘under-18’, which was why ad (b) had been seen in that version of the app. However, they believed further testing indicated that where odds had been displayed, they did not link through to any further gambling content. They also said the current version of the app was working correctly and the issue had been confined to one IOS app version that would have impacted a small number of users.","The CAP Code required that marketing communications for gambling must not be directed at those aged younger than 18 years through the selection of media or context in which they appeared. The ASA understood that when first using the LiveScore app, users were presented with text which stated, “Please help us […] by selecting the correct age category” and “Livescore carries advertising […] some of this advertising and other content is not suitable for younger members of our audience (for example it may be gambling or alcohol related)”. Below that text, two option boxes stated, “Under 18” and “18 & Over” which could be clicked on to access the app’s homepage. We understood from that text that the app featured two age-based versions which were designed to be different from one another – the under-18 version supposedly not featuring any gambling content or ads whilst the over-18 version featured ads for LiveScore Bet and other gambling operators. We acknowledged Livescore Bet’s view that the majority of LiveScore app users were adults. However, we considered that because there was an option to self-verify as under-18, that version of the app should not have featured gambling ads because those ads, due to the stated target audience, would have been directed at under-18s. We therefore assessed whether the ads appeared in the under-18 version of the app. Ad (a) promoted live odds for LiveScore bet. We acknowledged LiveScore Bet’s view that ad (a) had been viewed on an Android device and that they had been unable to replicate the ad appearing within the under-18 version the app. However, we had seen the ad appear in the under-18 version. Because we had viewed the ad on that version, we considered it had appeared in a medium specifically designed for under-18s and that it had not been appropriately targeted. Ad (b) also promoted live odds for LiveScore Bet, which they acknowledged had been displayed within the under-18 version of the LiveScore app when viewed on IOS devices. Although we acknowledged LiveScore Bet’s view that the ad had been displayed in that version because of a technical problem, we considered that because it appeared in a medium specifically designed for under-18s, it had not been appropriately targeted. Whilst we accepted the ads had been seen because of a technical fault, because the ads appeared in the context of a version of an app that was directed at under-18s, they did not comply with the rules on gambling advertising. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 16.1 and 16.3.13 (Gambling).",The ads must not appear in the under-18 version of the LiveScore app again. We told LiveScore Betting & Gaming (UK) Ltd to ensure their ads were appropriately targeted.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/livescore-betting---gaming--gibraltar--ltd-a25-1274875-livescore-betting---gaming--gibraltar--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Menwell Ltd t/a Manual,,"A paid-for Google ad seen on 31 January 2025 for Manual, a men’s health treatment provider. The ad stated, “Buy Oral Minoxidil - £14/Month”. Smaller text stated, “Effective in 9/10 Men – The Very Best Treatment in the UK. Proven in Major Studies & Approved By Medical Experts. Book Your Personal Online Consultation”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it advertised a prescription-only medicine to the public.,Menwell Ltd t/a Manual said they had removed the product from their advertising.,"The CAP Code stated that prescription-only medicines or prescription-only medical treatments must not be advertised to the public. The ad was visible to the general public and stated, “Buy Oral Minoxidil […] Book Your Personal Online Consultation”. We understood from the MHRA that oral minoxidil was a prescription-only medicine and was licensed for the treatment of some types of hypertension only. We considered it was unlikely that this was the indication for which Manual were advertising the medicine to men, and as it was a prescription-only medicine it should, in any case, not have been advertised to the public. We welcomed Manual’s willingness to remove the product from their advertising. However, because the ad promoted a prescription-only medicine to the general public we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Menwell Ltd t/a Manual not to promote prescription-only medicines to the general public in future.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/menwell-ltd-a25-1277445-menwell-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on AirDoctor LLC t/a AmazingAir,"On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint which formed the subject of this ruling was received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ad and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code . Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A post on the health.detective Garstang Health Food Store’s TikTok account was seen on 27 December 2024. The video in the ad featured on-screen text that stated, “This is an impressive cough fix”. The man featured in the video and on-screen text stated, “Hands up who’s got a cough that just won’t go away? Well, here’s a little fix I hope might help you. And I’ve used this successfully with my four year old [sic] daughter who’s had a persistent cough for month after month after month that just won’t go away and we’ve done the things like checking for black mould, giving her all kinds of cough remedies, some of which do ease the symptoms, but this thing, this was amazing. We got an amazing air filter and put it in her bedroom and put it on and that very night she stopped coughing […] it starts to monitor the quality of your air […] delighted that my daughter now sleeps without that awful hacking cough and look here you can get 200 quid off it if you wanna try if for yourself or for your children […] and if you screenshot this QR code […] you’ll get 200 quid off one […] AmazingAir for those nasty nasty coughs”. Text at the bottom of the ad stated, “The AmazingAir filter really is amazing! #coughremedy #cough #airfilter #ionizer fixed my daughters cough the very night we started using it”.",,AirDoctor LLC (AirDoctor) and health.detective Garstang Health Food Store Ltd (health.detective) did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by AirDoctor’s and health.detective’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such and that they made clear their commercial intent, if that is not obvious from the context. The post featured a QR code that was an affiliate link and by following the link, consumers could purchase the AmazingAir filter. We understood that meant the health.detective account would receive a commission for any click-throughs to the product listing on the AmazingAir website. The post was therefore a marketing communication for the purposes of the Code. We then assessed whether the ad was obviously identifiable as such. We noted that the post did not feature the label “#ad”, or any similar prominent identifier. In the absence of a clear and prominent label, we therefore concluded that the post was not obviously identifiable as a marketing communication and as such breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications). The CAP Code stated that medicinal or medical claims and indications may be made for a medicinal product that is licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, Veterinary Medicines Directorate or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency, or for a CE-marked medical device and that objective claims must be backed by evidence, if relevant consisting of trials conducted on people. We considered the claims, including “This is an impressive cough fix”, “I’ve used this successfully with my four year old [sic] daughter who’s had a persistent cough for month after month after month that just won’t go away”, “We got an amazing air filter and put it in her bedroom and put it on and that very night she stopped coughing”, “fixed my daughters [sic] cough the very night we started using it” and “delighted that my daughter now sleeps without that awful hacking cough”, were likely to be understood by consumers that the product could treat and prevent coughs. We therefore considered that the ad made medical claims, which required that the product met the requirements for medical devices. We had not seen evidence that the product was registered with the MHRA, nor had we seen evidence that the AmazingAir filter had the appropriate conformity marking. Therefore, no medical claims could be made for the product. Because the ad made such claims, we concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told health.detective Garstang Health Food Store Ltd and Air Doctor LLC to ensure that in future their ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications. We further told them not to make medical claims for unlicensed products. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/airdoctor-llc-a24-1273039-airdoctor-llc.html
ASA Ruling on SemaPen Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on prescription-only medicines (POMs) used for weight loss. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Google ad for SemaPen, seen on 2 October 2024, stated, “SemaPen Weight Loss […] Clinically Designed Weight Loss Pen Program […] SemaPen Makes Weight Loss Easier.”",The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it promoted POMs to the public.,"SemaPen Ltd said they had initiated an internal review upon being made aware of the complaint. They accepted that the ad in question had not been compliant with the requirements of ASA guidance or the CAP Code. They said they had contracted with a third-party marketing agency and had not realised that the content in question had not been compliant. They said they had shared guidelines issued by the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) with the agency at the start of their relationship and had expected that all ads would meet those requirements. SemaPen accepted that they bore the responsibility for their marketing material’s overall compliance and said they had since stopped working with the third-party agency. They had ensured the new agency they were partnering with were aware of the legal and regulatory requirements around the advertising of POMs and had also re-shared MHRA guidance internally. SemaPen said that they were not affiliated with non-specialist prescribers (e.g., GPs), but that they hoped in future to work with the NHS as they grew as a business. They said their website and onboarding process made clear to all patients that not everyone was suitable for prescription-only weight-loss medication, and that patients underwent a thorough medical assessment and triage prior to any prescription being issued. SemaPen said they were happy to work with the ASA on such issues and would ensure that future marketing materials would be compliant.","The CAP Code stated that prescription-only medicines (POMs) or prescription-only medical treatments must not be advertised to the public. The ad included multiple references to the brand name “SemaPen” and the claims “Clinically Designed Weight Loss Pen Program” and “SemaPen Makes Weight Loss Easier”. The ASA considered that the reference to “Weight Loss Pen” was likely to be understood by consumers to mean injectable weight-loss medication. We noted that the landing page on SemaPen’s website which was linked to by the ad stated, “What’s included? Weight Loss Injections […] One of the first providers of weight loss jabs in the UK, we offer this ground breaking [sic] injectable treatment”, next to which was a graphic of a medical injection pen. We understood that all injectable forms of weight-loss medication were POMs. We therefore considered that the reference to “Weight Loss Pen” in the ad promoted a POM to the public. Furthermore, “SemaPen” the brand name of the product, which was referenced in the ad, was made up of a combination of the terms “Sema” and “Pen”. We considered that, in the context of an ad for a weight-loss treatment, consumers would be likely to understand the reference to “Sema” to be an abbreviated version of “semaglutide”, which was a weight-loss POM. We therefore considered that the references to “Sema” and “SemaPen” promoted a POM to the public. We sought advice from the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). They expressed concern that as weight-loss injections (“Weight Loss Pen”) were legally classified as a POM, the use of that term was likely to lead to a consumer requesting a POM. While we welcomed SemaPen’s assurances that future ads would be compliant with the requirements of the Code, for the above reasons we considered that the ad had advertised POMs to the public and concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told SemaPen Ltd not to promote POMs to the public in future.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/semapen-ltd-a24-1264772-semapen-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Yazen Health AB t/a Yazen,This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on prescription-only medicines (POMs) used for weight loss.,"An Instagram post by the TV personality Gemma Collins, @gemmacollins, posted on 6 January 2025, promoted the weight loss service Yazen. In a video, Ms Collins stated, “I'm starting this year two sizes down, thanks to Yazen’s weight loss app and medication. It's really quick and easy to get started with Yazen, it has absolutely changed my life […] I finally found something that actually I lose weight on. All you need to do is download the app and answer a few quick questions about your goals. Do not buy it from anyone but Yazen.” Ms Collins stated, “I feel healthier, I feel happier. I don't have that constant noise in my head ‘you need to eat, you need to eat’ […] Yes, there's, you know, reports and stuff. And I'm not telling anyone to go on this medication, but it is prescribed on the NHS.” Ms Collins then stated, “Yazen will connect you with one of their nurses who will […] complete some simple health checks and a blood test […] your Yazen doctor will use this to create your individual treatment plan and just like that, your medication will be delivered straight to your door with all the instructions on how you need to start your weight loss journey. It really is as simple as that.” Text in the accompanying caption stated, “Yazen was founded by doctors to support people struggling with obesity and weight-related issues. They use approved medication alongside support from their team of doctors, psychologists, dietitians, physiotherapists and your own Yazen Coach, helping their patients take control of their health […] I hope we can all embark on this journey together. It’s important to remember everyone’s weight loss journey is personal and unique and you can talk to your GP if you’re concerned! Visit @yazenUK to find out more. #Yazen #YazenHealth #weightlossjourney #healthylifestyle #loseweightnow”.",Two complainants challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it promoted POMs to the public.,"Yazen Health AB t/a Yazen said they were a Swedish-registered digital healthcare provider focused on treating weight issues and obesity through their digital platform, which had been developed by a specialist team of healthcare professionals. They said their method was built on clinically proven science, where every patient received a personal assessment and an individually adapted treatment plan. That plan included support from doctors, lifestyle coaches, dietitians, psychologists and physiotherapists. As part of the treatment, the doctor might prescribe relevant medication, which meant that Yazen was a digital healthcare provider, not a pharmacy. Doctors employed by Yazen might prescribe POMs as part of patient treatment if it was found to be the best option for that individual. The patient would then purchase the medication from a pharmacy of their choice. Yazen did not sell any medication, and said their business model was not dependent on prescribing such medication. Therefore, they said they had no interest in advertising POMs to the public. Yazen said the paid partnership Instagram post from 6 January had been intended to share information about their holistic, responsible approach to weight loss, and had not been intended to focus solely on medication. Following notification of the complaint, and in agreement with Gemma Collins, the post had since been amended to remove any reference to POMs. Yazen said they would ensure that future posts were compliant with the CAP Code. Gemma Collins said she took her responsibilities under the CAP code seriously and strove to comply with them. She said she had partnered with Yazen as she had historically struggled with her weight, despite trying many diets. She said she had used Yazen's for several months before deciding to go public with it, because she found the programme had worked for her. She said it was the holistic approach which had helped her and which she wanted to share primarily. She said she would have done that regardless of whether medication was recommended. She accepted that her posts had promoted the Yazen weight loss service and app. She said Yazen would in future approve any marketing materials she might post, and that she would follow any guidance the ASA provided.","The CAP Code stated that prescription-only medicines (POMs) or prescription-only medical treatments must not be advertised to the public. The ASA acknowledged that the ad did not make reference to a named POM. However, the ad did refer to “weight loss […] medication” and “it is prescribed on the NHS”. Ms Collins also stated, “Yes, there's […] reports and stuff. And I'm not telling anyone to go on this medication, but it is prescribed on the NHS” which we considered, given her tone, alluded to the recent press reports that people had suffered adverse reactions from taking injectable weight-loss medications. We also noted that a news section on Yazen’s website featured links to three newspaper articles about Ms Collins’ weight-loss journey. The thumbnails for those articles featured text explaining that Ms Collins had lost weight using Yazen’s “GLP-1 weight loss injections”. We understood that all injectable forms of weight-loss medication were POMs and that GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) were a class of POMs. We sought advice from the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). They expressed concern that consumers were likely to be led to request a POM. It was their view that this likelihood could be amplified by any resultant national newspaper coverage of Ms Collins’ experience of using a GLP-1 medicinal product for weight loss. We considered that the reference to “weight loss medication” in the ad was a reference to POMs and that the ad therefore promoted POMs to the public. For those reasons, we concluded the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Yazen Health AB t/a Yazen not to promote, either directly or indirectly, POMs to the public in future.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/yazen-health-ab-g25-1278617-yazen-health-ab.html
ASA Ruling on Cosmos Oyun Yazilim Sanayi Ticaret Ltd Sirketi t/a Filter AI,,"An in-game ad for an AI simulator app, seen on April 6 2025, featured an image of a man alongside text stating, “me”, next to an image of the singer Sabrina Carpenter alongside text stating, “My crush”. An AI simulated video showed the two kissing and text stated, “Kiss your CELEBRITY CRUSH”. A voiceover stated, “Just upload two photos to filter AI app and it will create a video of kissing your celebrity crush in seconds.” Further text stated, “Filter AI. No #1 AI Video Generator. Try with your own photo”.","The complainant, who believed that the ad objectified women, challenged whether it was offensive and promoted a harmful gender stereotype.",Cosmos Oyun Yazilim Sanayi Ticaret Ltd Sirketi t/a Filter AI said they did not intend for the ad to objectify women or to promote a harmful gender stereotype. They said the purpose of the ad was to promote their product in a creative and responsible manner. They said they would review their internal advertising guidelines and confirmed that the ad had been withdrawn.,"The CAP Code stated that ads must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, must not cause serious or widespread offence and must not include gender stereotypes that were likely to cause harm. The ad featured an AI simulated video in which a man and the singer Sabrina Carpenter were seen to kiss each other, alongside text which stated, “Kiss your celebrity crush”. That video was generated by uploading two images of individual people. The ASA considered that, within the context of the man being labelled “me” and the woman being labelled “My Crush”, the woman was portrayed as being a person who the man was physically attracted to. She was then seen kissing the man, which was her sole role in the ad. Because her only purpose in the ad was entirely focused on being a person for the man to kiss, which was an intimate act, we considered she was reduced to being presented as an object. We therefore considered the ad objectified women and featured a harmful gender stereotype. We also considered the phrase “Just upload two photos to filter AI app and it will create a video of kissing your celebrity crush in seconds” alongside images of women, was both harmful and offensive to women because it implied consumers should use the app to objectify them. We therefore considered the phrase, alongside a selection of images of women, reinforced the harmful impression that it was acceptable to objectify and stereotype women by presenting them as objects. For those reasons, we considered the ad objectified women by reducing them to physical objects. We therefore concluded that the ad included a harmful gender stereotype and was likely to cause serious offence. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Cosmos Oyun Yazilim Sanayi Ticaret Ltd Sirketi t/a Filter AI to ensure that future ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious offence, including by featuring a harmful gender stereotype that objectified women.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/cosmos-oyun-yazilim-sanayi-ticaret-ltd-sirketi.html
ASA Ruling on GTOHero Ltd t/a GTO Hero,"On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA).

Text stated, “AI is changing poker forever [robot emoji] Don’t get left behind. Stay ahead of the game with GTO Hero’s Real Time Assistance (RTA) [bar graph emoji] Master GTO strategy, Plug leaks, and Outplay opponents using the same technology Pros rely on . [sic] Adapt or Get Crushed!”. A video demonstrated the product in use during an online poker game with other players staking dollars, as a voiceover stated, “This app gives you real time poker solutions. It tracks your game and then tells you what to do so that you can play GTO, making money from poker has never been so easy.

Find out more at GTO hero com.” The ad linked to a website, GTOHero.com, that stated, “Please note it is against our terms of service to use GTO Hero during live play or in a way that breaks your contract or terms of service with a poker site”.","The complainant, who understood that use of the product was prohibited on poker sites, challenged whether the ad was misleading.","GTOHero Ltd t/a GTO Hero said their product was a service that could track a video feed of an online poker game and display the relevant GTO (Game Theory Optimal) solution. GTO solutions were a form of data that provided a strategy for how to play poker and allowed users to playback video or screen share to compare their play to the GTO in order to study the strategy. They said that looking at GTO solutions during live play did not constitute cheating because it was not deceptive, did not give an unfair advantage or interfere with the game’s integrity. While some poker sites had chosen to ban GTO as a matter of policy, that was a site-specific restriction rather than an inherent violation of the rules of poker. Therefore, it was possible to use GTO “live” in a way that was acceptable. For example, the user may have played on a poker site that allowed players to look up strategies and use their product, the user may not have been playing for real money or the user may have been playing in a simulated game against a computer. GTO Hero said their website homepage, which was the landing page for the ad, had a warning that stated not to use their service during live play or in a way that was not allowed by a specific poker site. They said in addition to that most of the ad showed their product being used on an uploaded video and was not live. Finally, nowhere in the ad did it say it could be used during live play without consequence if it was forbidden by a specific poker site.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so. In addition, marketing communications must state significant limitations and qualifications. Qualifications may clarify but must not contradict the claims that they qualify. We understood that GTO Hero was a poker app that allowed users to use RTA to automatically receive GTO solutions during live play. We also understood that the software showed where, from a video recording of a past game, a player had made a less optimal move and could therefore be used as a learning tool. We acknowledged GTO Hero’s comments that the ad showed their product being used on an uploaded video that was not live and we noted that it was possible to use it in a live setting in a way that was legitimate. For instance, in circumstances where users were not playing for money, where they were playing a computer opponent or on some poker sites that allowed the product. However, we firstly considered it was not clear the ad was an uploaded video. In addition, both the text in the body of the ad and the voiceover in the video stated “Real Time Assistance” or “real time poker solutions”. The video also appeared to show the app being used during a live game with other players staking real dollars around a table, while the voiceover stated, “[The software] gives you real time poker solutions. Tracks your games and tells you what to do, so that you can play GTO. Making money from poker has never been so easy.” We considered consumers were likely to understand the ad to mean that the app was for general use during real-life live events, on a range of platforms, where real funds were being staked. However, in contrast, we understood some poker sites had chosen to ban the use of GTO during live play, potentially resulting in users being banned from platforms and having funds confiscated. We acknowledged that the landing page for the ad had a warning not to use the service during live play or in a way that was not allowed by a poker site. However, we considered that warning, which was in small text and not displayed prominently, in any case misleadingly contradicted the impression of the ad. Because the ad presented the product as being used generally during live poker games to make money, whereas using the app on at least some poker sites during live play was not allowed, we concluded it was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.9 (Misleading advertising).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told GTOHero Ltd t/a GTO Hero to ensure that future ads did not misleadingly suggest the product could legitimately be used during live play on sites that prohibited the use of GTO solutions during live play.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/gtohero-ltd-a25-1275239-gtohero-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on LEBOM Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad and a paid-for X ad for LEBOM, a sports betting app, seen in April 2025: a. The Facebook ad featured a video of internet personality Mashtag Brady talking about the LEBOM app. He said, “Today we are going to be playing LEBOM. LEBOM allows you to gamble against your friends on the Premier League. All you need to do is make your predictions on all of the weekend’s games. You put some money in the pot and then the winner takes it all, baby. It’s pretty f-[censored] genius.” The video included a demonstration of how the LEBOM app worked and showed clips of Mashtag and a group of friends with alcoholic drinks. They drank shots whilst Mashtag said, “Let’s get pissed.” The video then showed clips of Mashtag and his friends in a busy bar as he said, “We also have a forfeit for whoever comes bottom in the table on LEBOM.” A member of the group was told he had won the £200 prize pot. He and his friends were shown continuing to drink alcohol to celebrate the winner. The loser was shown stripping down to his underwear and walking through the bar. Mashtag said, “So download LEBOM and get betting with your friends. Don’t bet against the bookie, bet against the boys, that’s the best way about doing it.” b. The X ad featured a similar video with the same internet personality as ad (a). He said, “So, we are going to be playing LEBOM. LEBOM allows you to gamble against your friends instead of the bookies. It’s pretty fucking genius. Let’s go get absolutely fucked up.” The video included shortened clips from ad (a) of Mashtag and his friends drinking shots, celebrating and completing a forfeit before Mashtag said, “So download LEBOM. Don’t bet against the bookie, bet against the boys”.",Two complainants challenged whether the ads:,"LEBOM Ltd believed their betting app was different from other gambling products because it provided a shared social experience similar to a pub sweepstake or fantasy football league. They highlighted that their platform offered a number of in-built safeguards, including maximum stakes and controlled game frequency. They believed their ads, which demonstrated that they utilised a peer-based model without traditional betting odds, were socially responsible. LEBOM said they worked with content creators to present their product honestly and authentically in their ads. The clips featured in the ads were taken from an unscripted long-form YouTube video produced by the internet personality Mashtag Brady for his social media audience. They stated the tone of the video parodied a drinking game which was colloquially known as ‘Soccer Saturday’, which was consistent with Mashtag Brady’s usual social media content. They believed the references to alcohol were incidental and not part of the app’s gameplay. They explained that scenes of the ‘loser’ completing a forfeit were intended to show that there was always a loser on LEBOM. They said they featured individuals losing bets in almost all of their ads to responsibly reflect the reality of gambling. They believed that because they showed the LEBOM app being used in a realistic, relatable context, the ads were responsible. They stated that, upon notification of the ASA’s investigation, they had removed all ads which featured the phrases “Let’s get pissed” and “Let’s go get absolutely fucked up”. They had also removed an ad featuring the ‘loser’ being made to order drinks in his underwear as a forfeit.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications for gambling must be socially responsible and must not suggest gambling is a way to improve self-esteem or gain recognition or admiration.CAP’s advertising guidance on responsibility and problem gambling stated that marketing communications that portrayed a character being treated with admiration by others as a result of their gambling were likely to link gambling with improved self-esteem. The ads featured clips of a friendship group cheering for the winner of the prize pot and laughing as the loser was made to strip to his underwear as a forfeit. The winner appeared to be praised by the group, in contrast to the loser, who was mocked. Whilst we acknowledged LEBOM’s intention to portray losing as part of the reality of gambling, we considered that the ads went beyond referencing the emotion associated with losing. Instead, they showed the winner being celebrated by his friends whilst the loser was made to complete an embarrassing forfeit. That created the impression that the winner, who had had the most success gambling, was someone to be admired and the loser was someone to be looked down on. We therefore considered that the ads irresponsibly linked gambling with improved recognition or self-esteem. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1, 16.3.1 and 16.3.6 (Gambling). The CAP Code also stated that marketing communications must contain nothing that was likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that were unwise. For example, they should not encourage excessive drinking. The ads featured clips of an internet personality, Mashtag Brady, and a group of friends drinking alcohol whilst using the LEBOM app. We considered that, rather than being incidental to the setting, alcohol was prominently featured in the ads. The group was shown drinking alcohol as they monitored their results on the LEBOM app, and Mashtag said the phrases “Let’s get pissed” and “Let’s go get absolutely fucked up”. It was implied that all members of the group had been drinking heavily and were intoxicated. We considered those scenes encouraged excessive drinking by presenting binge drinking alcohol in a humorous manner. We also considered those same scenes presented drinking excessive alcohol as an activity that could be combined with gambling in order to improve socialising with friends, and which trivialised the risks of gambling whilst under the influence of alcohol. We considered that by portraying and encouraging excessive drinking, including within the context of gambling, the ads were irresponsible and breached the Code. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 18.1 (Alcohol).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told LEBOM Ltd to ensure that their future ads did not portray, condone, or encourage gambling behaviour that was socially irresponsible, or encourage excessive drinking.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/lebom-ltd-g25-1288328-lebom-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Wuxi Zhan'ao E-commerce Co Ltd t/a Lpows.com,,"A paid-for YouTube ad for a laser welding tool from the website Lpows.com, seen on 28 April 2025, featured on-screen text that stated, “Smart operation, even women can weld well. The built-in laser intelligent application system makes it easy for even novice operators to operate” and an image of a woman wearing a helmet. The video showed women using the laser welding tool as a voiceover described how to use it.","The complainant, who believed the ad perpetuated a harmful gender stereotype by suggesting that women were less skilled than men at mechanical or industrial tasks, challenged whether it breached the Code.",Wuxi Zhan'ao E-commerce Co Ltd t/a Lpows.com did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Wuxi Zhan’ao E-commerce Co Ltd's lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. The CAP Code stated that advertisements must not include gender stereotypes that were likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence. The joint CAP and BCAP “Advertising guidance on depicting gender stereotypes likely to cause harm or serious or widespread offence” said that gender-stereotypical roles included occupations or positions usually associated with a specific gender, while gender-stereotypical characteristics included attributes or behaviours usually associated with a specific gender. It further stated that ads that directly contrasted male and female stereotypical roles or characteristics needed to be handled with care, and that care should be taken to avoid suggesting that stereotypical roles or characteristics were always uniquely associated with one gender and care should be taken to avoid suggesting that stereotypical roles or characteristics were never carried out or displayed by another gender. The ad featured on-screen text that stated, “Smart operation, even women can weld well. The built-in laser intelligent application system makes it easy for even novice operators to operate”. We considered that the statement “even women can weld well” implied that women were less skilled than men at performing mechanical tasks and that the laser welding tool was so easy to use, even women would be able to use it. We considered that statement, which was immediately followed by, “makes it easy for even novice operators to operate” was likely also to be understood to mean that women were novices at using mechanical tools. We concluded that the ad included a gender stereotype that was likely to cause harm or serious offence and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained about.

ASA Ruling on HOMA Games SAS,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An in-game ad for the mobile game app Tape Thrower, seen in the Belt It mobile app, on 29 March 2025. In low-detail, cartoon style animation, the ad featured a woman wearing only red heels and a facemask, standing on a catwalk with her hands on her hips. Her breasts and midsection were obscured by pixelation, although her belly button and the shape of her breasts were still visible. The tape thrower was directed towards her. Text in the caption below stated, “Tape Thrower” followed by “Throw and hit with duct tape!”.","The complainant, who believed the image was overly sexualised and objectified women, challenged whether the ad:","Homa Games SAS t/a Homa Games said that the ad was for Tape Thrower, which had a PEGI 3 rating on Google Play and a 4+ rating on the Apple App Store. The game was designed in a light-hearted, comedic style inspired by the ""prank"" genre and was not intended to offend or reinforce gender stereotypes. The ad was placed through third-party advertising platforms, which managed its distribution, including its appearance within the Belt It app. They acknowledged the concerns and paused the campaign in the UK. They said that they were reviewing internal processes to ensure better ad compliance.","The ad, which was for the 'Tape Thrower' game and depicted various scenarios, including one where the players could throw duct tape to hit and cover a woman’s body, featured a nude woman whose face was obscured by a facemask, with pixelation obscuring her midsection and breasts. We considered she was therefore depicted in a manner that was sexually suggestive and made her body the central focus of the ad. The ad also presented her as a passive target in the game. We considered that the ad objectified and stereotyped the woman by presenting her as a passive, sexual object with the sole purpose of titillating viewers. We concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious offence and included a gender stereotype in a way that was likely to cause harm. We understood the game was seen in the Belt It mobile app, a puzzle game which had an age rating of 4+ years and therefore could be downloaded by children. We considered that those playing an unrelated game would not expect to be served an ad which featured a naked woman, and considered the ad had been irresponsibly targeted. Notwithstanding that, because we considered that this specific ad was likely to cause serious offence and included a gender stereotype in a way that was likely to cause harm, it was not suitable to be featured in any game. We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code.The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in its current form.

ASA Ruling on Honeytech Ltd t/a Honeytoon,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Two paid-for X (formally Twitter) ads for HoneyToons, a webcomic platform: a. The first ad, seen on 22 March 2025, featured the caption “[joker emoji] A harmless joke…or a path to unexpected consequences? When a simple prank spirals out of control, tension rises, and desires awaken. [Smirking emoji] What happens when boundaries are pushed too far? Find out in Prank Goes Wrong — where mischief turns into something much more intense… [fire emoji] [ devil emoji]”. An anime/manga-style image underneath, presented in a comic book layout, depicted a young woman and a man wrestling. She had him in a headlock, with her legs wrapped around his waist. A speech bubble read “BRO, I’M DONE WITH YOUR PRANKS!”. The following panel showed the same woman with an angry expression, accompanied by text that read “OMG!”, and “YO, IS THAT A THIRD LEG?”. A final image, in which she looked surprised, featured the text “OMG! BUT I’M YOUR SISTER!”. Underneath the image, text stated, “Hot comics, follow now! [fire emoji]”, with a hyperlink to honeytoon.com. b. The second ad, seen on 29 March 2025, featured the caption “[fire emoji] A honeymoon like no other…a desire too forbidden to resist.

The scene portrayed in the next image was of the man smiling and standing behind the woman while she appeared shocked.

We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The text in the caption, speech bubbles, and imagery in ad (a) portrayed a man becoming sexually aroused as a woman wrestled with him. The scene depicted the woman being placed in a sexual situation without consent, before revealing that they were brother and sister. In ad (b), the text in the caption, speech bubbles, and imagery depicted a man sexually assaulting his mother-in-law. Both ads featured sexually explicit content, which we considered was likely to cause serious and widespread offence in the context of an untargeted paid ad on X. Furthermore, the sexual situations depicted were non-consensual, with ad (b) unambiguously depicting sexual violence against a woman. Additionally, the portrayal of the women as a sister and mother-in-law to the men played on pornographic tropes relating to the taboos of incest and sexual relationships with other family members. We considered those aspects of the ads’ content were also likely to cause serious and widespread offence. We additionally considered both ads objectified and stereotyped women by presenting them as objects of sexual gratification and therefore included a gender stereotype that was likely to cause harm. For those reasons we considered the ads were not suitable to be featured in any medium. While we acknowledged the ads were for a webcomic platform featuring adult themes and sexually suggestive and explicit content, we considered the advertiser must ensure that their ads did not feature content which was likely to cause offence or harm.

ASA Ruling on Koi Footwear Ltd,,"An email from Koi Footwear, received on 2 April 2025 featured the subject heading “Take two and call us in the morning [pill emoji] [pill emoji]”. The body of the email included a photo of a syringe and a vial containing pink liquid. The vial included text on the side which stated, “KOI”. Text above the image stated, “// SIDE EFFECTS: MAY INCLUDE OBSESSION.” Underneath that, product images of Koi shoes were featured.","The complainant, who believed the ad glamourised drug use, challenged whether the ad was offensive and irresponsible because it encouraged or condoned drug use.","Koi Footwear Ltd stated that the ad was inspired by Japanese subcultures, biotech aesthetics, and video game references, in particular, the Silent Hill franchise. They said the imagery and text used, including pills and syringes, were intended to symbolise transformation and synthetic enhancement, but that the campaign was intended to be surreal and tongue-in-cheek, and was not intended to reference real drug use or glamorise substance abuse. They said phrases such as “Take two and call us in the morning” and “// SIDE EFFECTS: MAY INCLUDE OBSESSION” were intended to fit within that fictional context, but not to promote irresponsible behaviour. They said that they did not support, encourage, or glamorise drug use in any form, and they fully understood the importance of avoiding messaging that could be seen as promoting such behaviour. In light of this, they were reviewing how these particular creative elements may have been interpreted and were open to making amendments or adding contextual disclaimers in future campaigns to avoid misunderstanding.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, and that ads must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. The ASA considered that the subject line of the email “Take two and call us in the morning” including the pill emojis, referenced medical dosage instructions in a way that would be familiar to consumers. We further considered that the visual presentation of the syringe and the pink liquid in the branded “Koi” vial in the body of the email closely resembled drug paraphernalia and, alongside the wording “// SIDE EFFECTS: MAY INCLUDE OBSESSION”, directly linked Koi’s products to drug culture and use. We noted Koi Footwear’s explanation that the ad was intended to be surreal and fictional, however, we considered that recipients of the email would interpret the syringe and language literally, as drug related. We considered that the depiction of the branded syringe, alongside a phrase mimicking medical advice, and a reference to its side effects including “OBSESSION”, trivialised drug use and glamorised the idea of addictive behaviour as an appealing or stylish trait. In that context, we concluded that the ad condoned and encouraged drug use, and was therefore irresponsible, and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.1 (Harm and offence).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on LC International Ltd t/a Ladbrokes,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld","A TV ad and a Video on Demand (VOD) ad for Ladbrokes: a. The TV ad, seen on 17 December 2024, featured a voice-over that stated, “This is a Ladbuck, the new way to get rewarded at Ladbrokes, and these are some of the 100 million Ladbucks that will be dropping weekly. Collect them on our free to play games and choose rewards like free spins, free bets and more. Over 100 million Ladbucks dropping every single week. Plus you can even use them to play your favourite games for free in our Ladbucks arcade. Like Fishin Frenzy and Goldstrike. Start collecting at Ladbrokes.com.” The ad featured imagery of coins that displayed the initials ‘Lb’, as well as text that stated “100m LADBUCKS”, FREE BETS” and “FREE SPINS”. b. The VOD ad, seen on Channel 4 on Demand on 23 December 2024, was the same as ad (a).","Two complainants who believed the term ‘Ladbucks’ was likely to be of strong appeal to those under 18 years of age, challenged whether:","1 & 2. LC International Ltd t/a Ladbrokes said both ads promoted ‘Ladbucks’, which was their rewards programme. Ladbucks were tokens, depicted as coins, that consumers collected for free by participating in selected promotions, which were then used to redeem offers within the ‘Ladbucks Store’ or the ‘Ladbucks arcade’. They could only be used by logged-in, verified over-18 consumers. They stated tokens could not be purchased, had no monetary value and expired if not used. They explained that Ladbucks did not have a general market value with an exchange rate, and they could not be universally used across all products on the Ladbrokes site. They said each eligible product or offer had a set value, which was in contrast to in-game currency products. Ladbrokes said that, in the context of their rewards programme, the term Ladbucks was chosen as a play on the word Ladbrokes, and because it referenced, through the use of the term bucks, that it had value on the Ladbrokes website. They believed the term ‘bucks’ was known as a colloquialism for dollars and was widely used to refer to money or a unit of currency in many contexts, which included video games. They said that the word had no origins in youth culture and believed that it was not of inherent strong appeal to under-18s. They highlighted that both ads had targeting restrictions to reduce the likelihood of children viewing them. Ladbrokes believed that the term was not associated with any coins from videogames which were popular with under-18s. They said that ‘V-bucks’ from Fortnite and ‘Robux’ from Roblox were in-game currencies that had to be purchased before being used to buy in-game items. They also said that certain elements of Robux required parental consent and, for subscription services, the purchaser must be over 18. Therefore, the only similarity between those coins and Ladbucks coins was the term bucks. They had reviewed the rewards programme in its entirety and believed there was no risk of the term being associated with Fortnite or Roblox. Ladbrokes said many other industries used reward schemes for consumers and the concept was not unique to video games which were popular with under-18s. They also said that as a licensed gambling operator that offered casino and poker products, using imagery of a ‘poker chip’ should not be considered imagery that was of strong appeal to under-18s. Therefore, they believed there was nothing in the imagery or the content of the ads that shared similarities with either of those games. They did not believe the term “lad” referred to a boy or young man and said their brand had never been used in that context. They also said the term “lad” itself was not specifically mentioned by the complainants. Clearcast did not believe the term Ladbucks in ad (a) appealed strongly to children. They understood that the coin was Ladbrokes’ version of free prize tokens within their rewards programme, and that they could have been used on certain promotional offers until they expired. They did not believe the tokens were similar to in-game currencies, in which those tokens had to be purchased. Channel 4 believed ad (b), which was broadcast on their streaming service, was compliant with the Code.","The BCAP and CAP Code stated that gambling ads must not be likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture. Because the ads had appeared in mediums where under-18s could not be entirely excluded from the audience, they needed to comply with that rule. BCAP and CAP guidance, “Gambling and lotteries advertising: protecting under-18s”, stated that marketers should exercise particular caution when depicting product features similar to recognisable video games, online games popular among under-18s, or common features of such games in general. It also stated that content linked to activities that were very popular or common among younger people (in terms of their direct participation and viewing) was at risk of being of strong appeal to under-18s. The ASA first assessed if there were online games which featured tokens depicted as coins, and whether they were very popular with children and strongly associated with youth culture, before considering if features of those coins had noticeable parallels with a Ladbuck. We understood that several online games popular with under-18s, such as Roblox and Fortnite, had their own in-game currencies, which were called Robux and V-bucks respectively. Those currencies, which could be both purchased and earnt through gameplay, were depicted as coins, and spent within in-game stores, usually on cosmetic items that enhanced gameplay. According to Ofcom’s 2024 report into media use and attitudes, 60% of children aged between 3 and 17 years gamed online, whilst 89% of 11–18-year-olds gamed online weekly. Overall, categories of games that were most popular included building games, such as Roblox, followed by games played against others, such as Fortnite. We also understood that many under-18s engaged with content related to both those games via YouTube, Twitch and TikTok. Data from the Academy of Animated Arts showed Fortnite had the most combined YouTube and Twitch weekly viewing hours of any game. Roblox had over 32 million daily active users under the age of 13 at the end of 2024. In addition, 24% of children aged 10–12 years played Roblox in the UK. Based on that data, we considered a significant number of under-18s were likely to be familiar with those games and their specific features, which included reward schemes that involved earning and using coins in associated game stores. For those reasons, we considered both games and their associated features were strongly associated with youth culture. Given that context, we assessed whether the term Ladbucks, through its name and in conjunction with how the coin was depicted in the ads, was likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s due to its similarities to those in-game currencies. We first assessed the similarities between the names of the coins. We considered the term Ladbucks, through the suffix ‘bucks’, had strong similarities to the in-game currencies Robux and V-bucks. We acknowledged Ladbrokes’ view that the term bucks was a well-known colloquialism for dollars and we did not consider the use of the word bucks in isolation to be of strong appeal. However, we also understood the term V-buck was a shortened version of ‘Vindertech’ buck, which was a fictional company in Fortnite. Similarly, we considered the word ‘lad’ had been taken from the company name Ladbrokes to create the name of their token. Therefore, we considered the construction of the token names, enhanced the similarity between the names of the coins, which due to the popularity of those games with children, many under-18s were likely to recognise. In addition, whilst we accepted the use of the prefix ‘lad’ was for its link to the brand, and we did not consider the brand’s name itself to be of appeal to children, we also considered that ‘lad’ was a colloquial term for a boy or young man. In the context of the ad and its use alongside the word buck, the word lad would have also been recognised and of appeal to some under-18s. We next assessed the overall depiction of the tokens. The style of both the Ladbuck and V-Buck had similarities with a poker chip. The Ladbuck token’s design was round, shiny around the edges with an initial in its centre. Those were features that were all present in the design of a V-buck. Whilst a ‘Robux’ was at the time the ads were seen, a different shape, we understood it was still sometimes depicted in its previous form, which again resembled a poker chip with the initial ‘R’ and a dollar sign in the middle. Although we acknowledged that Ladbrokes offered poker and casino games, we considered it was not the use of poker chip imagery in isolation, but the use of the token’s imagery when used in conjunction with the term Ladbucks, that was likely to have been recognisable and perceived by many under-18s as similar to those in-game currencies of online games that were of strong appeal to under-18s. In addition, we noted the Ladbucks tokens could be used in the online Ladbrokes store and arcade and that was likely to be reminiscent of the way in-game currencies Robux and V-bucks were used. Therefore, we considered that was likely to further enhance its appeal to children through its resemblance to tokens used in gaming, with which they would likely be familiar. For those reasons we concluded the name Ladbucks, when considered alongside the imagery and the application of the coin in the ads, was depicted in a manner which was similar to features in video games popular with children. We therefore considered the term in the ads was likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s and breached the Code. On those points, ad (a) breached BCAP Code rules 17.4.5 (Gambling) and ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1 and 16.3.12 (Gambling).",The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told LC International t/a Ladbrokes not to include content in ads that was reflective of youth culture or which had strong appeal to those under 18 years of age.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/lc-international-ltd-g25-1274110-lc-international-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Mars Wrigley Confectionery UK Ltd,,"A TV and VOD ad seen in March 2025: a. The TV ad showed a man driving a car, being followed by a second car. The man sped up, put the hand brake on, swerved to the right-hand side of the road and broke through a metal barrier, leaving the road in a cloud of dust. The man was then shown inside the car falling down a rocky hill. The second car stopped at the point where the first car left the road, with the broken barrier and dust still visible. The first car was then shown upside down but placed on top of an identical car at the bottom of the hill. The same man was in both cars, one upside down, the second upright. The man in the car below looked up through the sunroof at the man above. As the first man grasped the gear stick, a second hand was shown from above placing it on his hand. The car was then put in gear and drove off with the second car attached above it. Both cars, attached, drove along a road with on-screen text that said, “TWO IS MORE THAN ONE TWIX”. b. The VOD ad included the same content as ad (a).",Five complainants believed that ads (a) and (b) encouraged dangerous driving and were irresponsible.,"Mars Wrigley Confectionery UK Ltd (Mars Wrigley) said the ad had a cinematic presentation and was set in a separate world that was absurd, fantastical and removed from reality. They explained the ad was split into two parts. The first part had a good versus bad theme, reminiscent of classic films. The cars were shot driving at lawful speeds and any emulation would only reflect the legal and safe driving presented. They said they had removed identifiers of the real world from the road scenes, including vehicles, pedestrians, or road signage, to distance the setting from reality. The second part of the ad, a dual car performing a stunt that defied physics, depicted a scenario that was clearly exaggerated and not possible in reality. The surreal moment highlighted that the scene was clearly fictional and tongue in cheek. That was further emphasised by scenes of two hands operating a gear shift, a hand break turn that was not possible in real life and the man shown calmly driving off a cliff. They made sure the action was clearly in a fantasy world and would be impossible to recreate. They said Twix was further known for its playful and absurd tone and the humour in the ad reflected that and aligned with the slogan ‘Two is More Than One’. That slogan also featured at the end of the ad and reinforced the irreverent humour of the ad. The slogan when taken literally was inherently comical and aligned with the fantastical tone of the rest of the ad. Clearcast stated that the ad’s fantastical and cinematic presentation made it clear the driving was exaggerated and not intended to be emulated. It therefore did not encourage people to breach the Highway Code or suggest safe driving was boring. It used imaginative storytelling, using absurd elements and a Hollywood style, to project the message that ""Two is More Than One"" and did so in a way that was unlikely to be understood as showing reasonable driving practices.","The CAP and BCAP Codes stated that ads must not condone or encourage irresponsible driving or a breach of the legal requirements of the Highway Code. The man driving the first car was shown smiling as his car fell down a hill, only for it to be seen again with an identical car on top of it. A second man was in that car and reached through the sunroof to place his hand on the first man’s hand. Both cars were shown driving off, one on top of the other. The ASA therefore acknowledged that the ad contained some clearly fantastical elements in the latter part of the ad and had a cinematic feel overall. However, at the start of the ad the driver was shown on an ordinary road, when a car approached behind him. We considered the road was clearly realistic, albeit in an isolated and exotic location, with lane dividers visible and both cars ensuring they stayed on one side of the road, replicating real life. The second car then appeared to be approaching the initial car rapidly and the engine sound was audible. On noticing the car, the first man was shown immediately putting his car in gear, with a determined expression on his face, and appeared to be speeding up to evade the car. The feeling of speed was emphasised by the fast paced beat and music. Therefore, the scenes were depicted as a chase with the emphasis on speed. In addition, the first man was then shown putting the handbrake on and the car swerved off the road leaving visible skid marks. We considered the emphasis on a chase, and the speed inherent to that, and the driving manoeuvres featured would be dangerous and irresponsible if emulated in real life on a public highway. Because we considered the driving depicted in the ads condoned unsafe driving, that appeared likely to breach the legal requirements of the Highway Code, we concluded the ads were irresponsible. Ad (a) breached BCAP Code rules 20.1 and 20.2 (Motoring) and ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 19.2 and 19.3 (Motoring).",The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Mars Wrigley Confectionery UK Ltd not to condone or encourage irresponsible driving that was likely to breach the legal requirements of the Highway Code in their ads.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/mars-wrigley-confectionery-uk-ltd-g25-1285557-mars-wrigley-confectionery-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Turner Lewis Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A TikTok post and a website for Turner Lewis, seen in November 2024: a. A post on the Turner Lewis TikTok account featured a video of a young woman talking about the Government Child Trust Fund scheme. She said, “If you were born after September 2002, and you’re over 18, then there’s a good chance that you’ve got some money waiting for you in the Child Trust Fund, courtesy of the British Government […] if you haven’t claimed yet then don’t worry, because we’ve got your back. Just click the link below to begin your process of locating your Child Trust Fund and, guess what? It’s a no-win, no-fee basis, meaning you’ve got nothing to lose...” A link in Turner Lewis’s TikTok profile led to a landing page. Headline text stated “Ready To Find Your Child Trust Fund? Let’s Get Started!”. Text below featured several boxes which requested personal information. A tick-box near the bottom stated “I confirm and acknowledge that I have read, understood, and agree to the Terms and Conditions of Turner Lewis. I authorise Turner Lewis to act on my behalf to locate my Child Trust Fund and provide the necessary support to access it”. Under that was a box for a signature. b. The website www.turnerlewis.co.uk, included text on the home page which stated “Find Your Child Trust Fund With Turner Lewis […] we offer expert services to help you locate your Child Trust Fund on a no win, no fee basis. Our fee is 25% plus VAT of the total amount in the account”. Smaller text directly below stated “Please be aware that you also have the option to locate your Child Trust Fund for free directly through HMRC. However, our dedicated team has successfully assisted thousands of clients, providing a comprehensive walkthrough, results and peace of mind”. Text further down the page stated “We Achieve Incredible Results For Our Clients […] Turner Lewis specialises in locating Child Trust Funds, we are experts in the regulations and processes associated with such services”. An embedded video repeated claims made on the home page. It also stated “Let us take the hassle out of the process for you. Simply submit your details on our website and we’ll handle the rest […] We reach out to 55 providers, leaving no stone unturned in our quest to locate your fund. While we wait for their replies, you can sit back and relax […] Schedule a 45-minute consultation with us, where we’ll guide you through accessing and withdrawing your funds. This session also helps us gather evidence to adjust our invoice accurately”.",,"1. Turner Lewis Ltd said that the term “you’ve got nothing to lose” was intended to highlight that their service was offered on a “no win, no fee” basis. If they did not locate a client’s Child Trust Fund (CTF), no charge would be levied, so clients would be no worse off than if they hadn’t engaged their services. They thought that prospective clients would understand from the outset that if funds were located, a fee would be charged. They believed that consumers would reasonably understand that they would have to pay a fee for their services. They thought that, while unlikely, if a consumer hadn’t understood from the ad that a fee would be charged for the successful location of a CTF once they had engaged with their website and/or staff, they would have been made aware of the potential fees involved before they had any contractual liability. 2. Turner Lewis believed the ads did not imply that their service would be free. They said ad (a) specifically stated that their service was provided on a “no win, no fee” basis, which they thought made clear that a fee was involved. They accepted that the ad did not specify the terms of the fee, but said they were comprehensively explained in the full terms and conditions, which clients received and were required to sign before engaging their services. Clients needed to tick a box confirming that they had read the terms and conditions before they signed. They rejected the suggestion that the ads portrayed them as a claims management company or that consumers would view them as one. They believed their CTF location service was needed due to what they saw as the failure of HMRC and other providers to provide consumers with an effective, successful way of locating CTFs. Turner Lewis said they were open and transparent about their services, through their ads, website, and terms and conditions. They said they ensured all prospective clients were fully informed about the work they carried out and what they were agreeing to before deciding to use their services. They did not believe their ads presented the process of locating a CTF as more complicated than it actually was, or that consumers would be misled as to the nature of their business model. They believed they were justified in suggesting that it could be easier to locate a CTF using their service because they had built up expertise and relationships with providers, which they said helped them to locate funds faster and more efficiently. They said their website made it clear that consumers could locate a CTF for free using the HMRC tool. They rejected the suggestion that any of the claims or terms highlighted in the complaint would actively deter consumers from exploring their options. 3. Turner Lewis believed that cancellation fees and a 14-day cooling off period were standard terms present in many contracts. They thought they were such common aspects of contracts that consumers would expect that fees would apply in the event of a cancellation outside of the cooling-off period, even if it had not been explicitly referenced in the ads. They also said that the cooling-off period and cancellation fees had been fully explained in the full terms and conditions of their service. Although Turner Lewis accepted that neither ad had made clear upfront that clients would be subject to cancellation fees or a cooling-off period with limitations, they felt that prospective clients had no liability for the cancellation fee until they had read and signed the terms and conditions.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead by omitting material information, hiding it, or presenting it in an untimely manner. The video in ad (a) featured a woman talking about the Government’s CTF scheme. The woman encouraged viewers to “click the link below to begin your process of locating your Child Trust Fund” and included the claim “It’s a no-win, no-fee basis, meaning you’ve got nothing to lose”. The ASA considered that consumers would likely understand from the statement “you’ve got nothing to lose” that there would be no financial impact from using Turner Lewis’s service to locate a CTF. We acknowledged Turner Lewis’s view that the term “you’ve got nothing to lose” intended to highlight that their service was offered on a “no win, no fee” basis, and that people who further engaged with their website or staff would have been made aware of the potential fees they would be charged if Turner Lewis successfully located their CTF. However, we noted that the ad, and the subsequent landing page to which it linked, contained no information regarding the fees Turner Lewis charged if a fund was located, which was 25% plus VAT of the total amount in any account located, capped at £420. While the term “no win, no fee” was likely to be understood to relate to financial services in which a potential charge was dependent on a particular outcome, it was not clear from the ad or the landing page how much any fee might be, how it would be applied, or if it would apply in all circumstances in which a CTF was located. We considered that those factors were material pieces of information a consumer would need to be aware of when deciding whether to engage Turner Lewis’s services. We also noted that neither the ad nor the subsequent landing page included any information informing consumers that there was a free route to trace a CTF via the HMRC website, which we considered was material information which would have had a bearing on someone’s decision to use Turner Lewis’s service. In that context, we considered the phrase “you’ve got nothing to lose” further mislead consumers about the alternative option available to them to trace a CTF for free. Because neither the ad nor the landing page included information about the fees consumers would incur from using Turner Lewis’s services, or the option to trace a CTF for free via the HMRC website, we considered that the ad had misleadingly omitted material information. We therefore concluded that the ad, which included the landing page to which it linked, breached the Code. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising). The CAP Code required that offers of financial products be set out in a way that allowed them to be understood easily by the audience being addressed, and that they must not take advantage of consumers’ inexperience or credulity. We understood that CTFs were long-term tax-free savings accounts for children born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011. At the time of the complaint, the oldest people who may have had a CTF in their name would have been 22 years old. We therefore considered that the target audience for the ads would, by their nature, likely be younger people who were inexperienced with financial products and offerings. Given that context, we considered it was important for the ads to make the nature of Turner Lewis’s service explicitly clear. Ad (a) included the claim “no win, no fee”, while text in ad (b) stated “locate your Child Trust Fund on a no win, no fee basis”. Ad (b) included the claim that Turner Lewis specialised in locating CTFs and stated that “we are experts in the regulations and processes associated with such services”. The embedded video seen in ad (b) also included the claims “Let us take the hassle out of the process for you” and “we reach out to 55 providers, leaving no stone unturned in our quest to locate your fund”. It also made reference to a “45-minute consultation” session, which the ad claimed helped Turner Lewis “gather evidence to adjust our invoice accurately”. Ad (b) stated that Turner Lewis were experts who specialised in CTFs, from which we considered consumers would understand that the process required specialist knowledge or understanding. The embedded video in ad (b) reinforced that impression, by alluding to the “hassle” associated with the process, and talking about “leaving no stone unturned” in a “quest” to locate a consumer’s CTF. We considered the implied necessity for a “45-minute consultation”, which consumers were likely to view as a long and detailed meeting, further added to that impression. We considered that consumers would likely understand from the presentation of both ads, and the use of language such as “no win, no fee”, that Turner Lewis operated in a similar manner to a claims management service, and that the process of locating and claiming a CTF was a potentially complicated procedure. We understood, however, that consumers could easily locate a CTF themselves for free by submitting a subject access request to HMRC via their website, to identify the account provider of the CTF. We noted that neither ad (a), nor the landing page to which it linked, made any mention of the free route available to consumers to trace a CTF. Ad (b) included smaller text under the main headline text of the page which advised consumers of the free route. That was followed, however, by further text which stated that Turner Lewis’s team had helped thousands of clients, and that their services provided “peace of mind”. We considered this further contributed to the impression that locating a CTF was a complicated process, and that using Turner Lewis’s services was a quicker and more convenient alternative. However, we had seen no evidence that Turner Lewis followed any different processes from those that a consumer would follow themselves, i.e., contacting HMRC via their website. Overall, we considered that both ads created the impression that Turner Lewis operated in similar fashion to a claims management service, when in fact they followed existing, freely available routes to trace a CTF. For the above reasons we concluded that the ads deterred consumers from using the free HMRC tool to locate a CTF and misled consumers about the nature of Turner Lewis’s business model. We also considered that the age range of people eligible for a CTF meant that the ads took advantage of consumers’ inexperience and credulity by suggesting that the process was more complicated than it was, and that engaging Turner Lewis offered advantages over the free route, when that was not the case. For those reasons, we concluded that the ads had breached the Code. On that point, both ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 14.1 (Financial products). The CAP Code stated that when making claims in their advertising, marketers should state any significant limitations or qualifications and must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information. The ads stated that consumers had “nothing to lose”, and that Turner Lewis’s CTF location service operated on a “no win, no fee” basis. The full T&Cs found on another page of their website, however, stated that a cancellation fee of £150 plus VAT may apply if consumers cancelled the service after the cooling-off period during which they could request a refund had ended, or if they breached the client responsibilities as outlined in the T&Cs. The T&Cs also stated that consumers had a 14-day cooling-off period, but that it did not apply if the service had been fully completed within that period. While we acknowledged that the full T&Cs of the service included information about both the cooling-off period and the cancellation fees, neither ad contained any information about those terms. We also noted from Turner Lewis’s response that while the length of time it took for them to complete their location service varied, approximately a third of successful cases had taken less than 14 days to complete, and that CTFs could sometimes be located within 24 hours. We therefore considered that a significant number of cases would see a CTF being located and Turner Lewis’s service being completed well before the cooling-off period had elapsed, meaning that consumers who might have wished to cancel the service within the cooling-off period would have been unable to do so in such circumstances. We considered that the cancellation fee and the cooling-off period, including the information that it would not apply if the service had been completed, were significant qualifications that consumers considering using Turner Lewis’s service should have been made aware of upfront. We therefore considered that both ads had failed to state significant qualifications to Turner Lewis’s service and had misleadingly omitted material information. Both ads therefore breached the Code. On that point, both ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 3.9 (Qualification).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Turner Lewis Ltd to ensure that their future ads did not mislead consumers about the nature of their business, omit material information, or take advantage of consumers’ inexperience and credulity. We also told them to ensure that any significant qualifications were made clear to consumers upfront.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/turner-lewis-ltd-a24-1270072-turner-lewis-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on UAB Convenity t/a Huusk,,"A TV ad for Huusk, a brand of Japanese kitchen knives, was seen on the Sky Cinema Animation channel on 17 February 2025. The ad began with several close-up shots of a knife being used to chop food and slice fruit in half. Similar close-up shots of food being cut was seen throughout the ad, which was three minutes long. A man wearing a bandana around his wrist was seen spinning the knife in his hand. In a later scene, the same man was seen holding the knife which he moved through the air in a slashing motion. He was also seen throwing and slicing a pepper while it was in the air. Another scene showed the knife being used outside in a camping environment to cut sticks before it was stuck into a tree branch. Towards the end of the ad, the knife appeared to be pushed forcibly into a tree trunk. A voiceover, which was heard throughout the ad, stated, “A blend of science, art and tradition. With a design inspired by Japanese knife masters, each Huusk knife embodies more than just a tool. It’s a testament to individuality [...] amazingly sharp and ergonomically designed […] effortlessly slicing food with ease and razor-sharp precision. Huusk cuts through ingredients like a laser […] a knife that’s more than a tool, it’s a legacy for the future.” The ad was cleared by Clearcast without an age-related scheduling restriction.","The complainant, who understood the ad had been shown immediately after a ‘U’ rated animated film, challenged whether the knife was irresponsibly depicted at a time when children would have likely been watching.","UAB Convenity t/a Huusk stated that the purpose of the ad was to highlight the features of the knife, with the kitchen and camping scenes demonstrating its strength, sharpness and versatility. Huusk believed the various scenes which showed the knife being used on food were responsible and that children would have regularly seen food being chopped and sliced at home. They said the knife was not intended to be portrayed in a manner which encouraged violent or irresponsible behaviour and believed none of the scenes featured content which appealed to children. Although they considered the content of the ad to be responsible, Huusk acknowledged that it should not have been broadcast immediately after a film which was likely to have been viewed by a high number of children. They explained that they held that view because the product was not intended to appeal to children, which they said meant that the ad’s scheduling should have been more carefully considered. Huusk acknowledged they were responsible for the selection of time slots and TV channels where the ad was broadcast. However, they believed they did not have control over the finalised scheduling of the ad. More specifically, they said the ability to prevent the ad being broadcast immediately following a children’s film was out of their control. They confirmed that no age-related scheduling restriction was issued by Clearcast and said they would ensure all future ads depicted the knife in a safe and responsible manner. Clearcast said the purpose of the ad was to showcase the product’s quality, its ease of use and the versatility of how it could be used in a variety of settings. However, they acknowledged some of the scenes could have appealed to children and believed they could have undermined the efforts of parents and schools to educate young people about the dangers of knives. They said they did not anticipate that Huusk would have wanted to schedule the ad after a film which children were likely to have been watching, but that they would consider adding a scheduling restriction so that it could not be broadcast around programmes principally directed at or likely to appeal to children. Sky said they relied on Clearcast signalling an ad’s appropriateness through use of their restrictions. They said that because the ad was not given an age-related scheduling restriction, it was scheduled accordingly, and they had no reason to suspect there was an issue with its content. They said that if Clearcast had believed that the product was unsuitable for broadcast around a film that children were likely to have been watching, then they would have expected an ex-kids restriction to have been applied.","The BCAP Code stated that relevant timing restrictions must be applied to ads that, through their content, might harm or distress children of particular ages or that are otherwise unsuitable for them. The ad was cleared without an age-related scheduling restriction that would have prevented it from being broadcast in or around programmes made for, or specifically targeted at, children (an ex-kids restriction). Consequently, it was broadcast immediately after the U rated film ‘Hotel Transylvania Two’, which meant the ad was shown at a time when children would have likely been watching. We acknowledged that because the purpose of the ad was to promote the Huusk kitchen knife, it was understandable that it would feature the product being used to showcase its performance and versatility. However, since the ad was not targeted away from children, we considered that it should not have featured imagery and dialogue that depicted the knife in a way which risked children emulating its use, in a way that would be unsafe. We considered that the ad featured a number of scenes of the knife being handled in a manner which went beyond the safe and typical use of a kitchen knife. That included a scene where a man, who had a bandana on his wrist, put his finger through a hole in the knife before he spun it on his hand. The following scene showed fruit being cut almost perfectly in half in one quick and instantaneous slicing motion. In a later scene, the man moved the knife through the air in a slashing motion which we considered was reminiscent of how ninjas were often depicted in children’s media. The man then threw an item of food in the air, and in another sudden, slicing motion, cut the food in half while it was still airborne. We considered that those scenes went beyond the safe and typical use of a kitchen knife, and if emulated by children, could have resulted in them being harmed. Throughout those scenes, the man was presented as performing complex skills which we considered children would have understood as being similar to a ninja and that those scenes would have also appealed to them. We considered, particularly in light of the appeal to children, some children may seek to emulate the scenes in the ad, thereby placing themselves at risk of harm. Another scene showed the knife being forcibly stuck into tree branches, which went beyond the typical and safe use of a kitchen knife, in a way that could seem exciting to children. We considered that scene could have caused them to emulate such behaviour and result in them being harmed. We considered that describing a knife as a ‘laser’, while also showing it spinning on someone’s hand and slicing food, presented the product as having exaggerated toy-like qualities which would have resonated with children and, again, could have resulted in harmful emulation. We considered adults would have understood that those scenes featured the knife being used in an unrealistic setting and that it would have been unsafe for someone who was not professionally trained in handling knives to emulate. In contrast, we considered some children were likely to have been excited by the knife’s depiction in the scenes, which could cause them to emulate the behaviour shown, putting them at risk of harm. We concluded that, to minimise the risk of children seeing it, the ad should have been given an ex-kids timing restriction. We therefore concluded that the scheduling of the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 1.2 (Social responsibility), 5.2 (Children), 32.1 and 32.3 (Scheduling).","The ad must not be broadcast again in its current form without an appropriate scheduling restriction to ensure it is not broadcast in or around programmes made for, or specifically targeted at, children.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/uab-convenity-a25-1281612-uab-convenity.html
ASA Ruling on Viva Research Ltd t/a Vivanmn,"Summary of Council decision: Four issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","Two paid-for Facebook ads for Vivanmn, a supplement company, seen in February and March 2025: a. The first ad stated, “Low energy, poor focus or restless nights? Just one NMN capsule a day helps you recharge, refocus, and enjoy a deeper, more restful sleep”. Further larger text stated, “THIS IS NOT SPEED”. Beneath that text was an image of a bottle of capsules and to the left there were four boxes. Inside the first box was an image of a brain and the text “MENTAL CLARITY”. In the second was an emoji with a monocle and the text “LASER FOCUS”. In the third was an image of lightning and the text “INCREASED ENERGY”. The fourth box had an emoji of a smiling face and the text “HAPPY MOOD”. b. The second ad stated, “Elevate Your Energy, Enhance Sleep, and Increase Stamina with Just One NMN Capsule Daily”. Further larger text stated, “THIS IS NOT ADDERALL”. Beneath the text was the same content as ad (a).",The complainant challenged whether:,"1., 3. & 4. Viva Research Ltd t/a Vivanmn said regarding the claims ""THIS IS NOT SPEED"" and ""THIS IS NOT ADDERALL"", their intent was to clarify that their product was not a medicine and did not possess the properties of the medicines mentioned. Therefore, the use of speed and Adderall was only to make clear their product was a dietary supplement. They said further, their ads made no claims to treat, prevent or manage attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or any other medical condition. 2. Vivanmn explained that the reference to ""Low energy"" in ad (a) was intended to describe a non-specific feeling experienced by many individuals. It did not refer to a medical condition but the general well-being of an individual that could be influenced by a multitude of lifestyle factors. They reiterated that their product was not advertised to diagnose or treat medical conditions and existed to support general wellness only. They said, based on any feedback, they were open to making amendments to the ads that better aligned them to the CAP Code.","The CAP Code (which reflected legislation) stated that claims which stated or implied a food prevented, treated or cured human disease were not acceptable in marketing communications for foods or food supplement products. It also stated that medicinal claims may be made for a medicinal product that was licensed by the MHRA or under the auspices of the EMA. Medicines must have a license from the MHRA or under the auspices of the EMA before they were marketed. Ad (a) stated “… poor focus or restless nights? Just one NMN capsule a day helps you recharge, refocus, and enjoy a deeper, more restful sleep”. The ad also listed “MENTAL CLARITY”, “LASER FOCUS” and “HAPPY MOOD” and then stated, “THIS IS NOT SPEED”. The ASA understood “speed” was a colloquial term for amphetamine sulphate when used as a recreational drug. We further understood that some medicines prescribed for the treatment of ADHD in the UK contained amphetamine sulphate. We therefore considered that in the context of the claim “THIS IS NOT SPEED” the claims about assisting with focus, mental clarity, sleep and mood, all of which were affected by ADHD, would be interpreted as references that the product could treat those symptoms. Ad (b) stated “… Enhance Sleep … with Just One NMN Capsule Daily”. The ad also listed “MENTAL CLARITY”, “LASER FOCUS” and “HAPPY MOOD” and then stated, “THIS IS NOT ADDERALL”. Adderall was prescribed in the United States for the treatment of ADHD. We therefore considered that in the context of the claim “THIS IS NOT ADDERALL” the claims about assisting with focus, mental clarity, sleep and mood, would be interpreted as meaning the product could treat the symptoms of ADHD. In addition, we further considered that the reference in ad (b) to “ADDERALL” implied that the food supplement had the same effects as the prescription-only medicine. That claim therefore implied that the food supplement had medicinal properties, which fell under the prohibited claims that a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease. Additionally, claims that a product had medicinal properties may only be made for a licensed medicinal product. We had not seen evidence that the product was appropriately licensed. For those reasons we concluded the highlighted claims in ads (a) and (b) were, for the purposes of the legislation reflected in the Code, claims to treat disease, which were prohibited for food and food supplements. In addition, because ad (b) featured a claim that an unlicensed product had medicinal properties, we concluded it breached the Code. On those points, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 12.1 and 12.11 (Medicines, medical devices health-related products and beauty products), 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB NHC Register) were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health. We considered the claim “INCREASED ENERGY” in ad (a) would be understood by consumers to mean that the supplement would improve energy levels. We further considered that the claim “Elevate Your Energy … and Increase Stamina with Just One NMN Capsule Daily” in ad (b) would be understood by consumers to mean that the supplement would improve energy levels. We considered those claims were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code, because they implied that the product had the beneficial health effects listed above. However, we had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that the claims were authorised on the GB NHC Register in relation to the supplement or any of its ingredients, and they therefore breached the Code. On those points, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Viva Research Ltd to ensure their ads did not make claims that a food or food supplement could prevent, treat or cure human disease, which for the purposes of the Code included claims to treat or cure ADHD. We also told them not to make medicinal claims for unlicensed products and to ensure any specific health claims were authorised on the GB Register and complied with the conditions of use for those claims.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/viva-research-ltd-a25-1279959-viva-research-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on air up GmbH,,"A paid-for TikTok ad for air up, a water bottle company, seen on 13 February 2025, featured a man lying on a road marking of a bicycle and pretending to pedal. A voiceover said, “What the fuck, are you high? Get hydrated.” On-screen text stated, “What the f#%l? Are you hy?”. A caption stated, “Ready to Get Hy?”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad was offensive.,"air up GmbH said that the phrase “Are you high” was not a reference to the use of drugs. They said that the phrase was a colloquial reference to someone acting strangely or ‘out of their mind’. They said that the use of the word “fuck” was not offensive in the context of the ad and was used as a colloquial expression of surprise and frustration. On both of those points, air up provided various examples which they believed demonstrated the colloquial meaning of those phrases.air up said that the ad was no longer running.","The CAP Code stated that ads must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. The ad was a TikTok video which featured a man pretending to pedal whilst lying on top of a road marking of a bicycle. The voiceover stated, “What the fuck? Are you high?” and on-screen text stated, “What the f#%I? Are you Hy?”. We understood that the ad was targeted to a general adult audience. We considered that consumers would understand the phrase “are you high”, in combination with the imagery used, to imply that the man was behaving out of character due to being under the influence of recreational drugs. We understood that while the use of “high” was a play on the word “hydrated”, the use of drugs was not relevant to the product. We considered that, by presenting the effects of drugs as a subject of humour and including the caption “Ready to get Hy”, the reference trivialised recreational drug use by humourising the serious psychological effects it could have on an individual. Although we acknowledged that the word “fuck” had numerous connotations, consumer research by the ASA and other bodies showed that the use of words such as “fuck” were likely to offend to such an extent that they should not be used at all in marketing communications even if they were relevant to the product, unless very carefully targeted to an audience that was unlikely to be offended by them. We understood that was not the case for this ad. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad was irresponsible and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. The ad breached CAP (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social Responsibility) and 4.1 (Harm and Offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told air up GmbH to ensure their ads were prepared responsibly and did not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence by, for example, avoiding expletives and claims which trivialised recreational drug use.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/air-up-gmbh-a25-1281155-air-up-gmbh.html
ASA Ruling on GreenPixel Ltd t/a Hotel Merge Empire,,"An in-game ad for the mobile game Hotel Merge Empire, seen in the Block Puzzle mobile app on 19 February, showed a woman holding a baby while standing on a porch. She was surrounded by a man, a younger woman and an older woman. The man pointed to her and said “NOW”, while the younger woman pushed her down the stairs. The older woman then forcibly took the baby from the woman’s arms, as she was shown saying “NO!”. The woman walked back up to the porch and was then kicked back down the stairs again by the man.","The complainant, who believed that the ad trivialised and condoned domestic violence, challenged whether the ad was offensive and irresponsible.","GreenPixel Ltd t/a Hotel Merge Empire said that they did not intend to cause offence and took their responsibility to adhere to the CAP Code seriously. The ad was part of a test campaign, which they said was shown to only a small number of users. However, they understood the importance of compliance, regardless of scale. They said that they placed age-targeting measures in all their ad campaigns to ensure that their content was only viewed by mature audiences. The animated, cartoonish style of the ad was consistent with the visual identity of their game. They believed that style was integral to their brand, and its use in the ad was intended to ensure visual design consistency, rather than to trivialise serious issues. They said the storyline shown in the ad did not depict domestic violence because the woman shown in the storyline was not the child’s mother or a member of the family. Instead, the woman was portrayed as the child’s nanny, who had failed to meet the expected standards of care for her role. The father’s aggression was driven by his fear that she might attempt to take the child and reflected an exaggerated response in the context of the narrative. They highlighted that the story concluded with the child returning unharmed to a loving family, which they believed reinforced that lasting harm did not occur. They confirmed that the ad had been withdrawn, and that it, along with similar creatives, would not be used in future. Big Cake Group Ltd, the creator of the Block Puzzle game in which ad had appeared, said that they were unable to identify which network served the ad. This was because they worked with several ad networks who sold their inventory using a bidding model. They did however provide a list of all of the ad networks that they used.","The CAP Code required marketers to avoid causing serious or widespread offence and to ensure advertising was prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. It further stated that marketing communications must contain nothing that was likely to condone or encourage violence. The ad showed a woman being pushed down the stairs, outside a home, by another woman, while holding a baby. After being pushed, the woman was then shown having the baby forcibly taken from her and appeared visibly distressed as she shouted “NO”. In her attempt to take the baby back, she was kicked down the stairs for a second time by a man, who was depicted in an angry and aggressive manner. We considered that consumers would understand that the woman and baby had been physically assaulted. We considered there was nothing in the ad to indicate that the woman was the baby’s nanny, and we further considered consumers would likely assume that the woman was the baby’s mother, because of her visible distress after the baby was taken from her care. On that basis, we considered that some consumers would understand that the woman was, or had previously been in, a relationship with the male character. Irrespective of the nature of the relationships between the characters, we considered the violence depicted in the ad was unacceptable. Furthermore, the ad featured bright colours and a cartoonish animation style which we considered gave the ad a playful and light-hearted tone. We considered that the ad appeared to present portrayals of assault with the purpose of entertaining viewers and made light of violence. We considered that the ad, in portraying assault in that way, had the effect of condoning violence, including domestic violence, and furthermore, was irresponsible and likely to cause serious and widespread offence, particularly in the context of an ad for a mobile app game. On that basis, we concluded that the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.4 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told GreenPixel Ltd t/a Hotel Merge Empire to ensure that their ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious or widespread offence, including by trivialising, condoning or encouraging domestic violence.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/greenpixel-ltd-a25-1279874-greenpixel-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Insulet International Limited t/a Omnipod,"On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling was received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ad and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code .","A video on demand (VOD) ad for Omnipod5, an insulin delivery system, seen on ITVX on 27 December 2024. The ad featured a woman wearing the Omnipod 5 as the voiceover stated, “I am loving this. Managing diabetes used to pull me away from the fun, but Omnipod5 works with my sensors to help keep me in range […] Meet Omnipod5. Automated insulin delivery simplified. Consult your healthcare professional before starting on Omnipod. For risk information and instructions for use go to omnipod.com”. Separate text in small print appeared four times throughout the ad, which included safety warnings for the product. The end of the ad featured a full page of text that explained the design of the Omnipod 5 System, what it was intended to do and general cautionary advice.",,"Insulet International Ltd t/a Omnipod said the ad was created in accordance with Clearcast VOD guidelines and successfully passed their clearance process. Based on the clearance received, they proceeded with the understanding that the ad met the necessary standards. Clearcast said the small print was clear and readable and was presented in either white or black as appropriate to the background. The text was at the bottom of the screen, where a viewer would expect it to be, and it was not obscured. They said because the ad was for a medical product, the ad featured a lot of small print. The advertiser wanted to give sufficient information about the product’s suitability and conditions of use for viewers. The advertiser also wanted to clarify the studies on which the claims were based. That information helped viewers to make an informed decision as to whether the product was right for them. Clearcast said they were mindful of the requirement in the CAP Code that qualifications must be presented clearly. They considered that the text was legible and clear to anyone who wanted to read it by using the pause feature available on a VOD service. Regarding whether the small print appeared on screen for long enough, they said that no time limit was mandated under the CAP Code for qualifications appearing on screen and CAP guidance on the use of qualifications did not refer to timing with a VOD service.","The CAP Code stated that qualifications must be presented clearly. The ad was for an insulin delivery system and qualifications appeared in the ad four times. The qualifications included safety warnings, and the end of the ad featured a full page of qualifications explaining the design of the Omnipod 5 System, what it was intended to do and general cautionary advice. We acknowledged Clearcast’s comments that the CAP Code did not mandate minimum size for qualifications or refer to their timing and that they considered the ad met the requirement that disclaimers were legible and as it was a VOD ad, it could be paused to read the text. However, the CAP guidance on qualifications stated that for online and other non-broadcast audio-visual marketing communications, advertisers should ensure that qualifying text included in video or other moving image formats should be sized appropriately, and for it to be clearly legible to the average consumer reading the ad from a reasonable distance and at a reasonable speed. In addition, it stated that qualifying text should be displayed on screen long enough for consumers to read it. We considered safety warnings regarding a medical device constituted significant information for consumers and therefore must be presented clearly and legibly, and that viewers should not be expected to pause the ad to read the qualifications. We also considered, however, that the text was small and therefore was not clearly legible when read at a reasonable distance. Further to that, we considered the qualifications overall did not appear on screen long enough for consumers to read them, especially because a large amount of text was displayed. Therefore, because the qualifications were not presented clearly, we concluded the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.10 (Qualification).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Phusion Projects LLC t/a FourLoko,,"An Instagram post from FourLoko, a brewer of alcoholic drinks, seen on 18 February 2025, included the caption “SEND IT [three rocket emojis]”. An image showed a man with his head tipped back and pouring a can of FourLoko into his open mouth from a height.","The complainant, who believed the ad encouraged drinking alcohol unwisely, challenged whether it was irresponsible.","Phusion Projects LLC t/a FourLoko said that they had removed the ad and would not use any image showing a consumer pouring a product into their mouth from a height in future. They said that they had deliberately packaged the FourLoko product to ensure it contained under four units of alcohol, in line with guidance on single-serve containers from the Portman Group. They considered their ad in the context of other ASA rulings. By limiting it to one can of 3.7 units they believed they had mitigated the risk of the man not being able to control the amount of alcohol consumed. They also believed there was no suggestion in the ad that the individual had consumed, or would consume, more than a single beverage. FourLoko said the background in the image and the accompanying caption reflected their brand which focused on live music events. The caption was intended to reflect the enjoyment to be had by consuming FourLoko at such an event. It was not intended to represent speed of consumption. Nonetheless, they acknowledged that there could be some ambiguity in the combination of the image and caption. They said they would keep that in mind for future marketing.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be socially responsible and must contain nothing that is likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that were unwise. For example, they should not encourage excessive drinking. The ad featured an image of a man pouring from a can of FourLoko, an alcoholic drink which we understood had alcohol by volume (ABV) of 8.4%, into his mouth from a height. The ASA considered that style of drinking would make it difficult to control how much alcohol was being consumed and at what speed. Therefore, the image showed a drinking style that would allow a large amount of alcohol to be consumed quickly, and in an uncontrolled and irresponsible manner, and we considered that style of drinking unwise. We also considered that the text “SEND IT” followed by three rocket emojis would be likely to be understood as representing speed and that reinforced the impression that the beverage should be consumed quickly. We therefore considered that by portraying and encouraging a style of drinking that was unwise, the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 18.1 (Alcohol).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Phusion Projects LLC t/a FourLoko that future ads should be socially responsible and not contain anything that was likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that were unwise.

ASA Ruling on Vodafone Ltd t/a vodafone,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A website for Vodafone, www.vodafone.co.uk, seen in November and December 2024, featured product listings for two SIM cards: a. The listing for the Unlimited Plus SIM stated “Save £240. Monthly £23. Offer ends 19 December”. b. The listing for the Unlimited Max SIM stated “Black Friday: Save £312. Monthly £23. Offer ends 2 December”. c. The listing, which was a previous version of ad (a), stated “Unlimited Plus. Black Friday. Save £312. Monthly £20. Offer ends 02 December”. d. The listing, which was a previous version of ad (b), stated “Unlimited Max. 6 months half price. Monthly £18. £36pm after 6 months. Offer ends 28 November”.",EE challenged whether:,"1. Vodafone Ltd said that, during the full 149-day promotional period from September to January, the Unlimited Plus was on offer for 33% of the time, while the Unlimited Max was on offer for 49% of the time. They said the reference price for the product in ad (a) was £33 while the reference price for the product in ad (b) was £36. Those were the prices against which the savings claims of £240 in ad (a) and £312 in ad (b) were made against. However, for both products, they acknowledged that the reference price was not the immediately preceding price. That was because both products had previously been on offer at a discounted price in a different promotion. 2. Vodafone acknowledged that the promotion for the Unlimited Plus SIM in ad (a) was run back-to-back with the Black Friday promotion in ad (c). They also acknowledged that the promotion for the Unlimited Plus Max SIM in ad (b) was run back-to-back with the Black Friday promotion in ad (d). They therefore acknowledged the products in ads (c) and (d) did not return to the price against which the savings were being claimed once the promotions ended. Vodafone acknowledged that CAP guidance stated prices should have been reverted to the reference price, before they were discounted again.","The ASA considered consumers would understand from the claim “Save £240” in ad (a) and “Save £312” in ad (b) that the promotions represented genuine savings against the prices at which the products were usually sold at the time the ads appeared. The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) Guidance For Traders on Pricing Practices offered practical advice to traders on consumer protection laws and associated practices. While we noted that the guidance provided a set of principles rather than statutory rules, we took the Guidance into account when making our assessment. The Guidance stated that it was important that price comparisons were genuine. Comparing a current price to a higher one when it was not the last price the product was sold at, because there had been intervening prices, was an example given in the Guidance of a price comparison that might not be genuine. Both ads were for promotions that ended in December. We understood that the quoted saving of £240 for the Unlimited Plus SIM in ad (a) was based on a price of £33 a month, which had been charged from 4 September to 31 October. However, we understood £33 wasn’t the immediately preceding price of the product because there had been two intervening prices, one for a Black Friday sale and another for a November sale. We also acknowledged that the quoted saving of £312 for the Unlimited Max SIM in ad (b) was similarly based on a price of £36 a month which had been charged from 4 September to 31 October. However, we once again understood that was not the immediately preceding price of the product, with the previous price including a six-month half price promotion from 1 to 28 November. Because of that, we considered the quoted savings claims for both products had not been made against the immediately preceding prices at which the products were sold at when the ads appeared. Consequently, that meant the quoted saving of £240 in ad (a) and £312 in ad (b) were not genuine. Because we had not seen evidence that the savings claim in both ads represented a genuine saving, we concluded that the ads were misleading. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.17 (Prices) Ad (c) was a Black Friday promotion for the Unlimited Plus SIM for a price of £20 a month, which stated “offer ends 2 December”, whilst ad (d) was a six-month half price promotion for the Unlimited Max SIM for a price of £18 a month, which stated “offer ends 28 November”. We considered consumers would understand that when a promotion reached its end date, the advertised product would revert to its standard, non-promotional price. We considered consumers would understand that they only had until the end date of each promotion to get a discount on each product before they reverted back to their non-promotional prices, which was £33 a month for the Unlimited Plus SIM and £36 a month for the Unlimited Max SIM. However, we understood that when the promotions for the Unlimited Plus SIM in ad (c) and for the Unlimited Max SIM in ad (d) ended, another promotion for each product had begun immediately. Those promotions were the ones seen in ads (a) and (b). That meant the products did not revert back to the non-promotional prices of £33 and £36 a month. Because the products in both ads did not return to the prices against which the savings were being claimed once the promotions ended, we concluded that the ads were misleading. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.17 (Prices).","The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of. We told Vodafone Ltd to ensure that future savings claims did not mislead and to ensure products returned to the price against which the saving was being claimed, once a promotion ended.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/vodafone-ltd-a24-1272001-vodafone-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on ZOE Ltd t/a Zoe,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Zoe, a food supplement retailer, seen on 19 September 2024, stated “Daily30+ is a plant-based wholefood supplement…[poo emoji] Contains chicory inulin”. Below that further text stated, “This is a supplement revolution. No ultra-processed pills, no shakes, just real food. Steven Barlett [sic]”.","The complainant, a professor in nutrition and food science, challenged whether the claim “This is a supplement revolution. No ultra-processed pills, no shakes, just real food” misleadingly implied that the product did not contain any ultra-processed ingredients.","ZOE Ltd t/a Zoe said they were a science and nutrition company that participated in research and produced publications with the aim to support consumers to understand Ultra Processed Foods (UPFs) and improve their health and wellbeing. They said the ad did not claim Daily 30+ was not ultra-processed, nor that it did not include any ultra-processed ingredients. Instead, the ad had been designed to explain that within the supplement category the product, designed as a real food supplement, was not an ultra-processed pill, unlike other supplements that would be considered ultra-processed because they contained artificial flavourings and additives. They said “wholefood supplement” was an accurate description because the product was made of whole foods with no added preservative, sweeteners or flavour enhancers and they were confident their product met the requirement for classification of a supplement. They highlighted that there was no universally accepted single, legal or scientific established definition of UPFs. They referenced the NOVA classification system, which they said helped demonstrate the effects of high UPFs consumption when products were formulated mostly or entirely of substances extracted from foods or derived from food constituents, which included snacks, drinks and ready meals. They explained the classification system was not designed to be applied to individual ingredients, but rather an entire product. They cited the House of Lords Food, Diet and Obesity Committee report “Recipe for health: a plan to fix our broken food system” which stated that UPFs were typically calorie-dense foods with few valuable nutrients that lacked fibre, contained high levels of unhealthy fats, refined sugar and salt, and whose ingredients had been altered. A further report from 2019 “Ultra-processed foods: what they are and how to identify them” set out a similar definition. Their product did not fit the NOVA classification criteria, nor did it fit any of the definitions or characteristics outlined in the reports. The complainant had referred to a blog post on the ZOE website that they said suggested a product was ultra processed when it was produced using industrial-scale production methods and contained ingredients that would not be recognised or used in home cooking. ZOE said that definition had been taken out of context. The post had been written for a general audience and explained that a product could not be classified as UPFs just because industrial-scale production methods (such as canning, fermenting, freezing, and drying) had been used during the manufacturing process. Zoe said the advertised product was a combination of 32 different foods, that included vegetables, fruits, seeds and mushrooms, that was put directly onto other food to increase fibre intake. Since they restricted the amount of ingredients that were finely ground, the product was designed to retain the food matrix of its ingredients. All ingredients went through the standard cleaning process for wholefoods, which included the removal of shell, soil and small stones where necessary. Whole seeds and nibbed nuts were used in the product, and while some ingredients were powdered, the only liquid ingredient was the chicory root inulin. Inulin was a well-researched fibre and chicory root was a natural, rich source of inulin. Chicory root inulin had proven health benefits, authorised health claim, and was used in the product for its fibre health benefit. Similarly, nutritional yeast flakes, a form of heated yeast, had known health benefits that included B-vitamins and minerals and was a good source of protein. They highlighted it was a commonly used culinary ingredient. They also said there was nothing ‘unhealthy’ about either ingredient that made up only a small percentage of the overall product, and that the chicory root inulin specifically was extracted using a typical process that they believed was not relevant to the product’s overall NOVA classification. They explained that none of the ingredients were typical UPF ingredients and the processes used could be replicated in a small-scale home kitchen. Therefore, they highlighted that their product was a plant mix that was distinctly different from UPF products high in additives, fat, salt and sugar that are associated with poor health outcomes, and that labelling of their product as UPF on the basis of a higher level of processing of two ingredients would create a misunderstanding and increase consumer misinformation.","There was no universally accepted definition of UPFs. The term had been introduced in 2009 as part of the NOVA classification system, which focused on foods and their level of industrial processing and had since fallen into more general usage. The ASA understood that while studies into consumer awareness of UPFs were limited in the UK, a scoping review of evidence report from the Advisory Committee for Social Science, an independent expert committee of the Food Standards Agency (FSA), found that many consumers did not understand the specific nature of UPFs. We considered the review showed consumers’ understanding of UPFs was not fully aligned with the NOVA classification, and that they would not be able to accurately categorise foods using the system. Instead, consumers were likely to understand in general terms that UPFs were ‘unhealthy’, and that non-UPFs were ‘healthy’. The use of the term “UPFs” could therefore act as a deterrent to consuming products that were believed to contain them. We considered consumers would understand the claim “Daily 30+ is a […] wholefood supplement” to mean the product comprised solely of wholefood ingredients. They would understand wholefoods to be those foods that were either unprocessed or had undergone minimal levels of processing. Consequently, consumers would expect that the ingredients used in the product were all very close to their unprocessed form, and therefore those ingredients and the product as a whole were not UPFs. The ad stated, “just real food” and “No Ultra-processed pills, no shakes”, which we considered contributed to that overall impression. We acknowledged consumers were likely to understand that most food products had been subject to some level of processing, for example cleaning or chopping. They were unlikely to consider foods that had undergone that minimal level of processing to be UPFs. However, at least two ingredients, chicory root inulin and nutritional yeast flakes, were not whole foods and had been through more than a minimal level of processing. Nutritional yeast was manufactured, and chicory root inulin was extracted using an industrial process. For the latter, the extraction process included slicing and steeping, purification using carbonated water as well as evaporation, partial enzymatic hydrolysis (adding of enzymes) and filtration. While some of those processes were relatively simple in isolation, we considered the number of stages used in processing went beyond what consumers would interpret as minimal and we considered they would likely understand chicory root inulin as UPFs. We also considered that the product as a whole would not fall within the NOVA classification of UPFs, nor did the overall product fulfil the criteria of a UPF as defined by the House of Lords report. However, because consumer perception of UPFs was not likely aligned with these classifications or definitions, we considered it was unlikely that consumers would be aware that the NOVA classification or other scientific definitions of UPFs referred to the whole product rather than individual ingredients. For those reasons we considered the claim “This is a supplement revolution. No ultra-processed pills, no shakes, just real food” implied the product did not contain any ingredients that consumers would interpret as ultra-processed when that was not the case and was therefore likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading Advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).",The ad must not appear in the form complained of. We told ZOE Ltd not to make claims that their products did not contain UPFs ingredients if consumers were likely to interpret the ingredients to be ultra-processed.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/zoe-ltd-a24-1261050-zoe-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Golden Vape UK Ltd t/a Golden Vape,"This ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on the promotion of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components in paid-for Google ads, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also the related ruling published on 14 May 2025.","A paid-for Google ad for Golden Vape, provided by the aggregator website Shoparade.uk, seen on 22 November 2024.

Text in the ad stated “4 in 1 Pods, Replaceable … £4.50 … Free delivery, eBay … Pods, Prefilled … By Shoparad … Shop now”.","The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code by promoting unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components through a sponsored link.","Golden Vape UK Ltd said they had never run, approved or been involved in any advertising through Google or any other platform. They said the ad had been provided by Shoparade.uk, a third-party aggregator. Golden Vape said they had no relationship with Shoparade.uk; that they had not been aware of their actions; and had not authorised them to advertise on their behalf. On becoming aware of the ad, they had contacted Shoparade.uk to request the removal of any unauthorised links or ads associated with Golden Vape. Native Shopping Media UG t/a Shoparade.uk did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.","The ASA was concerned by Native Shopping Media UG’s (Shoparade.uk) lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. CAP Code rule 22.12 reflected a legislative ban contained in the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 (TRPR) on the advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes in certain media. The rule stated that, except for media targeted exclusively to the trade, marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components which were not licensed as medicines were not permitted in newspapers, magazines and periodicals or in online media and some other forms of electronic media. It further stated that factual claims about products were permitted on marketers’ own websites and, in certain circumstances, in other non-paid-for space online under the marketer’s control. Golden Vape had originally listed their products for sale on eBay. We understood from eBay (UK) Ltd that, by using their site, sellers signed up to a User Agreement which required them to consent to third parties having access to seller listings for the purposes of advertising those listings, including on third-party advertising placements. There was no method of opting out of that requirement and there was no subsequent notification to sellers when their goods were promoted via one of eBay’s third-party partners. When a purchase was made through one of the third-party partner’s links, the third-party partner received a fee from eBay. We understood there was no additional cost to the consumer when buying through one of the third-party links. The paid-for Google ad, which had been placed by one of eBay’s third-party partners, was not targeted exclusively to the trade and prominently featured an image of the packaging of the vape product next to the product itself, which was not licensed as a medicine. The ad clicked through to a page where nicotine-containing replacement pods for e-cigarettes could be purchased. The page featured a larger version of the same image of the product’s packaging next to the product itself, together with the text “Elf Bar 4 in 1 Pods – Replaceable Prefilled Pods … 20mg – 3200puffs [sic] – New” and “£4.50 Free postage”. We considered the ad therefore had the effect of promoting e-cigarettes not licensed as medicines; consequently, the restriction that applied to online media under rule 22.12 was applicable. We understood that the ad had been created solely by Shoparage.uk, the third-party partner, without any input from Golden Vape and that Golden Vape had been unaware of the ad. However, as the marketer, they were responsible under the CAP Code for ensuring that their ads complied. We welcomed the action Golden Vape had taken to request the removal of any unauthorised links or ads associated with them. However, since the ad had the direct or indirect effect of promoting e-cigarettes that were not licensed as medicines in non-permitted media, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 22.12 (Electronic cigarettes).",The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Golden Vape UK Ltd t/a Golden Vape and Native Shopping Media UG t/a Shoparade.uk to ensure that marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components that were not licensed medicines should not appear in paid-for Google ads or in other non-permitted media.

It further stated that factual claims about products were permitted on marketers’ own websites and, in certain circumstances, in other non-paid-for space online under the marketer’s control. UKVAPINGSTORE had originally listed their products for sale on eBay. We understood from eBay (UK) Ltd that, by using their site, sellers signed up to a User Agreement that required them to consent to third parties having access to seller listings for the purposes of advertising those listings, including on third-party advertising placements. There was no method of opting out and there was no subsequent notification to sellers when their goods were promoted via one of eBay’s third-party partners. When a purchase was made through one of the third-party partner’s links, the third-party partner received an amount from eBay. There was no additional cost to the consumer when buying through one of the third-party links. The paid-for Google ad, which was placed by one of eBay’s third-party partners, was not targeted exclusively to the trade and prominently featured 12 nicotine-containing replacement pods for e-cigarettes, which were not licensed as medicines. The ad clicked through to a page where nicotine-containing replacement pods for e-cigarettes could be purchased and featured the text “UKVAPINGSTORE” and “Buy 3 Get 1 FREE … Buy 7 get 3 FREE … Buty 10 Get 4 FREE”, with images of replacement pods, which we considered was both promotional and in non-permitted media. While we understood that UKVAPINGSTORE might not have set out to promote e-cigarettes that were not licensed as medicines in non-permitted media, they as the marketer were nevertheless responsible under the CAP Code for ensuring that their ads complied, notwithstanding the fact that the ad may have been created solely by the third-party partner without any input from UKVAPINGSTORE themselves. We welcomed Falcon Galaxy’s assurance that the ad had been removed from current and future advertising campaigns. However, since the ad had the direct or indirect effect of promoting e-cigarettes in non-permitted media, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 22.12 (Electronic cigarettes).",The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told UK Electronic Cigarette Ltd t/a UKVAPINGSTORE and Falcongalaxy.com Ltd t/a Falcon Galaxy to ensure that marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components that were not licensed medicines should not appear in paid-for Google ads or in other non-permitted media. We referred the matter to CAP's Compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/uk-electronic-cigarette-ltd-a24-1269901-uk-electronic-cigarette-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Cloud Whale Interactive Technology,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An in-game ad for the mobile app PolyBuzz, an AI chat platform, seen on 10 February 2025 in the app game ‘Room Sort’ featured an animated image of a woman who had her mouth open. The image was partially obscured by overlaid text that stated, “Me after finding a cai alternative with No Filters!!”. It also featured a text-message exchange in which one party asked, “so do you want me to kiss you”, “or do you want me to f**k you”, “you know what I want to hear from you”, “say something” [sic]. The other party replied, “Please taste me”.","The complainant, who understood that the 'Room Sort' game was classified as being suitable for all ages, challenged whether the ad:","Cloud Whale Interactive Technology did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. Gamincat Inc, the developer of the game in which the ad was seen, said that they had implemented restrictions on adult-related ads through ad network filters but somehow this ad had been displayed. They had therefore asked ad network companies to block the advertiser, so that it would not appear again. Gamincat Inc also told us that they had not received any direct complaints about the ad.","The ASA was concerned by Cloud Whale Interactive Technology’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code required marketers to avoid causing serious or widespread offence and to ensure advertising was prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The ad depicted a text exchange between two characters which was of a sexual nature. It featured the text “Me after finding a cai alternative with No Filters!!” which we considered users of the app would be likely to understand to mean an AI-generated character which had no filters or restrictions on what it could say. It included the text “do you want me to f**k you” [sic]. We considered that those who saw the ad would understand that it implied the word ‘fuck’ and the question was therefore pertaining to sexual intercourse. We considered ‘fuck’ a word so likely to offend that it should not generally be used or alluded to in advertising. The ad also featured the text “Please taste me” which we considered, in that context, some users of the app were likely to understand as being sexual innuendo alluding to engaging in oral sex. The ad had appeared in the game 'Room Sort'. 'Room Sort' was rated as suitable for those aged 12 years and older which meant it could be downloaded by children. The advertiser provided no information about how they targeted their advertising, or if they used interest-based criteria to do so. Because the ad contained extremely offensive language which was also pertaining to sexual intercourse in a medium that would have had broad appeal, including to children, as well as other sexual references, we considered it was likely to cause serious and widespread offence, and had been targeted irresponsibly. We therefore concluded that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.1 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Cloud Whale Interactive Technology to ensure that future ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious or widespread offence, including by avoiding references to expletives or sexual references unless in a suitably targeted medium. We also told them to ensure that their ads were responsibly targeted. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/cloud-whale-interactive-technology-a25-1278753-cloud-whale-interactive-technology.html
ASA Ruling on Living and Home Ltd,,"A product listing for a Living and Home brand draining rack, seen on the Debenhams website on 30 November 2024. Text in the listing stated, “Kitchen 2-Tier Metal Dish Drainer Rack […] £18.99 … Save 83%”. A struck through price of “£113.33” was shown next to the current price.","The complainant, who believed the product had not previously been sold for £113.33, challenged whether the savings claim was misleading.","Living and Home Ltd said the original price of the draining rack was based on market pricing strategies and aligned with the prices of similar products on the market. Due to high inventory levels, they had implemented a clearance strategy starting in December 2023, which was why the price was heavily reduced. They said they were unable to provide recent sales records showing units sold at the original price because of an IT issue, but maintained the product had been sold at £133.33 for an extended period before it was discounted. They said they planned to return the product to the original price once the promotion had ended. Boohoo Group plc t/a Debenhams confirmed that the pricing and discounting of items sold via their website was controlled and managed by the relevant third parties selling through the platform.","The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “Save 83%” to mean that they would be able to make a genuine saving of 83% against the usual selling price of the listed product at the time the ad appeared. We acknowledged Living and Home’s view that the product had been sold at the full price for an extended period of time. However, for the savings claim to be substantiated, they needed to provide the pricing history of the product, including the number of units sold at each price, which they had not done. Because we did not receive that pricing history, we had not seen any evidence to determine the usual selling price of the product. We had also not seen evidence which showed the length of time it had been reduced by 83% against the purported usual selling price. We therefore concluded the savings claim had not been substantiated and was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (Prices).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Living and Home Ltd to ensure that their future savings claims did not mislead and were substantiated against the usual selling price of the products.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/living-and-home-ltd-a24-1270389-living-and-home-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Rosenthal Capital Ltd t/a ULEZProsperity,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A website for ULEZProsperity, https://www.ulezprosperity.com/ seen in October 2024 featured the claims, “Short term, high yield returns. Capitalise on exceptional returns ranging from 21% +” and “EXAMPLE RETURNS WITH CAPITAL DEPLOYED” and listed a range of yields from 22.12% to 23.72% based on assets ranging from £20,000 to £30,000. Text also stated, “EARN STEADY INCOME AND SECURE RETURNS” and “FIXED MONTHLY INCOME”. Smaller text at the bottom of the website stated, “While capital is 100% guaranteed, returns are projected. Past performance does not guarantee future results”.",,"1. Rosenthal Capital Ltd t/a ULEZProsperity said customers rented a vehicle to ULEZProsperity for a fixed monthly return under a defined contract term of 37 months, providing a predictable income. In month 38, ULEZProsperity facilitated the vehicle disposal, but at no point did ownership transfer to ULEZProsperity during the contract term. At the end of the rental period, ULEZProsperity had first refusal to repurchase the vehicle at a pre-agreed price. Customers retained full legal ownership, which was evidenced by the vehicle’s registration document, invoices and contracts, that were issued in the customer’s name. They said the yield figures stated on their website were substantiated by a rental yield formula widely recognised in the property sector. The calculations were based on fixed monthly rental payments over a defined term with no fluctuation. They said those figures were not speculative; they were contractually defined and therefore fully substantiated. They provided a positive customer testimonial of their service, which they said supported their assertion that they operated transparently and delivered on their commitments. They said they understood from the ASA’s guidance on substantiation that testimonials alone were not sufficient evidence to substantiate claims. However, they believed testimonials served as supporting evidence of customer experience and transparency. They further explained that underlying their return projections was revenue they generated through six income streams, including monthly rental payments, commission from finance on the vehicles and the final disposal of vehicles, where at the end of the contract term (38 months), the asset was either resold or refinanced. Given that ULEZProsperity operated with six income streams per asset and minimal liabilities, the model was self-sustaining and robust. 2. ULEZProsperity said they did not offer a financial product that was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). They said their business model did not involve collective investment schemes, financial instruments or lending services. Instead, the model operated as a straightforward asset purchase and rental agreement, which was not a type of regulated financial promotion. They said that the rental payments made to investors were fixed and outlined in a legally binding agreement. Projections were only referenced when discussing potential future returns beyond the fixed rental term. They said they had maintained a 100% repayment record, with no complaints from clients regarding non-payment of rental income and that the contractual nature of the payments was fundamental to their business model and differentiated them from speculative investments. Nevertheless, to ensure clarity, they said that explanatory text could be included to explicitly state that the product was not a financial product or a regulated investment.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so and that before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers were likely to regard as objective and that were capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation. The ad stated, “Capitalise on exceptional returns ranging from 21% +” and listed a range of yields from 22.12% to 23.72% based on assets ranging from £20,000 to £30,000. We considered that consumers would understand the ad to mean that, by purchasing and then renting a vehicle to ULEZProsperity, they could expect to achieve returns from 21% to 23.72%. We noted ULEZProsperity’s comment that the return figures were based on fixed monthly rental payments over a defined term, with no fluctuation, and that they were contractually defined and therefore fully substantiated. However, the only substantiation ULEZProsperity provided to substantiate the return claims was a customer testimonial and we did not consider that customer endorsements alone constituted adequate substantiation. ULEZProsperity therefore did not provide sufficient evidence to support their investment returns claims and we concluded that the claims were misleading and had not been substantiated. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). The CAP Code required offers of financial products to be set out in a way that allowed them to be understood easily by the audience being addressed. Marketers were required to ensure that they did not take advantage of consumers’ inexperience or credulity. In addition, the basis used to calculate any rate of interest, forecast or projection should be apparent immediately. Marketing communications were also required to make clear that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up. If the value of the investment was guaranteed, the marketing communication should explain the guarantee. We acknowledged ULEZProsperity’s comments that they did not offer a financial product that was regulated by the FCA and that their product operated as an asset purchase and rental agreement, which they understood did not constitute a regulated financial promotion. However, the focus of the ad was on promoting a buy to let arrangement for cars that we considered was likely to be understood by consumers as a type of investment. Therefore, the ad promoted a financial product. We understood specifically that consumers bought a ULEZ-compliant car from ULEZProsperity, and the consumer retained full ownership of the car. The consumer then rented the car out via ULEZProsperity to key workers to earn a fixed, monthly income that they said was guaranteed. We also understood that the rental period was usually 37 months and at the end of the contract the consumer sold the car to ULEZProsperity for a pre-arranged price. While it was usual to sell the car at 37 months, there was also the option to continue renting the vehicle out, but the income after 37 months was not guaranteed. The ad made references to “secure returns”, “fixed monthly income” and how “capital is 100% guaranteed”. However, we considered that the guarantee, which they told us was limited to rental income up to 38 months and the sale of the car, was not explained or made clear on the website. We acknowledged ULEZProsperity’s comment that projections were only referenced when discussing potential future returns beyond the usual fixed rental term and we noted that the website featured a risk warning at the bottom of the website which stated, “While capital is 100% guaranteed, returns are projected. Past performance does not guarantee future results”. However, we considered it was not clear that the warning referred only to rental income generated after 37 months and that the risk warning was in any case not displayed prominently on the website. Further, the website featured the claims “Capitalise on exceptional returns ranging from 21% +”, “EXAMPLE RETURNS WITH CAPITAL DEPLOYED” and listed a range of yields from 22.12% to 23.72% based on assets ranging from £20,000 to £30,000. However, it was not clear how those returns or yields had been calculated. Therefore, the website promoted a financial product but was not set out in a way that allowed it to be understood easily by the audience being addressed. In addition, the basis used to calculate any rate of interest, forecast or projection was not immediately apparent. Finally, because the value of investments was variable after 37 months, but the only risk warning on the website that highlighted that was not prominent, and it was unclear it related only to the rental income after 37 months, the ad breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 14.1, 14.3 and 14.4 (Financial products).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Rosenthal Capital Ltd t/a ULEZProsperity to ensure that their future ads did not quote returns unless they held adequate evidence to substantiate the claims and that their ads were set out in a way that allowed them to be understood easily by the audience being addressed. We also told them to ensure the basis used to calculate any rate of interest, forecast or projection was apparent immediately and to make clear that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up and that if the value of the investment was guaranteed, the marketing communication must explain the guarantee.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/rosenthal-capital-ltd-a24-1270983-rosenthal-capital-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Whaleco UK Ltd t/a Temu,,"An in-game ad for Temu seen on 11 February 2025 in the app Spider Solitaire Fun. The ad included a picture of a greetings card, on which text stated, “I’VE MET SOME CUNTS IN MY TIME, BUT YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE THE CUNTIEST HAPPY BIRTHDAY”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread offence.,"Whaleco UK Ltd t/a Temu stated that the ad did not reflect their usual standards of practice and was the result of an isolated incident caused by a temporary glitch in their screening process during a system upgrade for enhancing the screening process. They said that the word “cunt” was already on their blocklist and would normally have been blocked automatically. However, the upgrade caused the product image (a birthday card) to bypass normal checks. They had since run a full system search to ensure no blocklisted terms were being used across other advertising channels. They stated that the ad was served via Meta Audience Network and was chosen by Meta’s algorithm, rather than by Temu directly. They said the ad had been removed proactively before they were contacted by the ASA. Temu emphasised their ongoing collaboration with the ASA and commitment to UK advertising compliance, including implementing more robust processes to avoid similar issues in future.","The CAP Code required marketers to avoid causing serious or widespread offence. The ad, for a birthday card, included the swear word “CUNTS” and “CUNTIEST” and appeared in a solitaire game app rated as being suitable for those aged four years and older. Consumer research by the ASA showed that use of words such as “CUNT” was so likely to offend that they should not be used at all in marketing communications. That was the case even if they were relevant to the product, unless very carefully targeted to an audience that was unlikely to be offended by them. We acknowledged Temu’s commitment to collaborate with the ASA and their proactive removal of the ad, which appeared in error. However, we considered that “CUNT” was a particularly offensive swear word. We therefore concluded that its appearance in the untargeted medium of the solitaire game app was likely to cause both serious and widespread offence. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 4.1 (Harm and Offence).","The ad should not appear again in the form complained of. We told Whaleco UK Ltd t/a Temu to ensure their ads did not cause serious or widespread offence, including by avoiding references to expletives.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/whaleco-uk-ltd-a25-1278825-whaleco-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Dualit Ltd,"On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given the ASA’s assessment of the ad that formed the subject of this ruling was carried out before 7 April 2025 the ASA considered the ad under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code . This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ads making compostable claims, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 30 April.","A paid-for search ad for Dualit coffee bags, seen on 16 August 2024, stated “Dualit Coffee Bags - Compostable Coffee Bags”. Further text below stated “Discover Dualit's compostable coffee bags - café-quality ground coffee in a bag”.",The ASA challenged whether the claim “compostable coffee bags” was misleading.,"Dualit Ltd said their coffee bags had been certified as industrially compostable and were made from polylactic acid (PLA), a material derived from sugars extracted from plants and ground coffee. They said consumers would interpret the claim “Compostable Coffee Bags” to mean the bags were made from a compostable material and would not assume they were home compostable. They said products had to be tested and proved to compost in order to make the claim. Their coffee bags were not home compostable and they were not claiming they would breakdown in a domestic compost, as the testing criteria for domestic composting was fundamentally different to industrial composting. Paid-for search ads were constrained by space, so they provided further information on their website about how to dispose of the product correctly.","CAP guidance stated that if the disposal process referred to in an ad was likely to differ from the average consumer's expectation of what that process entailed, that may be considered material information. The claim was, therefore, likely to need qualification – for example, by making clear where and how, the product should be disposed of. It referred to where compostable products are only suitable for industrial composting, such as when effective degradation would not occur in home composting, as an example of information that may be material to a consumer's transactional decision. Claims which do not clearly and prominently include that information were less likely to comply. The ASA assessed the ad in question against the CAP Code. We considered consumers would understand from the claim “Dualit Coffee Bags - Compostable Coffee Bags”, in the context of a consumer product for use in the home, that the coffee bags were compostable and that they could be composted at home. We understood the coffee bags had been certified to the European Standard EN13432. A product certified to meet that standard was designed to breakdown within an industrial compost. It would therefore not necessarily breakdown within a domestic compost, as the composts differed in composition –, for example in temperature. Also, a product may take longer to breakdown fully in a domestic compost, if at all, and toxic matter may remain. We further understood that compostable plastics should not be placed within plastic recycling collections as they could contaminate plastic recycling streams. Additionally, not all local Councils were able to place industrially compostable plastics, such as when collected with food or garden waste, within an industrial compost and some Councils recommended compostable plastics be placed in a waste bin. The claim “Compostable Coffee Bags” implied the bags, which would typically be used within the home, could be composted in a home composter, but as this was not the case, we considered it was likely to mislead. We considered, within the context of an ad that referred to an industrially compostable product as “compostable”, making clear their intended disposal location, such that it was clear they were not home compostable, and where consumers could find further information about how they could access the intended location, was material information that should have been made clear in the search ad, notwithstanding any space limitations. In any event, we considered the ad was not limited by time or space to such an extent that the information could not be provided. The ad had a character limit of 270 and Dualit had used 132. There was, therefore, sufficient space within the ad format to correctly inform about the nature of the product and how it should be disposed. The webpage the ad immediately linked through to, which listed the various coffee bags available, did not contain further information about how to dispose of the coffee bags properly. We acknowledged that the individual coffee bag product listing pages on Dualit’s website, which the ad did not immediately link through to, stated “industrially compostable; pop the used Coffee Bag into your food waste bin and let your authorised council collection scheme do the rest”. However, we considered it was unclear from the claim “industrially compostable” what action, if any, consumers needed to take. Additionally, the reference to placing the bags in food collection bins required further information, as some Councils recommended against putting compostable plastics in food collection bins. Moreover, that information would only be seen by consumers who scrolled down the full length of the page, and consumers could proceed without seeing this further information to purchase the coffee bags. The ad suggested the bags could be composted in a location that they were not designed for. Also, it did not make clear how consumers should dispose of the product correctly in order to have the claimed effect, which we considered was material information that should have been included in the ad. We concluded the ad was therefore likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 11.1, and 11.2 (Environmental claims).",The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Dualit Ltd to ensure their search ads did not mislead over the correct route for disposal when making composting claims or omit material information about the disposal of compostable products.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/dualit-ltd-A24-1255954.html
ASA Ruling on Groupon International Ltd and Jaoyeh Trading Ltd,,"A website for Groupon, www.groupon.co.uk, seen on 1 January 2025, featured a listing for “Home and Kitchen Mystery Products”. The listing stated “£89.99 [crossed out] £14.99 83% off […] Featuring various items like dog and cat-themed products, gin glass, and spice rack [sic] this mystery box is a delightful surprise for most gift-giving occasions”. Further text under the heading “Fine Print” stated “Original value: Based on online price as sold by jaoyeh.co.uk”.","The complainant, who understood they received a product worth less than the advertised price, challenged whether the claim “£89.99 [crossed out] £14.99 83% off” was misleading.","Groupon International Ltd said their internal guidelines stated that a reference price should not be used for “mystery product” offers because the prices of the products which could have been included in the promotion varied. They said that due to an internal error, a reference price was included for the promotion in question in contravention of those guidelines. They stated the reference price of £89.99 was not based on the highest priced item, which was worth approximately £200, but acknowledged that it was more than the value of the product that the complainant received. They highlighted that when the error was identified, prior to notification of the ASA’s investigation, they paused the offer. Jaoyeh Trading Ltd stated they had addressed the error with Groupon, and highlighted to them that recommended retail prices (RRPs) for mystery boxes were misleading as there were a number of potential items a customer could receive. They stated that the promotion included products valued at up to and exceeding £89.99. They provided links to web pages for five different branded kitchenware products that had RRPs ranging from £119.99 to £200, and the quantity of those products available in the offer. They also provided links to 12 other products on the Jaoyeh website that were included in the offer, which had prices ranging from £15.99 to £159.99.","The ASA understood that Groupon was an e-commerce website which offered a range of third-party products and services and that they did not sell their own products. The ad was for a “Home and Kitchen Mystery Products” offer supplied by Jaoyeh Trading and we understood consumers who purchased the item received one random kitchen or homeware product. The ad stated “£89.99 [crossed out] £14.99 83% off” and “Original value: Based on online price as sold by jaoyeh.co.uk”. We considered consumers were likely to understand from the crossed-out price that the usual selling price of the product they received would be at least £89.99. By purchasing the mystery item for £14.99, consumers would have expected to receive a product which had a usual selling price that was at least £89.99 whilst making the stated saving against that original price. We acknowledged Jaoyeh Trading’s view that some consumers who purchased the mystery item would have received an item worth more than £89.99. However, we understood that the price £89.99 did not relate to the value of the products included in the offer, and some consumers would have received an item that was worth less than that price. We had also not seen specific pricing information for all of the other items included in the “mystery product” offer, including those mentioned in the ad, or evidence to demonstrate the price at which those items were generally sold. Because we had not seen any evidence that showed that the usual selling price of all the products included in the offer was at least £89.99, and that the price reduction represented a genuine saving for consumers, we concluded that the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.17 (Prices).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Groupon International Ltd and Jaoyeh Trading Ltd to ensure that future price claims did not mislead and that savings claims were made against the usual selling price of the product.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/groupon-international-ltd.html

The taste of Lavazza Coffee in a Compostable Capsule [...] Your Espresso at Home"".",The ASA challenged whether the claim “compostable capsules” was misleading.,"Lavazza Coffee (UK) Ltd said “compostable” would be understood as meaning that a product was made of compostable material, and not necessarily that it was compostable within a domestic compost. It was not their intention for consumers to understand the ad as suggesting the capsules were home compostable. The capsules were certified for industrial composting, and that was stated on their website.","CAP guidance stated that if the disposal process referred to in an ad was likely to differ from the average consumer's expectation of what that process entailed, that may be considered material information, and the claim was likely to need qualification – for example, by making clear where and how the product should be disposed of.

We considered, within the context of an ad that referred to an industrially compostable product as “compostable”, making clear their intended disposal location, such that it was clear they were not home compostable, and where consumers could find further information about how they could access the intended location, was material information that should have been made clear in the search ad, notwithstanding any space limitations. In any event, we considered the ad was not limited by time or space to such an extent that the information could not be provided. The ad had a character limit of 270, Lavazza had used 252. There was, therefore, sufficient space within the ad format to correctly inform about the nature of the product and how it should be disposed. Additionally, the ad linked through to a page that listed the different varieties of coffee capsules Lavazza sold, but information about the capsules’ disposal was not referenced there. We acknowledged that other pages of Lavazza’s website did make clear the capsules’ intended disposal location, such as within the “Recycling” section of their “Frequently Asked Questions” page, and the page headed “Lavazza A Modo Mio”, which offered further information about that range. However, as consumers would not necessarily visit those separate pages as part of their purchase journey, the appearance of the information at those locations was not adequate to explain the intended disposal location for the capsules and how consumers could access it. The individual product listing pages for the different varieties of Eco Caps, which could be accessed via the page the ad linked through to, referred to the fact that they were industrially compostable, in that they showed an image of the product’s packaging which contained text that stated ""COMPOSTABLE CAPSULES CERTIFIED EN13432:2002”. However, the reference was too detached from the initial compostable capsules claim and, in any event, it was unlikely to convey to consumers that the capsules were not home compostable. The ad suggested the capsules could be composted in a location that they were not designed for, and did not make clear how consumers should dispose of the product correctly in order to have the claimed effect, which we considered was material information that should have been included in the ad. We concluded the ad was therefore likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 11.1, and 11.2 (Environmental claims).",The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Lavazza Coffee (UK) Ltd to ensure their search ads did not mislead over the correct route for disposal when making composting claims or omit material information about the disposal of compostable products.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/lavazza-coffee-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on ABD Supplies Ltd,"Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ads and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code . Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Two emails and two product listings for ABD.co.uk, a motor vehicle dealer, seen in January and February 2025: a. The first email featured the subject “BACK IN STOCK: Up To 450% Brighter Headlights with HID Kits at ABD.co.uk”. Text in the body of the email stated, “This range is perfect for those looking to achieve maximum brightness on the road”. Below the text were images and links to HID conversion kits for different bulb fittings. b. A product listing for a “H4 HIDS4U Stealth 55W Bi-Xenon HID Conversion Kit”, featured text which stated, “Xenon HID […] gives a significantly brighter light output, with a stronger beam pattern to better illuminate road markings, signs & potential hazards to create a far safer road experience when travelling at night. A specifications table was located in a tab under the heading “Techy Stuff” which stated, “Road Legal: No”. c. The second email featured the subject “25% Off LED Upgrade Bulbs. White, Brighter And CANBUS Ready. ABD.co.uk”. Text in the body of the email stated, “Just remove your standard halogen bulb, and effortlessly replace it with the True FIT LED’s […] Experience nighttime driving like never before […] an astonishing 200% increase in road illumination, your nighttime journeys will feel like driving in broad daylight. You’ll see the road ahead with unparalleled clarity, giving you the ability to spot hazards from a distance and react swiftly to ensure your safety as well as other road users”. The email featured images of different LED bulb products designed to replace halogen bulbs. d. A product listing for “H7/H18 Twenty20 TrueFit LED Headlight Bulb” featured the same text as in ad (c). A specifications table was located in a tab under the heading “Techy Stuff” which stated, “E Marked/Road Legal: No”.","The complainant, who understood that driving a vehicle with a Xenon HID conversion kit or aftermarket LED lights on public roads was illegal, challenged whether the ads were:","1. & 2. ABD Supplies Ltd t/a ABD.co.uk acknowledged that the products were not road legal when fitted to most modern cars, but believed they were legal to use on certain vehicles such as motorcycles and classic cars. They said they published information about the legality of the products on their website in several articles and on a FAQ page.They said the products increased nighttime safety for the driver, other road users and pedestrians and therefore believed the product descriptions were accurate. ABD.co.uk said they would review their product listings and update them to ensure they explained the legality of the products more clearly for consumers.","The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim, “this range is perfect for those looking to achieve maximum brightness on the road”, in ad (a), and “illuminate road markings, signs & potential hazards to create a far safer road experience” in ad (b) to mean that the HID conversion kits could be legally fitted to vehicles in the UK. We also considered the claims, “experience nighttime driving like never before […] ensure your safety as well as other road users”, in ads (c) and (d) created the impression that LED bulbs could legally be fitted to vehicles with halogen headlamp units. We considered that the repeated references in the ads to nighttime driving, road markings and hazards gave the impression that those products were generally legal for use on public roads in the UK. The MOT inspection manual for cars and passenger vehicles stated that existing halogen headlamp units on vehicles first used on or after 1 April 1986 must not be converted to be used with high intensity discharge (HID) or light emitting diode (LED) bulbs. If such a conversion had been done, the headlamp would be failed for “light source and lamp not compatible”. That section did not appear in the inspection manual for motorcycles. Although that meant HID and LED conversion kits were road legal in the UK when fitted to motorcycles, or vehicles first used before 1 April 1986, we understood that in the majority of cases the kits would not be road legal. We considered that most consumers would not have been aware of the legality of using HID and LED conversion kits and that they risked their vehicle failing an MOT test if it was fitted with one. Although we acknowledged that ads (b) and (d) contained information on the legality of the product, we considered the location of that information within a table under a tab titled “techy stuff” was not sufficiently prominent. We also considered that qualifications contradicted the overall impression of ads (b) and (d) that the products were generally suitable for use on the road. Because the ads created the impression that HID and LED conversion kits were road legal in the UK, when that was not the case for the majority of vehicles, we concluded they were misleading. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 3.9 (Qualification). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. As already outlined, we considered the ads created the impression that these products could be used on the road to improve nighttime driving experience and improve visibility, with no restrictions on their use. We understood that cars fitted with HID and LED conversion kits, were not road legal, other than in limited circumstances, and consumers who used them risked fines and their vehicle failing an MOT test. Because the overall impression from the ads was that it was legal to use HID and LED conversion kits on public roads when that was not the case, and risked causing consumers to inadvertently break the law, we concluded the ads were socially irresponsible. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told ABD Supplies Ltd t/a ABD.co.uk to ensure future ads were not misleading or irresponsible by suggesting that HID and LED conversion kits could be used by most vehicles on public roads. We also told them to ensure their ads made clear that the use of HID and LED conversion kits was only legal when fitted to motorcycles, and to cars first used before 1 April 1986, or when used for off road purposes.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/abd-supplies-ltd-a25-1277053-abd-supplies-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on FX Compared Ltd t/a FXcompared,"Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ad and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code . Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website for FXcompared, www.fxcompared.com, an international money transfer comparison site, seen on 7 March 2024, included large text on the homepage that stated, “Compare the best international money transfer companies”. Text underneath stated “Compare transfer fees and exchange rates to find the best deal to send money overseas. We’ve done all the hard work to find the best money transfer companies from around the world so you can save up to 90% on fees and charges versus using your bank”. Small text underneath stated “FXcompared.com is an independent & Unbiased service […]”. The page included a money transfer calculator. Under a button labelled “COMPARE NOW”, text stated “Results are ranked in order of the best overall deal, taking into account transfer times, rates, fees, and customer service”. The page also included further information on three money transfer companies and the benefits of using FX Compared to compare money transfer companies. Using the money transfer calculator, on the results page for sending £10,000 from the UK to the USA, under the heading “Top 3 Money Transfer Providers for UK to USA”, there was information for each of the providers about the “Amount Received”, “Fee”, “Exchange Rate”, “Speed” and a button labelled “more…”. Further down the page, under the heading “Top 9 Money Transfer Providers”, text stated, “Latest prices for transferring money from UK to USA Exchange Rates as of 6 March 2024, 10:51” and included further information on the comparative benefits of FX Compared in comparison to banks. Small text in the footer of the page stated, “FXcompared.com is an fx money comparison site for international money transfer and to compare rates from currency brokers for sending money abroad […]”.","The Transparency Task Force, who believed that FXcompared had commercial relationships with the money transfer companies referenced in the ad, challenged whether:","1. FXC Intelligence, FX Compared Ltd t/a FXcompared’s sister company, tracked the cost of sending money internationally from banks across the globe. FXcompared had been collecting that data every month and more recently, in some cases, every day, for the UK since 2015 and for other markets also for many years. They provided two examples of that data. Their methodology was clearly stated in detail on the website and was easily accessible either from the results pages or the menu bar at the top of the website. The data was updated monthly which was faster than the rate of change of the underlying data (typically only a few times a year) and could be easily verified by a consumer simply asking a bank for their price or viewing it on a bank’s website. When they first launched FXcompared they received advice from the CAP Copy Advice team, who advised them that the methods and presentation would likely be acceptable. They had not changed the methods since then. The data on the comparison of bank pricing was also covered by leading press at the time, as it had not previously been a focus of reporting. They said they would amend the claim “saved vs the banks” to “potential saving vs. bank average”. They further amended “Average of Example High Street Bank Rates” to “an average from a group of major UK high street banks for this past month”, which they said added clarity. In addition, they updated the text listing the banks they used to form the average, to remove a small number that had not been included for some time. 2. FXcompared helped individuals and consumers understand the international money transfer sector. Traditionally, banks and physical cash agents had been the only businesses serving the industry but subsequently a number of independent companies were created in the sector. FXcompared focused on the part of the market for higher-end consumers and small businesses – for example, purchasing overseas property, buying luxury goods or making an overseas investment. There were approximately 11,000 different comparison results pages on the FXcompared website for the various combinations of sending money from one country to another. They did not hide that they had commercial relationships with some of the listed providers. At the top of every page was a clear “How we make money / Advertising Disclosure”, which opened a pop-up which clearly stated that there may have been commercial relationships and that not all providers may have been included. However, following the complaint, they found that 10 pages, out of the 11,000, that had a new format had accidentally deleted the advertising disclosure due to a one-off technological error. They had corrected those 10 pages so that the disclosure was clearly displayed. They provided details of the relationships they had with those listed on their website. They said they had also updated the text and increased the size of the ‘How we make money/Advertising Disclosure’ label on the results pages to say ‘FXcompared earns fees from some of the listings below. Learn more’, with the ‘learn more’ text still linked to a further explanation. They had also added a label to all the individual company results where FXcompared usually earn a fee, which said ‘FXcompared may earn fees from this listing. Learn more’ and provided a link to the same information. 3. FXcompared said there were hundreds of companies capable of providing an international money transfer service, many of them were physical cash agents or small money transfer companies, but they were not able to serve the higher value consumers FXcompared targeted as they were not able to accept large value transfers in cash. Only a small number of international money transfer companies had been around for over 10 years and had the scale and breadth of service that warranted being included on FXcompared. The companies included on the FXcompared website were virtually all of the leading companies and accounted for an estimated 80% to 90% of such international money transfer companies globally, which therefore made them representative of the industry. Some players were not included because they had not met the quality criteria; for example, they had a lack of trust, slow speed, poor service or did not offer risk products. Other products, such as being able to mitigate currency risk, work with a large trusted financial services company/brand or have an accredited FX expert available to speak to, brought the number of companies down to just a small number. They checked feedback from visitors who were referred to providers, and had, in the past, taken the decision to remove some providers where there had been issues. That, in particular, related to a number of smaller providers FXcompared worked with. They previously included a service that allowed website visitors to identify agent locations near them. It was not possible to provide any pricing information on those agents as that service was only available in-person and therefore not suitable to include on a digital service comparison website. The service had very little traffic and so FXcompared decided to remove it. They believed that supported that this specific type of provider was not of meaningful relevance to their audience. They did not use the claim “the best” to make any lowest price claims or promises as many factors such as speed of transfer, customer service and fees, which were taken into account for a provider. Information was shared with visitors to make their own decision about which provider was best for them. The default order results appeared on the search page and was based on the “FXcompared ranking” which used an algorithm that took into account the “FXcompared rating” (their review of the company) and the amount received for a transfer (the price). They only had one rating per company, but the price for each company differed based on the currency or the amount sent. Their ranking algorithm produced an order that combined the two factors, and rotated the top few results so that a visitor would see these in a different order if they refreshed the page. This rotation typically only impacted the top three to four rated companies, which were virtually always also ranked at the top according to price. There were also options to reorder the results to sort either by price or company rating. They confirmed they had removed the following claims from the homepage; “Compare the best international money transfer companies”, “We’ve done all the hard work to find the best money transfer companies from around the world so you can save up to 90% on fees and charges versus using your bank”, “FXcompared.com is an independent & Unbiased service” and “Results are ranked in order of the best overall deal, taking into account transfer times, rates, fees, and customer service”. In addition, “Make the best money transfer choices before you send money internationally, with FXcompared” had been amended to “See options from a selection of trusted money transfer providers before you send money internationally, with FXcompared. Compare money transfer companies by choosing a destination country, preferred routes and offered currency rates”. They believed the updated text clarified that they were comparing a specific group of providers. They said they had further added to the homepage the text “FXcompared shows you options from a range of providers specialising in reliable, high-value money transfers, some of which we earn a fee from. Learn more” and increased the size of the text. They believed that, along with the amended subheading, meant the homepage clarified their focus on high-value digital money transfers. They confirmed that they had also amended the claims “Top 3 Money Transfer Providers for UK to USA” and “Top 9 Money Transfer Providers” to “Our Top 3 Digital Money Transfer Providers for UK to USA” and “Our Top 9 Digital Money Transfer Providers”. They said that this better reflected that it was their selection, and that they focused on digital money transfer services.","On the results page for sending £10,000 from the UK to the USA, alongside each result listing was the total amount in US dollars for the “amount received” and a figure in sterling for the amount “saved vs. banks”. The ASA considered that consumers would understand that to mean that if they were to complete their international money transfer with one of the money transfer companies listed in the results, then, for those with a saving listed, it would cost them that specific amount less to transfer using that provider than it would if they used a bank. Further down the result listings, one of the providers listed was “Rate From The Average UK High Street Bank”, which included information that explained that the quotes from the money transfer providers showed the typical saving that could be made compared to banks, that the quote was an “actual quote of the average from UK banks” for that month, and that it included major and small banks and listed some of the banks that were included in that. There was an “amount received” in US dollars alongside that, and we understood that the “saved vs. banks” claims were based on the difference between that figure and the figure for the individual money transfer companies. We reviewed the average bank pricing data they provided which related to two separate months of data for transferring £100,000 in US dollars and two separate months of data for transferring £10,000. For the £100,000 transfer, nine banks were included in the results, which we considered was insufficient to account for all major and small banks in the UK. Notwithstanding that, the banks referenced in the pricing data did not match those referenced in the ad. Furthermore, the data was based on transferring £100,000, whereas the amount in the ad was for £10,000, and the range in the ‘Median Received Amount’ between the banks was over $3,700, which indicated that there was significant variation in the amount being charged by banks. The £10,000 transfer data related to December 2024 and January 2025 and post-dated for when the ad had been seen, by eight and nine months. Again, nine banks were included in the results and the banks referenced in the pricing data did not match those referenced in the ad. The range in the “amount received” between the banks was $221 which indicated there was still large variation in the amount being charged by banks, relative to the size of the amount transferred. Because there was a large variation in the amount different banks charged, we considered that the actual amount that a consumer could save by using a money transfer provider instead of a bank would vary widely depending on an individual bank’s rate and fees. We therefore considered that using an average from a range of banks as the basis to make a price comparison was misleading. We acknowledged the recent changes made by FX Compared to the wording of the ad. However, because the claim “saved vs. banks”, in the original ad, next to individual search results implied that it was an actual amount that would be saved by using that money transfer company compared to any bank, when it was in fact based on an average from a limited number of banks that had large variations in their rates and fees, we considered that the claim was misleading. For those reasons, we concluded that the saving claims had not been substantiated and were misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.17 (Price), 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors) and 3.39 (Price comparisons). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. As referenced at point 1, the result listings included an “amount saved vs. banks”. That information was calculated by FXcompared by using an average figure they had calculated based on the rates from a range of banks. It was not information provided by the individual money transfer providers. We understood that the default order for the result listings was ordered according to the “FXcompared ranking” which took into account the rating FXcompared gave to the company and the price for the transfer. One factor that was considered as part of the rating was how a particular money transfer provider treated and paid their suppliers, partners and affiliates, which included their relationship with the FXcompared website. We further understood that FXcompared had financial arrangements in place with some of the money transfer companies that appeared in the results listings on their website. Those companies were required to pay a fee for successful referrals arranged by FXcompared. We therefore considered that the companies they had financial relationships with may be assessed differently to the companies they recommended where there was no financial arrangement, with regards to the way they treated and paid FXcompared, and this could have an impact on their overall rating and, therefore, their ranking in the result listings. Whilst having a financial arrangement did not guarantee a money transfer provider would appear in a preferential position within the result listings, we nonetheless considered they were ads for the purposes of the CAP Code. We then considered whether those results were obviously identifiable as marketing communications and whether the commercial intent was made clear. There was nothing alongside the result listings for the money transfer providers they had a financial arrangement with that made it clear to consumers that FXcompared would receive a fee from successful referrals. We noted FXcompared’s comment that, by error, the ad did not include their “How we make money / Advertising Disclosure” label, and that they had since amended the website so that all results pages included it. The label opened a pop-up box that included information that FXcompared had financial arrangements with some of the money transfer providers. We considered it was not clear from that text which of the money transfer providers it was referring to. Furthermore, the label appeared in small lettering which could be easily overlooked and therefore a consumer could go through the process of comparing and selecting a money transfer provider without seeing this information. While we acknowledged the recent changes made by FX Compared, because of the absence of any prominent identifiers alongside the individual listings or another clear and prominent communication outlining which specific results were ads, when the ad was originally seen, we considered that they did not make clear upfront their commercial intent. We concluded they were not obviously identifiable as marketing communications. The ads therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications). The website home page included claims such as “Compare the best international money transfer companies”, “We’ve done all the hard work to find the best money transfer companies from around the world so you can save up to 90% on fees and charges versus using your bank”, “FXcompared.com is an independent & Unbiased service”, “Results are ranked in order of the best overall deal, taking into account transfer times, rates, fees, and customer service”, and “Make the best money transfer choices before you send money internationally, with FXcompared”. The results page included the headings “Top 3 Money Transfer Providers for UK to USA” and “Top 9 Money Transfer Providers” and provided information on a selection of money transfer providers. We considered that consumers would understand from the overall impression of the ad that FXcompared were an independent comparison website whereby they could compare companies to send money abroad. The providers they were shown would be based on the individuals’ specific requirements and would be ranked based on objective criteria that took into account how long the providers took to transfer the money, their rate, fee and quality of customer service. The providers they were recommended were the best compared to most, if not all, other providers available on the market. We noted FXcompared’s comment that they dealt with higher value transfers and therefore not all providers, in particular those including physical cash agents and small money transfer companies, who did not accept large transfer values in cash, were relevant to them. However, in the absence of information in the ad explaining that, we considered because the overall impression of the ad was that FXcompared provided a comprehensive comparison of all international money transfer providers, consumers would not be aware that the recommendations for the “top providers” were based on a comparison against a small, limited number of providers, and not all those available on the full market. As referenced at point 2, due to an error, the results page did not include their “How we make money / Advertising Disclosure” label, which stated “FXcompared does not include the entire universe of available international money transfer companies”. Notwithstanding the points made above that the label appeared in small text which could be easily overlooked, we also considered that consumers would be unaware from the label that they could find information about the scope of the providers that were included in the comparison. Furthermore, we understood that the market, when including physical cash agents and small money transfer companies, included hundreds of providers. However, FXcompared only included a very small proportion of the market in their comparison, and we therefore considered that consumers would be unaware from that information that only a limited number of providers were included in the comparison. The homepage also did not include any such messaging. We acknowledged the recent changes made by FX Compared. However, because the overall impression of the ad, when it originally was seen, was that FXcompared provided a comprehensive comparison of all international money transfer providers, when in fact they only included a small number of providers from a limited sector of the market, we concluded that the claims “best” and “top providers” were misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told FX Compared Ltd t/a FXcompared not to imply that the international money transfer providers they recommended were the best or the top providers compared to all other providers if they only include providers from a limited sector of the market, and to ensure that future savings claims did not mislead. We also told them to ensure that where they received a fee from a money transfer provider, the result listing was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication and that the commercial intent was made clear.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/fx-compared-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Holiday Gems Ltd,"Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ad and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code .","A booking webpage for Holiday Gems, www.holidaygems.co.uk, seen in December 2024, featured confirmation details for a hotel and flights to Gran Canaria. Text stated, “Your Holiday Summary. Total Cost: £1740.73”.","The complainant, who had booked the holiday, but had subsequently been told the price stated in the ad was no longer available and that they would have to pay an additional £34, challenged whether the price claim was misleading.","Holiday Gems Ltd said that the ad should have included a qualification that it was a “from” price. They said that due to a technical error, the “from” price qualification had inadvertently been omitted from holiday listings when consumers accessed them via their internal website search tool. They said they would fix that error, which had occurred because their website had been redeveloped. Although Holiday Gems acknowledged that technical error, they believed their processes had provisions in place which made it explicitly clear that the advertised price was a quote that was subject to change. They said the ad was described as a “holiday summary” and not a “booking” and that customers had to accept their terms and conditions before proceeding on the website. They said the fact it was a summary and not a finalised booking was then communicated again to consumers via an email. Holiday Gems provided a copy of their terms and conditions for online bookings. The terms and conditions described how the booking process worked and stated that the claim on the website was a quoted price and not a confirmed booking. They said that consumers had the option to cancel if there was a change in price because no booking would have been completed before the finalised price was confirmed.","The ad was a booking page for a selected holiday and featured details such as the hotel, flights and dates. The ASA considered consumers would understand the price claim “Total Cost: £1740.73” to mean that amount was the total price that they would pay for that holiday, notwithstanding the cost of any optional extras. That particular price claim was repeated throughout the online booking process and when the complainant had their payment authorised. We did not consider that consumers were likely to interpret the claim as a quote that was subject to change. We understood the complainant was subsequently informed that the price had increased and that they were required to pay an additional £34 as well as an additional £4.95 transaction fee to complete the booking. We acknowledged that the claim in the ad was a quoted price for a particular holiday and not a confirmed booking. However, the fact that it was not a confirmed booking was not sufficient to avoid the price claim misleading consumers in the event that it was not available. We considered that contacting a consumer to request further payment once an online booking process had been completed would have rendered that quoted price claim misleading. Additionally, amending the price once a payment had been authorised, as we understood the complainant had done, would again have rendered the quoted price misleading. While we acknowledged that holiday prices available through third parties were liable to change, consumers should nevertheless have been able to rely on prices quoted to them when booking, and advertisers were responsible for ensuring that stated prices were genuine and did not mislead. Because the holiday was not available for the stated “Total Cost” in the ad, we concluded that the price claim was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (Prices).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Holiday Gems Ltd to ensure that their price claims were based on genuine prices available to consumers and to ensure they clearly stated that their prices were quotes that were subject to change.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/holiday-gems-ltd-a25-1273639-holiday-gems-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on 2XU UK Limited,"Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”).

Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ad and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code .","A paid-for Instagram ad for 2xu Recovery Compression Tights seen on 25 September 2024. The reel featured various shots of individuals training while wearing the tights, with superimposed text that stated, “The tights that help you recover faster”. The caption stated, “Recovery is training […] What does Recovery do for you? – Increase circulation. – Assist lymphatic drainage. – Ease muscle soreness. – Improve Blood Flow. – Reduce swelling. – Speed up muscle repair”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it made medical claims for an unlicensed product.,2XU UK Ltd t/a 2xu said that the product was not registered as a medical device because they did not believe the ad made medical claims. They believed that the product was marketed as an advanced recovery aid and they did not claim it was a treatment for medical conditions. They confirmed that the ad in question had since been removed and was no longer live.,"The CAP Code stated medicinal or medical claims and indications could only be made for a medicinal product that was licensed by the MHRA, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. In addition, the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 required that a medical device should be registered with the MHRA before it was placed on the market in Great Britain. The ad featured a number of claims, including “The tights that help you recover faster” and “What does Recovery do for you? […] increase circulation, assist lymphatic drainage, ease muscle soreness, improve blood flow, reduce swelling, speed up muscle repair”. The ASA considered the ad implied that the use of the Recovery Compression Tights could aid an individual’s recovery from exercise and alleviate symptoms, such as muscle soreness, swelling and reduce microtears. We therefore considered that the overall impression of the ad was that the Recovery Compression Tights could be used to treat or alleviate pain arising from physical exercise. We therefore considered that the ad made medical claims and therefore required that the product met the requirements for medical devices. We understood that the product was not registered with the MHRA, nor had we seen evidence that the Recovery Compression Tights had the appropriate conformity marking. Therefore, no medical claims could be made for the product. Because the ad made such claims, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.10 (Legality) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told 2XU UK Ltd t/a 2xu not to make medical claims for devices that did not hold the applicable conformity marking and were not registered with the MHRA.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/2xu-uk-limited-a24-1261881-2xu-pty-ltd.html

A link to the Beautyjenics website was included in the post.",The ASA challenged whether the ad was irresponsible because:,Beautyjenics Ltd did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Beautyjenics’ lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code required marketing communications to be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The ad was a promotion for “liquid BBLs” (Brazilian Butt Lift) and other cosmetic procedures. We understood that a liquid BBL involved the injection of dermal filler into the bottom to enhance its volume and shape. We understood from guidance from the Joint Council for Cosmetic Procedures that liquid BBLs were considered to be surgical procedures, which carried a level of risk. We considered that, although it would not have necessarily been irresponsible to offer promotions for procedures, marketers would need to take particular care when administering them. Undertaking cosmetic surgery should have been portrayed as a decision that required time and thought from consumers before proceeding, because of the risks involved. The ad stated “MANCHESTER… LIMITED SPACE AVAILABLE 14TH -16TH OCTOBER” and “Don’t miss this exclusive opportunity to get that perfect peachy look”. We considered that consumers would have understood that there was a time-limited opportunity to book the procedure, and the number of appointments available was finite. The ad also stated that the procedure was “highly-sought-after”, which implied it would likely sell out quickly. We considered those claims created undue emphasis on the promotions limited timeframe and were likely to have led consumers to fear they would miss out on the offer if they had not booked quickly. In that context, we considered that consumers could have been rushed into making a decision to have cosmetic surgery without taking sufficient time to consider the consequences. Because the ad created a sense of undue urgency to book a cosmetic procedure quickly, we considered that it had not been prepared in a socially responsible manner and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility). CAP Guidance on cosmetic interventions stated that marketers should not play on consumers’ insecurities or exaggerate the likely outcome of the intervention for the average consumer. The ad included the claim “get that perfect peachy look!” which we understood was targeted at women and implied they could change their body shape through cosmetic surgery. The ad also featured before-and-after images of a woman’s bottom, and the claim “WHO’S READY FOR REAL RESULTS?”. We understood that the actual end result would depend on a variety of factors and considered that the claims created unrealistic expectations of what could have been achieved from the surgery. We therefore considered the ad risked exploiting women’s insecurities around body image, particularly those with insecurities relating to their body shape. Because the ad exploited women’s insecurities around body image and created unrealistic expectations about the results of cosmetic procedures, we concluded that it was irresponsible. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility). CAP Guidance on cosmetic interventions stated that marketers should not trivialise such procedures or suggest they could be undertaken lightly, because it was likely that all such interventions would carry some level of risk to the patient, such as infections. It was therefore important that marketers presented such procedures responsibly in their advertising. The ad stated that the procedure involved a liquid BBL with different quantities of filler, which would be injected into the bottom. The ad included the claims “WHO’S READY FOR REAL RESULTS?” and “Don’t miss this exclusive opportunity to get that perfect peachy look”. We considered those claims presented the decision to book the procedure as exciting, with a focus on the perceived positive results of the procedure and no reference to the risks involved. That created the impression that the decision to book the procedure was not a serious one. Moreover, the emphasis on the “exclusive” and time limited nature of the offer portrayed the decision to book the cosmetic procedure as one that needed to be taken quickly to avoid missing out. In that context, the ad portrayed the decision to have cosmetic surgery as one that could have been taken without proper consideration and quickly to capitalise on a promotional offer. Because the ad detracted from the seriousness of the decision to undertake a cosmetic intervention, we concluded that it trivialised the risks of the surgery and was socially irresponsible. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

We considered the combination of the phrases “Black Friday Bomb Deals”, “up to 70% off”, “Valid until 30th November” and “YOU DON’T WANT TO MISS THESE DEALS” created undue emphasis on the promotion’s limited timeframe.

The ad portrayed the Black Friday offer as something which needed to be acted on quickly in order to capitalise on a lower price or “deal” which may not be available again due to the limited timeframe. The ad failed to highlight that there were risks involved in any cosmetic procedure, and it created the impression that a low price or promotional offer was the most important factor when making the decision to book a cosmetic procedure.

They said that they would ensure that any future advertising would not use layouts and fonts that could lead to confusion.,"The ASA considered that the image used in the ad appeared to be a screenshot of a web page on the GOV.UK website detailing eligibility for making a claim in relation to diesel emissions. This was due to the use of the same typography, the black and white colour scheme, and simple layout. The layout included the placement of links to other pages at the top, and a section to the right-hand side with the partially visible heading “Related c” and further links underneath, as on GOV.UK web pages. We considered that these elements were distinctively associated with the GOV.UK website and therefore would give consumers the impression that the company “The Claims Guide” was officially approved, endorsed or authorised by the Government to help consumers make diesel emission claims. This impression was further reinforced by the sentence in the screenshot which stated that eligibility “should be checked using the official reg checker"", and the invitations to check eligibility on the website to which the ad linked. We considered the ad therefore presented The Claims Guide’s website as the Government’s “official” registration checker. Because the ad implied that The Claims Guide was approved, endorsed or authorised by the UK Government, and that was not the case, we concluded that it was misleading.

We considered that the purpose of the question in the ad “Doing Dry January?” was to target and engage consumers who had taken part in the campaign. We further considered that the text “Doing Dry January?” alongside the claim “One won’t hurt, right?” would have been understood by those consumers as encouraging them to drink alcohol, even though they were taking a break from drinking, likely for health-related reasons. Although we acknowledged that the tone of the ad was light-hearted, we considered the phrase “one won’t hurt” was closely associated with peer pressure and relapse during abstinence and was often used to persuade someone to drink alcohol against their better judgement. We also considered the claim “keep the party going into January” suggested that without alcohol the festivity of parties typically associated with December, such as Christmas events and New Year’s Eve, would not carry on into January, whereas by purchasing a 70 cl bottle of VK, the “partying” could continue. We considered the ad implied that, without alcohol, January was boring in contrast to the parties and social occasions which often involved alcohol in December, and that continuing to drink alcohol could overcome such boredom. We considered that the fundamental purpose of the ad was to tempt consumers taking part in Dry January to drink alcohol in order to “keep the party going” and avoid the boredom they would otherwise experience due to abstinence. We therefore concluded that the ad implied that drinking alcohol could overcome boredom, particularly for those who were taking part in Dry January, and it was socially irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 18.1 and 18.6 (Alcohol).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Global Brands Ltd t/a VK to ensure that their ads were socially responsible and did not imply that drinking alcohol could overcome boredom, particularly when referencing Dry January.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/global-brands-ltd-a25-1276576-global-brands-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Groupe SEB UK Ltd t/a Tefal,"Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ad and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code .","A product page for a set of pans on the Tefal website www.tefal.co.uk, seen on 5 February 2025, stated “£139.99 SAVE £190.01 Was: £330.00”. The ad featured images of the product with the superimposed text “RED HOT DEAL”. Underneath the images was further information, including an email icon next to the claim “SIGN UP FOR 15% OFF”. Clicking on the icon revealed a pop-up box with the text “Sign up for 15% off. That’s right… signup and SAVE, instantly! T&Cs apply, excludes Clearance. Minimum spend applies. Subscribe to our email Newsletter and receive 15% off your first purchase from the Tefal online shop”.","The complainant, who was unable to use the 15% discount offer against the advertised product, challenged whether the ad was misleading.","Groupe SEB UK Ltd t/a Tefal stated that text in the pop-up box should have included a disclaimer which stated that “Red Hot Deals” were excluded from the 15% discount promotion. They said they had updated the text to read “T&Cs apply, excludes Red Hot Deals & Clearance offers”. Tefal highlighted that “Red Hot Deals” were excluded from the 15% discount offer, and this was stated on their website’s landing page and in an email that consumers received upon sign-up. During the ASA’s investigation, Tefal stated that they had removed the claim “15% off” from the product pages on their website and replaced it with the text “Subscribe for deals”.","The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “SIGN UP FOR 15% OFF”, which was on the product page for a set of pans, to mean that if they signed up to Tefal, they would receive a 15% discount that could be used on that product. Whilst consumers might have expected there to have been some exclusions when using a discount offer, we considered the use of the claim on that page strongly implied that it could be used on the pans. We further considered the positioning of the “SIGN UP” icon directly underneath images of the product reinforced that impression. However, we understood that the offer was not valid to be used on the pans because it was a “Red Hot Deal”, which was a separate promotion offered by Tefal. Because the 15% discount offer could not be applied, we considered the promotion should not have featured on the product pages for “Red Hot Deal” items. We acknowledged that Tefal said they would amend the pop-up box that appeared when the “SIGN UP” icon was clicked to state that “Red Hot Deals” were excluded from the discount offer. However, we considered that the discount offer itself should not have appeared if it could not be used against the advertised product, as this was likely to cause confusion. We acknowledged that the “Red Hot Deals” landing page on the Tefal website featured the text “These deals are already too hot to handle… so discount codes are not valid for these products”. However, it was possible for consumers to have accessed the individual product page for the pans without viewing the “Red Hot Deals” landing page. We therefore considered that the inclusion of that information on the landing page was insufficient to override the impression created by the ad that the 15% discount offer could be used on the set of pans. Because the ad suggested a 15% discount offer could have been applied to the advertised product when that was not the case, we concluded that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Montdog Ltd t/a Wild Pack,"Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ads and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code . Summary of Council decision: Four issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","Two posts for dogfood company Wild Pack, on their Instagram page jointhewildpack, seen in October 2024: a. The post featured a video of Geogia Toffolo, the owner of Wild Pack. The video began with Ms Toffolo stating, “Let me tell you a tale of canines, kibble and corruption”, as images of dogs, dog food and money appeared on-screen. She continued, “I discovered an industry rotten to the core when I entered the shadowy world of dog food. Where a thinly veiled cartel used their position of power to drown out the voice of over 40,000 dog lovers […] Here’s what the UK petfood industry doesn’t want you to know”, before explaining how she applied for Wild Pack to join UK Pet Food, the trade association for pet food manufacturers and suppliers, but her application was rejected. She said this was because she had recently launched a campaign to ban glycotoxins in dog food, which were “harmful chemicals that lead to cancer, diabetes, kidney failure in ultra processed kibble”. The video showed a clip of Ms Toffolo on a call with UK Pet Food in which she was told that “the executive committee say that would be breaking our code of conduct”. She said, “UK pet food is funded by member fees, with the largest companies paying up to £2 million each year. And who are the largest most influential members? Surprise, surprise – it’s these guys.” The brand logos of Nestle Purina, Mars Incorporated and Colgate-Palmolive appeared on-screen. She said, “From now on I will refer to them only as The Kibble Cartel” as an image of a well-known known drug lord, the text “TH£ KIBBL£ CART£L” and the same brand logos used previously appeared on-screen. She continued, “The Kibble Cartel controls the whole supply chain, from production to regulation. And what’s worse is the sheer number of vets on the payroll of these huge companies. Some vets are said to be paid up to £30,000 to promote kibble. So next time you get nutrition advice from your vet, check first if they are on the cartel’s payroll,” She described “The Kibble Cartel” as the “judge, jury and executioner” and concluded that “they want you to believe they protect your pet’s safety. But in reality, they safeguard large-scale corporate profit. We can’t let this happen.” The post’s caption included similar claims. b. The second post opened with a clip of Georgia Toffolo talking about “The Kibble Cartel”. She stated that “The Kibble Cartel love to tell you big lies on their packaging. Just have a look at this Bakers product from Purina”. An image of one of their products appeared on-screen. She talked about claims stated on the packaging: “This says 100% tender chunks. It says beef in big capital letters. But have a closer look at the ingredients on the back.” An image of the ingredients list appeared on-screen as she stated “This product is actually less than 1% beef. It also says it’s made with country vegetables. Actually, no, it’s another lie. It’s actually made with derivatives of vegetable origin. This means it’s actually just a bulking agent […]”. She then showed a Beta product from Purina. She said, “It says ‘Made with natural ingredients’. ‘Chicken number one ingredient’. These are yet more misleading labels as this is only 28% chicken meal” and that chicken meal “[…] can legally be made from animals which are already dead, dying or diseased.” A video of what appeared to be a meat factory appeared in the background. The caption included the following text: “The Kibble Cartel can be very creative with their language. Whether they’re referring to powdered carcasses as ‘beef’ or UHT bulking agents as ‘country vegetables’, they’re pretty liberal with their terminology.”","The complainant, a canine nutritionist, challenged whether the following claims were misleading and could be substantiated:",,"The ASA considered consumers would interpret the claim in ad (a), stating “[…] vets are said to be paid up to £30,000 to promote kibble”, as suggesting that members of the trade body UK Pet Food were financially incentivising vets to recommend certain pet food brands. Ms Toffolo further advised consumers “next time you get nutrition advice from your vet, check first if they are on the cartel’s payroll” which we considered reinforced that impression. However, the advertiser provided no evidence to support the claim. We therefore concluded that the claim had not been substantiated and was therefore misleading. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). Ad (a) featured the claim that glycotoxins in “ultra processed” kibble “lead to cancer, diabetes, kidney failure”. We considered consumers would understand the claim to mean that kibble (dry dogfood) contained levels of glycotoxins that posed significant health risks to dogs, potentially leading to chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and kidney failure. Additionally, we considered it would encourage dog owners to seek alternative foods. We assessed the evidence provided by Wildpack. The first document was an abstract from a PhD thesis. We were not provided with a full copy of the paper or a published version and considered that abstracts alone were not adequate substantiation for advertising claims. In any case, we understood the paper evaluated how differently processed diets influenced the faecal microbiota in healthy dogs, but did not investigate the possible negative impacts on health. We therefore understood the full paper also would not have been adequate to support the claim. The second document was a literature review, published in a peer-reviewed journal. It evaluated the effect on nutritive value and pet health caused by the ‘Maillard reaction’ in pet food processing. The Maillard reaction was a chemical reaction that could occur in foods cooked at high temperatures, which reduced the bioavailability of amino acids. The paper concluded that significant proportions of the amino acid lysine in pet foods could be modified by the reaction and may be unavailable for metabolism by dogs and cats. However, it also concluded that further study was needed to determine if this could lead to diseases such as diabetes and impaired renal function in pets. The study, published in a peer-reviewed journal, examined the correlation between dietary intake of Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs) and their urinary excretion in dogs and cats. Data was collected in relation to a group of dogs fed raw food, and a group fed dry processed food, using spot urine sampling and questionnaires. The study concluded that dogs primarily fed raw food with a low intake of dietary AGEs had significantly lower concentrations of free-form AGEs in their urine compared to those fed processed food. However, the study did not investigate the effects of these dietary differences on pet health. Regarding the two further abstracts from published research papers, one paper suggested a possible role of AGEs in the development of canine atherosclerosis (a condition where the arteries became narrowed and hardened due to the build-up of plaque on the artery walls) in three dogs. The second paper examined the AGE distribution in the cerebellum and brainstem of 18 dogs. Because full studies were not submitted, and the sample sizes used or referred to were too small for results to be extrapolated to the wider population, we considered that they did not constitute adequate substantiation for the advertising claim. We considered that while some of the evidence indicated that some levels of glycotoxins were present in “ultra processed” kibble, they did not indicate that they posed significant health risks to dogs, including that they could “lead to cancer, diabetes, kidney failure”. We concluded that the claims had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). We considered that consumers would interpret the claim “chicken meal can legally be made from animals which are already dying, dead, or diseased” in reference to a Purina product, to mean that specific product contained chicken meal made from dead, dying and diseased animals. We further considered they would understand it more generally to imply that ingredients in most pet foods in the UK were of lower quality and potentially harmful to their pets' health. This impression was further reinforced by the inclusion of a video depicting what appeared to be a meat factory in the background as Ms Toffolo made this claim. The advertiser did not provide any evidence to substantiate the claim, either specifically in relation to the named Purina product or more generally to pet foods in the UK. While we acknowledged Wildpack's comment about the relevance of overseas practices to the UK, we noted that they were a UK based business selling to customers in the UK, with their ads directed at a UK audience. The claims in question focused on two products sold within the UK, which viewers of the videos would have reasonably understood to relate specifically to UK practices. Consequently, it was necessary to substantiate these claims with evidence relevant to the UK. Therefore, we concluded the claim “chicken meal can legally be made from animals which are already dying, dead, or diseased” in ad (b) had not been substantiated and was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not discredit or denigrate another product or marketer. The rule applied irrespective of whether or not a claim was true, if it appeared in a comparative advertisement and was expressed in terms which were insulting, derogatory or demeaning. Ads which included comparisons with competitors which went beyond a robust and objective comparison of their products or services risked breaching that rule. In ad (a), Ms Toffolo characterised the UK pet food industry as “corrupt”, a “shadowy world” and “rotten to the core.” She described UK Pet Food as a “thinly veiled cartel” and “the judge, jury, and executioner”, and specifically highlighted that its member companies included Nestlé Purina, Mars Incorporated, and Colgate-Palmolive. The ad repeatedly referred to them collectively as the “Kibble Cartel,” and emphasised this depiction of them by displaying an image of the drug cartel leader Pablo Escobar. It suggested that these entities prioritised corporate profitability over the safety of pets, including by paying vets to promote products which were implied to be nutritionally inadequate, and that they used their position of power to “drown out the voice of over 40,000 dog lovers”. Ad (b) also referred to UK Pet Food and its members as “The Kibble Cartel”. It was also stated that the “Kibble Cartel” told “lies” and included “misleading labels” on their packaging. We considered that ads (a) and (b) went beyond objective comparison, instead criticising UK Pet Food and its members in a way that suggested they were secretive, corrupt, dishonest and engaging in illegal behaviour. We concluded that the ads denigrated UK Pet Food, Nestlé Purina, Mars Incorporated and Colgate-Palmolive, and therefore breached the Code. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.35 (Comparisons with Identifiable Competitors) and 3.42 (Imitation and Denigration).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Montdog Ltd t/a Wildpack to ensure their future ads did not claim that other pet food products posed significant health risks or led to chronic diseases unless they held adequate substantiation. We also told them not to claim that vets were paid to promote dog food by UK Pet Food or its members, unless they held adequate substantiation. We told them not to make claims about the provenance of ingredients in other pet food products unless they held adequate substantiation. We further told them to ensure their ads did not discredit or denigrate UK Pet Food, Nestle Purina, Mars Incorporated, Colgate-Palmolive or their other competitors’ products.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/montdog-ltd-a24-1265514-montdog-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on NKD Medical Ltd t/a Dr Ducu London,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ads for liquid BBLs (Brazilian Butt Lifts), identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”).

Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Instagram ad for Dr. Ducu, a cosmetic treatment provider, seen in November 2024. The ad featured a carousel of images with text that stated, “BLACK FRIDAY 11TH TO 30TH NOVEMBER”. One of the images included text that stated NON SURGICAL DBL 40% OFF BOOK NOW”. A caption stated, “Safe and effective, our treatments come with no downtime and minimal discomfort. Your safety, comfort and trust are our top priorities”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad was irresponsible because:,,"The CAP Code required marketing communications to be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The ad was a Black Friday promotion for “liquid BBLs” (Brazilian Butt Lift) and other cosmetic procedures. It promoted a Double Butt Lift (DBP) procedure, which we understood was a very similar procedure to a BBL. We understood that a liquid BBL involved the injection of dermal filler into the bottom to enhance its volume and shape. We understood from guidance from the Joint Council for Cosmetic Procedures that liquid BBLs were considered to be surgical procedures, which carried a level of risk. We considered that, although it would not have necessarily been irresponsible to offer promotions for procedures, marketers would need to take particular care when administering them. Undertaking cosmetic surgery should be portrayed as a decision that required time and thought from consumers before proceeding, because of the risks involved. We understood that “Black Friday” referred to a specific day in the year when many businesses offered promotions. Because promotions often only lasted for several days or weeks around that day, we considered consumers would understand references to Black Friday to mean that the opportunity to take up the offer was time limited. We considered the phrases “BLACK FRIDAY 11TH TO 30TH NOVEMBER” and “NON SURGICAL DBL 40% OFF” created undue emphasis on the limited time frame of the promotion. We considered that was likely to lead consumers to fear that they would miss out on the offer if they did not book quickly. In that context, we considered that consumers could be rushed into making a decision to have cosmetic surgery without taking sufficient time to consider the consequences. Because the ad created a sense of undue urgency to book a cosmetic procedure quickly, we considered that it had not been prepared in a socially responsible manner and therefore breached the Code. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility). CAP Guidance on cosmetic interventions stated that marketers should not trivialise such procedures or suggest they could be undertaken lightly, because it was likely that all such interventions would carry some level of risk to the patient, such as infections. It was therefore important that marketers presented such procedures responsibly in their advertising. The ad referenced a number of cosmetic procedures, including liquid BBLs, alongside the claim “Safe and effective, our treatments come with no downtime and minimal discomfort”. The ad focused on the end results shown in the photo and the 40% off Black Friday promotion. We considered that gave the overall impression that there were minimal medical risks or pain involved in the DBL procedure. We considered that the ad’s focus on potential price savings and the stated safety and “minimal discomfort” of the procedure created a trivial tone which detracted from the seriousness of the procedure. That impression was further added to by the claims that consumers should act quickly so that they didn’t miss out. Overall, the ad implied that the decision to have the DBL procedure was one that could be taken lightly and quickly without consideration of the risks involved. Because the ad detracted from the seriousness of the decision to undertake a cosmetic intervention, we concluded that it trivialised the risks of the surgery and was socially irresponsible. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Pressplay Ltd,"Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”).

DRIVE SAFER AT NIGHT! ANTI-GLARE & POLARISED DRIVING GLASSES HELP PREVENT DANGEROUS HEADLIGHT, AND LOW-SUN GLARE.” Beneath that was an image of a road with oncoming traffic with headlights on. The left-hand side of the image was titled “BEFORE” and showed glare coming from the headlights. The right-hand side titled “AFTER” showed a clearer image with the car headlights dimmed. Further text on the left-hand image said “DRIVE IN COMFORT. NO MORE BLINDING LIGHTS”. Text beneath the image stated “Whether you’re driving during the day or night, our anti-glare driving glasses are designed to reduce eye strain and enhance visibility, ensuring a safer, more comfortable driving experience.","The complainant, who understood that wearing anti-glare glasses did not assist driving at night, challenged whether the ad was misleading.","Pressplay Ltd said the glasses were specifically designed to make them optimally effective for night driving. The lenses were made with tri-acetate cellulose (TAC) which was known for its high optical clarity and durability. They were polarised and had coatings designed to reduce glare and filter harmful blue light in the 380–500 nm range, which was a particular challenge for nighttime driving. They explained that the glasses met UK standards for nighttime driving. Specifically, BS EN ISO 12312-1:2013 (A1:2015) for which they provided the certification report. That report showed the glasses achieved a luminous transmittance of 79.38%, exceeding the minimum requirement of 75% for driving at night. That ensured adequate light transmission for safe nighttime driving. In addition, regarding colour recognition: the glasses passed tests for recognising red, yellow and green signal lights under both incandescent and LED lighting conditions. That was with the exception of LED blue light, which they said was less critical for driving. The report explicitly stated that the glasses were suitable for ""Road Use and Driving in Twilight or Night"". They said further that the glasses passed similar standards in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. They also said that the use of polarised lenses gave specific advantages. That included glare reduction, where the polarised lenses filtered out horizontal light waves that caused glare from reflective surfaces (such as wet roads, car windshields and headlights). That meant the glasses were particularly effective at reducing distractions at night or in low light. By minimising glare, the glasses improved clarity of vision which assisted in viewing obstacles, road signs and lane markings. Polarised lenses also enhanced contrast, making objects more defined and vivid, which was particularly beneficial for driving in low light. Reduced glare decreased eye strain and tiredness, allowing for prolonged focus which was ideal for long drives. They explained that while traditional polarised lenses could limit visible light transmission, their glasses had a lightweight polarised film, and so they did not suffer from the same issue and allowed more light to enter the eye. Their lenses also offered complete blocking of UVA and UVB rays, which was essential for eye health and safety. They said all these factors contributed to safer driving by improving reaction times and reducing distractions. They explained further that their glasses were designed with ant-reflective coatings to prevent glare from artificial lights, such as headlights, and did not rely on light reduction alone. That made them distinct from sunglasses, which were designed to reduce sunlight intensity and as such were not always suitable for night driving. The anti-reflective coating on their glasses aimed to minimise glare without compromising overall light transmission. They enhanced rather impeded visibility, therefore, in low light conditions. They said the glasses also incorporated Nano Yellow Factor technology which permitted high light transmission and allowed for enhanced brightness and contrast. That technology filtered short-wavelength light (such as blue light) that could reduce visual contrast in low-light conditions. They explained that the combination of that technology, the anti-reflective coating and a lightweight polarised film reduced headlight glare by approximately 15.81%. They further sent a report from the manufacturer showing the testing that produced the 15.81% figure. They said that the claims regarding glare reduction, enhanced visibility and blue light filtering were substantiated by independent testing, which had been performed by an internationally recognised and ISO-certified laboratory, as well as other international standards being met. Those same tests showed the product exceeded the requirements for luminous transmittance, UV protection and signal light recognition. They said the ad did not claim to eliminate blue light completely but showed they reduced significant glare and therefore the claims made in the ad were accurate and responsible. They stated that many other retailers sold similar glasses with anti-blue light and polarised lenses and so they believed that demonstrated the widespread acceptance of the benefits of the products.","The ad stated “SAY GOODBYE TO GLARE AND HELLO TO CRYSTAL CLEAR VISION. DRIVE SAFER AT NIGHT! ANTI-GLARE & POLARISED DRIVING GLASSES HELP PREVENT DANGEROUS HEADLIGHT […] GLARE” and “Whether you’re driving during the day or night, our anti-glare driving glasses are designed to reduce eye strain and enhance visibility, ensuring a safer, more comfortable driving experience”. The ASA considered the text, alongside the “BEFORE” and “AFTER” images, with a clear “After” image of a car on the road, not obscured by headlights, was likely to be understood to mean that the product prevented or significantly diminished glare from headlights, and would contribute to increased safety when driving at night. Pressplay had supplied a copy of the certification report to show that the glasses had met the criteria for BS EN ISO 12312-1:2013 (A1:2015), relevant to the UK, and equivalent certification in the US, Australia and New Zealand. We understood that BS EN ISO 12312-1:2013 (A1:2015) was the legal certification that all sunglasses and related eyewear had to achieve to be sold in the UK. Glasses with a luminous transmittance of more than 75% could legally be used for driving at night. The report stated the glasses had a luminous transmittance of 79.38% and as such had passed for “Driving in Twilight or Night”. We acknowledged that the certification demonstrated that the glasses could legally be used at night for driving. However, the ad made claims that the glasses could “HELP PREVENT DANGEROUS HEADLIGHT […] GLARE” and “SAY GOODBYE TO GLARE”, provide “CRYSTAL-CLEAR VISION” and make the “DRIVE SAFER AT NIGHT”. Therefore, we understood that consumers would expect that the glasses provided benefits, regarding reducing headlight glare and increasing safety, beyond that provided by standard glasses, and that Pressplay would have evidence, in addition to the certification report, to substantiate those claims. Pressplay had provided an additional report from the manufacturer, rather than third-party independent testing, which stated that the use of lightweight polarised film for the product reduced headlight glare by approximately 15%. While the reduction of glare by 15% was notable, the commentary within the report did also state “specific effectiveness depends on the environment”. In addition, the ad claimed the product would “SAY GOODBYE TO GLARE AND HELLO TO CRYSTAL CLEAR VISION […] HELP PREVENT DANGEROUS HEADLIGHT[…] GLARE”. Therefore, because the ad implied a significant or complete removal of glare from headlights, and the manufacturer’s own testing showed it was only 15%, dependent on the environment, the evidence did not support the claims in the ad. For that reason, we concluded that the claims had not been substantiated and that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading Advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Pressplay Ltd not to state or imply that their driving glasses could prevent glare while driving and could make driving safer if they did not have evidence to support the claims.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/pressplay-ltd-a24-1266131-pressplay-ltd.html

Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad for Rejuvenate Clinics, a cosmetic treatment provider, seen on 19 November 2024. The ad featured a carousel of before and after images. Text below stated “BLACK FRIDAY NON SURGICAL BBL OFFERS. Sign up to get the discounted offer”. A caption stated “Achieve your body goals with 20% BLACK FRIDAY Discounts! Get instant results. Treat Hip Dips. Increase bum volume. Tailored treatment plan”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad was irresponsible because:,"Rejuvenate Academy Ltd t/a Rejuvenate Clinics said that they had not realised that their ad might have been in breach of the CAP Code. They said that they had reviewed ASA guidance and would remove all references to time-limited offers. To ensure they did not trivialise the risks of cosmetic procedures, they said that they would state in ads that the surgery was carried out by a medical professional with ultrasound to minimise risks and enhance safety. They believed this would have made consumers aware that there were risks involved. They said they would ensure future ads were compliant with the Code.","The CAP Code required marketing communications to be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The ad was a “Black Friday” promotion for ‘liquid BBLs’ (Brazilian Butt Lift) and other cosmetic procedures. We understood that a liquid BBL involved the injection of dermal filler into the bottom to enhance its volume and shape. We understood from guidance from the Joint Council for Cosmetic Procedures that liquid BBLs were considered to be surgical procedures, which carried a level of risk. We considered that, although it would not necessarily be irresponsible to offer promotions for procedures, marketers would need to take particular care when administering them. Undertaking cosmetic surgery should be portrayed as a decision that required time and thought from consumers before proceeding, because of the risks involved. We understood that Black Friday referred to a specific day in the year when many businesses offered promotions. Because promotions often only lasted for several days or weeks around that day, we considered consumers would understand references to Black Friday to mean that the opportunity to take up the offer was time limited. We considered the phrases “BLACK FRIDAY NON SURGICAL BBL OFFERS. Sign up to get the discounted offer” and “20% BLACK FRIDAY Discounts!” created undue emphasis on the limited time frame of the promotion. We considered that was likely to lead consumers to fear they would miss out on the offer if they did not book quickly. In that context, we considered that consumers could be rushed into making a decision to have cosmetic surgery without taking sufficient time to consider the consequences. Because the ad created a sense of undue urgency to book a cosmetic procedure quickly, we considered that it had not been prepared in a socially responsible manner and therefore breached the Code. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility). CAP Guidance on cosmetic interventions stated that marketers should not trivialise such procedures or suggest they could be undertaken lightly, because it was likely that all such interventions would carry some level of risk to the patient, such as infections. It was therefore important that marketers presented such procedures responsibly in their advertising. The ad referenced a number of cosmetic procedures, including liquid BBLs, alongside the claim “Discounts!”, which highlighted the savings consumers could make. It also included the claims “Achieve your body goals” and “Get instant results”, which presented the results of the procedure in a positive light. We considered that the ad’s focus on the potential price saving and the implied “instant” results, seen alongside the before and after images, created a trivial tone which detracted from the seriousness of the procedure. That impression was further underlined by the claims that consumers should act quickly so that they did not miss out. The ad also failed to highlight that there were risks involved in the procedure, which further added to the impression that deciding to have a procedure was not a serious decision. Because the ad detracted from the seriousness of the decision to undertake a cosmetic intervention, we concluded that it trivialised the risks of the surgery and was socially irresponsible. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Rejuvenate Academy Ltd t/a Rejuvenate Clinics to ensure that future ads did not pressure consumers into booking, or trivialise the risks of, cosmetic procedures.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/rejuvenate-academy-ltd-a25-1274788-rejuvenate-academy-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on The Innovative Brewing Company Ltd t/a Prime Time Lager,"Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaints that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ad and complaints under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code . Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A poster ad for Prime Time Lager, seen on the side of a bus in October 2024, included product images of cans of beer and a pint in a glass. Large text stated, “BEER, BUT BETTER.” Smaller text underneath included “63% FEWER CARBS”. Further text stated, “NEXT LEVEL TASTE, EASY ON THE WAIST”. The Prime Time logo appeared on the right, with text underneath which included “AND AT 4.2% ABV, WHY WOULDN’T YOU?”.",Two complainants challenged whether:,"1., 2., & 3. The Innovative Brewing Company Ltd t/a Prime Time Lager said that they believed the ad was compliant with the Code, as they had followed guidance from an external agency, which assured them the ad had been cleared by their legal team. Additionally, they stated that another team, adhering to rigorous rules and regulations, had also granted approval.","The CAP Code stated that the only nutrition claims permitted for alcohol were ""low-alcohol"", ""reduced alcohol”, “reduced energy"" or claims conveying an equivalent meaning to consumers. The Code defined a nutrition claim as any claim which stated, suggested or implied that a food (or drink) had particular beneficial nutritional properties due to the amount of calories, nutrients or other substances it contained, did not contain, or contained in reduced or increased proportions. The ASA considered the claim “63% FEWER CARBS” suggested that the product had particular beneficial nutritional properties because it was reduced in carbohydrates. It was therefore a nutrition claim for the purposes of the Code. However, it was not one of the three nutrition claims permitted to be made in relation to alcohol – and in addition was not permitted to be made in relation to any food or drink product. That claim therefore breached the Code. We noted the ad also included the claim “30% FEWER KCALS”, which was equivalent to a “reduced energy” nutrition claim, which was permitted for alcohol. We understood that the product met the necessary conditions of use for that claim, and it was therefore permitted under the Code. However, because it was not permitted to make the nutrition claim “63% FEWER CARBS”, we concluded that the ad breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 18.17 (Alcohol). The CAP Code stated that ads for alcoholic drinks must not make any health, fitness or weight-control claims. Health claims were defined as those that stated, suggested or implied that a relationship existed between a food or drink or one of its constituents and health. That included references to general benefits of a food or drink for overall good health or health-related well-being. We concluded that consumers were likely to interpret the claim “NEXT LEVEL TASTE, EASY ON THE WAIST” as implying that the product could contribute to weight loss or maintenance. We considered it was therefore a health claim. While the claim “BEER, BUT BETTER” could, in some contexts, suggest an enhancement in quality or taste, we considered that in the context of the ad it carried a different implication. The ad featured the claim “NEXT LEVEL TASTE, EASY ON THE WAIST”, the non-permitted nutrition claim “63% FEWER CARBS,” and the permitted nutrition claim “30% FEWER KCALS”, all of which emphasised nutrition and health benefits. In that context, the claim “BEER, BUT BETTER” was likely to be understood as implying that the beer provided general benefits to overall health and health-related well-being. It was therefore also a health claim for the purposes of the Code. Because health claims such as “NEXT LEVEL TASTE, EASY ON THE WAIST” and “BEER, BUT BETTER” were prohibited for alcoholic drinks, we concluded that the ad breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 18.17 (Alcohol). The CAP Code allowed that marketing communications may give factual information about the alcoholic strength of a drink. However, they must not imply that a drink may be preferred because of its alcohol content or intoxicating effect. While the Code allowed that low-alcohol drinks (containing between 0.5% and 1.2% alcohol) may be presented as preferable because of their low alcoholic strength, the advertised product was not low-alcohol. The ad stated “'AND AT 4.2% ABV, WHY WOULDN’T YOU?”. We considered that statement went beyond a factual presentation of information about the product’s ABV, because it emphasised the alcoholic strength of the product and suggested it may be preferred because of that. Additionally, we understood that the product’s ABV content was about average for a lager, but that some reduced calorie lagers had a lower-than-average ABV content. Therefore, in the context of the ad we considered the claim also suggested that Prime Time Lager may be preferred because it provided the nutritional benefits of a reduced calorie beer while maintaining the same alcoholic strength typically associated with regular lagers. We concluded that the claim implied the lager may be preferred because of its alcohol content. The ad, therefore, breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 18.9 (Alcohol).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told The Innovative Brewing Company Ltd t/a Prime Time Lager that future marketing communications must not make health claims or non-permitted nutrition claims about alcoholic drinks. They must not imply that a drink may be preferred because of its alcohol content.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/the-innovative-brewing-company-ltd-g24-1267427-the-innovative-brewing-company-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Belle Baby Ltd,"Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”).

The ad contained an image of a young girl wearing the swimsuit, popping her hip to one side and looking down at a bow on the side of the swimsuit.",The complainant challenged whether the ad portrayed a child in a sexual way.,Belle Baby Ltd said they had removed the image from their website.,"The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not portray or represent anyone who was, or seemed to be, under 18 years of age in a sexual way. The girl was aged around five or six years. She appeared to be wearing eye shadow, heavy mascara and lipstick and had her long hair styled in curls. She was standing in a pose in which her hip was popped to one side, her back was arched and her eyes were downcast to look at a bow sewn on to the hip of her swimsuit, which she was also holding with one hand. We considered the pose and styling would be typically associated with older models, rather than being the natural posture or pose of a child. Although the swimsuit she was wearing was appropriate and intended for a child of her age, and the ASA acknowledged that young children typically enjoyed dressing up and looking older, we nevertheless considered that the combination of her styled hair and heavy make-up, her downward and submissive-looking glance and the way her hip was popped to one side had the effect of portraying her in a sexual way. We therefore concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 4.8 (Harm and offence).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We welcomed Belle Baby Ltd’s decision to withdraw the ad.

The paid-for Facebook ad featured text stating, “Dear Friends, For over three decades I’ve poured my heart into every pair of leather shoes I’ve crafted. The time has now come to close my workshop – a bittersweet decision, but one that allows me to reflect on a lifetime of creativity, dedication and the incredible community we’ve built […]”. The ad featured an image of a fictitious newspaper with the headline “Henry’s final farewell” and images of a man making shoes in a workshop. The ad also featured a “Shop Now” button that linked to the website and text stating “UP TO 80% OFF Henry’s Boots”. b. The website, www.henry-boots.com, featured images of a man making shoes in a workshop.

We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. Ad (a) included the claims “Dear Friends, For over three decades I’ve poured my heart into every pair of leather shoes I’ve crafted”, “the time has come for me to close my workshop – a bittersweet decision, but one that allows me to reflect on a lifetime of creativity, dedication, and the incredible community we’ve built…”, and was accompanied by what appeared to be an extract from a local newspaper with the heading “Henry’s FINAL FAREWELL” alongside an image of a man in a workshop crafting shoes, which appeared to be AI-generated. The ASA considered that consumers were likely to understand from those claims and the image that the boots advertised were handmade by Henry in his workshop and that Henry’s Boots was closing down. Ad (b) also included repeated claims reiterating that the shoes were handmade by a highly experienced cobbler in his own workshop, who had taken great care and pride in his work, and that he was closing his workshop. It also featured images of a man making shoes in a workshop, which appeared to have been AI-generated. We considered that consumers were likely to understand from those claims and the accompanying images that the boots advertised were handmade by Henry in his workshop and that Henry’s Boots was closing down. We had not seen any evidence that the boots being advertised were handmade by “Henry” or that Henry’s Boots was closing down. In the absence of such evidence, we concluded that the claims had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). We considered that consumers would understand from the claim “Every pair of leather boots comes with a lifetime craftmanship guarantee. If you’re not completely satisfied, return them for a full refund – no questions asked” in ad (b) that they could return the product for any reason and at any time and they would receive a full refund. Because we had not seen any evidence that a lifetime guarantee existed, and that products could be returned for any reason and at any time for a full refund, we concluded that the claim had not been substantiated and was misleading. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead by omitting material information, hiding it, or presenting it in an untimely manner. For ads that quoted prices for advertised products, the geographical address of the marketer is included within material information. Ad (b), which quoted prices for the advertised products, stated on a page featuring the Terms and Conditions, “Company details: on request” but there was no information on the website regarding the geographical address from which they operated. We therefore concluded that ad (b) omitted material information about the advertiser’s geographical location and was therefore misleading.

ASA Ruling on Person(s) unknown t/a Rosely London,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ads from companies which give the impression they are based in the UK but are actually based overseas in countries such as China, identified for investigation following complaints received by the ASA.

We reminded them of their responsibility to provide this information to the ASA or CAP without delay if requested. The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “Embrace ultimate softness with our Rosely Loose Cashmere Jacket” in ad (a) to mean that the jacket was made of cashmere. While we understood that the product listing on the website, which was linked to from ad (a), explained that the jacket was made from a blend of polyester and spandex, which gave the feel of cashmere, that was not stated in ad (a). We therefore considered that did not counter the impression given by ad (a) that the jacket was made of cashmere. Because consumers were likely to understand the claim “ultimate softness with our Rosely Loose Cashmere Jacket” to mean the jacket was made of cashmere, when that was not the case, we concluded that the claim had not been substantiated and was misleading. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). The CAP Code stated that marketers must promptly refund consumers who made valid claims under an advertised money-back guarantee.

We had not seen evidence to show that Rosely London had refunded money to consumers under the money back guarantee. In the absence of that evidence, we concluded that the claims regarding the money-back guarantee in ad (b) had not been substantiated and were misleading. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.55 (Guarantees and after-sales service).

It included a banner at the top of each page stating “Velora London”, reference to “Free Shipping with Royal Mail” and UK deliveries, the contact email “ [email protected] ” and the text “Covent Garden, London” alongside a location pin. The ASA considered that consumers were likely to understand from those elements of ads (a) and (b) that Velora London was based in the UK and, specifically, London. Velora London did not confirm their geographical business address and we understood from the complainants that they were based in China. Because ads (a) and (b) gave the impression that the company was based in London, UK, when we understood that was not the case, we concluded that the ad was ads were misleading. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising). We considered consumers would understand the claim in ad (b), “we have an average delivery time of 5-10 working days for orders in the UK”, to mean they could expect their order to arrive in around that number of days. We had not seen evidence to show that Velora London adhered to those delivery times and we understood from the complainants that because Velora London’s products were shipped from China, delivery to the UK took longer than 5-10 working days. In the absence of such evidence, we considered that the claim in ad (b) “we have an average delivery time of 5-10 working days for orders in the UK” had not been substantiated and concluded it was misleading. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). The CAP Code stated that marketers must promptly refund consumers who made valid claims under an advertised money-back guarantee. We considered consumers would understand the claims in ad (b), “30-Day Money Back Guarantee”, “Stress-Free Returns Within 30 days” and “a ‘100% money-back guarantee’: 30 days after receiving the product you have the right to return it”, to mean they could return their items within 30 days if they were not satisfied with them for any reason and obtain a refund. We had not seen evidence to show that Velora London had refunded money to consumers under the money-back guarantee. In the absence of that evidence, we considered that the claims regarding the money-back guarantee in ad (b) had not been substantiated and concluded they were misleading. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.55 (Guarantees and after-sales service). We considered that customers would understand the claim in ad (b) that the “Hannah Woven Hoodie Jacket” was “in delicate Merino wool” and an “Impeccable knit from fine Merino wool” to mean the jacket was made from Merino wool. We had not seen evidence to show that the Hannah Woven Hoodie Jacket was made from Merino wool. In the absence of such evidence, we considered that the claim had not been substantiated and concluded that it was misleading. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead by omitting material information, hiding it, or presenting it in an untimely manner. For ads that quoted prices for advertised products, material information included the geographical address of the marketer. Ad (b) contained quoted prices for advertised products. While the ad did include an email address, it omitted the geographical address from which the company operated. We therefore concluded that because the ad, which quoted prices for advertised products, omitted material information about the advertiser’s geographical address, it breached the Code. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.3, and 3.4.2 (Misleading advertising).","Ads (a) and (b) must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Person(s) unknown t/a Velora London to ensure their advertising did not misleadingly state or imply they were based in the UK and, where their ads quoted prices for advertised products, to include the geographical address from which they operated.

ASA Ruling on Person(s) unknown t/a Luxelle-London,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ads from companies which give the impression they are based in the UK, but are actually based overseas in countries such as China, identified for investigation following complaints received by the ASA. Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complain that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ads and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code . Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Two paid-for Facebook ads and a website for Luxelle-London, an online clothing retailer: a. The first Facebook ad, seen in November 2024, was headed “Luxelle-London”. It stated, “After many years of love and dedication to our boutique, Luxelle, we must now surrender […] the big giants […] continue to push small entrepreneurs like us to the sidelines […] sadly, our boutique can no longer keep up”. The ad included a photo of a woman working on a sewing machine and the text “CLOSING SALE”. b. The second Facebook ad, seen in November 2024, also headed “Luxelle-London”, included the same opening text as ad (a). It was signed off “with love, Margaret and Edith” and referred to them wanting to spend time with their grandchildren. c. The website www.luxelle-london.com, seen in November 2024, headed “LUXELLE LONDON”, stated “OUR STORY […] With heavy hearts, we're saying goodbye to our cherished online store […]”. Another web page, with the “RETURN AND REFUND POLICY” stated “[…] Before returning any item, please contact us by email to obtain the correct return address. This address cannot be obtained elsewhere, so it’s essential to reach out for accurate information […]”. The “TERMS AND CONDITIONS” web page gave the “Customer Service Email: [email protected] ” and a “Chamber of Commerce Number: 87017857”.",,Person(s) unknown t/a Luxelle-London did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Luxelle-London's lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code as well as their failure to provide their full name and geographical business address, which were in breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.7 (Unreasonable delay) and 1.7.1 (Compliance). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries without delay and told them to do so in the future. Ads (a) and (b) were headed “Luxelle-London”. Ad (c) was the website, which had the domain name www.luxelle-london.com and was also headed “LUXELLE LONDON”. Ad (c) included the email address [email protected] and cited a Chamber of Commerce number for the company. The ASA considered that consumers were likely to understand from the repeated references to London in the headings, domain name and email address, the website's co.uk domain and the Chamber of Commerce number that the advertiser was based in the UK and, specifically, London. Luxelle-London did not confirm their geographical business address and we understood from the complainant that they were based in China. Because ads (a), (b) and (c) gave the impression that the company was based in London, UK, when we understood that was not the case, we concluded that the ads were misleading. On that point, ads (a), (b) and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, and 3.3 (Misleading advertising). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead by omitting material information, hiding it, or presenting it in an untimely manner. For ads that quoted prices for advertised products, geographical address of the marketer is included within material information. Ad (c) quoted prices for advertised products. The ad included an email address but not a geographical address from which the company operated. The refund policy stated that consumers were required to contact the company by email to obtain a return address for them. We therefore concluded that because the ad, which quoted prices for advertised products, omitted material information about the advertiser’s geographical address, it breached the Code. On that point, ad (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.3, and 3.4.2 (Misleading advertising).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

The bottom of the home page featured a photo of a London street with a London bus, Union Jack flags and red telephone boxes. The Refund Policy page explained, “As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction, we accept returns to our UK warehouse. For more information on how to initiate a return, please contact our customer service team at [email protected] ”. On the Refund Policy Page, under the heading, “How to Return Your Order” customers were again instructed to email [email protected] , but the “Shipping in Transit” section of the same web page referred to the “shipping process from Asia”. A third web page explained how to “GET IN TOUCH”. It was again headed “MUSE LONDON” and gave the “ [email protected] ” email address.",,Muse did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Muse’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code as well as their failure to provide their full name and geographical business address, which were in breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.7 (Unreasonable delay) and 1.7.1 (Compliance). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries without delay and told them to do so in the future. The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead by omitting material information, hiding it or presenting it in an untimely manner. For ads that quoted prices for advertised products, material information included the geographical address of the marketer. The ad had multiple references to “MUSE LONDON” alongside photos of a London street, with a London bus, Union Jack flags and a red telephone box. The website’s URL had a co.uk domain as did the company’s email address that was provided on the website. The ad also referred to the company having a warehouse in the UK, where returns could be sent. The ASA considered that consumers were likely to understand from those elements that the advertiser was based in the UK. Whilst the ad did refer to there being a “shipping process from Asia” on the Refund Policy page, we considered that text was not prominent and did not sufficiently counter the impression, given by the other elements described above, that the company was based in the UK. Furthermore, the website quoted prices for advertised products and, save for the single reference to a “shipping process from Asia”, there was no information on the website regarding the geographical address from which the advertiser operated. We therefore concluded that the ad omitted material information about the advertiser’s geographical location and misleadingly implied that the advertiser was based in the UK, when that was not the case.

ASA Ruling on TotalEnergies SE,"Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”).

A video embedded in the post detailed TotalEnergies’ work with the company NASH Renewables and included images of wind turbines and people working in an office. A voice-over, from NASH Renewables’ co-founder, stated, “[There are] more options to design one particular wind farm than […] atoms in the universe. So, with NASH, it's trying to figure out through algorithms what the optimal way to build a wind or solar farm is […] Getting the stamp of TotalEnergies for this new way of thinking, of course, brought our company massively forward.” On-screen text then stated, “THE ROADS TO CARBON NEUTRAL […] A SPECIAL PRESENTATION BY”, followed by the TotalEnergies logo and the text “Pioneers for 100 years”.",Adfree Cities challenged whether the ad was misleading because it omitted material information about the overall environmental impact of TotalEnergies’ business activities.,"TotalEnergies SE said the ad was part of an episode of their series The Roads to Carbon Neutral, which aimed to highlight case studies that demonstrated TotalEnergies’ profile as a multi-energy company, committed to transitioning towards increasingly decarbonized sources of energy. The ad focused on NASH Renewables and their participation in TotalEnergies’ business start-up accelerator programme, the ON programme, through which they, and other businesses involved in renewable energies and electricity, received investment and support. They said that NASH Renewables joined the programme in December 2022 and TotalEnergies acquired the company in December 2023. TotalEnergies explained that the ad ran as a paid-for ad on both X and another social media platform for a two-week period, and was targeted towards users interested in energy, technology and innovation, ‘business opinion leaders’, people capable of influencing the actions or opinions of a number of individuals by virtue of their reputation, media visibility or expertise, and investors. The ad was targeted towards those interested in energy, technology and innovation via a keyword method, which served the ad to users actively using at least one predefined keyword in either their searches, their recent posts or posts they had interacted with. They said the targeting of the ad towards business opinion leaders and investors was based upon an interest-based method. That involved selecting various predefined interest groups offered by X, which were reflective of a user’s active behaviour on the platform, to focus the ad towards the desired audience. They said the ad, in its paid-for form, was not seen by general users of X. The vast majority of users who encountered the ad would have been particularly well-informed and knowledgeable in relation to the general nature of an energy company’s business model, and would have an appreciation that the practices shown in the NASH Renewables case study were just one of a number of steps being taken in order to reduce TotalEnergies’ carbon emissions. They said the name of the series The Roads to Carbon Neutral, reflected the variety of solutions that could be taken to achieve carbon neutrality, and that process was ongoing. The video and a URL below it linked to a webpage that made clear the aim of the series was to present various initiatives that could contribute, without suggesting any single one was sufficient, to achieving carbon neutrality in the future. They said the ad’s video focused on the work of NASH Renewables and how TotalEnergies’ ON programme supported it, and did not make a claim, or an implicit suggestion, about TotalEnergies’ environmental credentials. On the webpage the ad linked through to, the full episode was available, and the wording used on the page was aspirational, balanced and explained how NASH Renewables was contributing towards TotalEnergies’ net zero ambitions without exaggerating their contribution. TotalEnergies said that due to the constraints of the medium used for the ad, further information about TotalEnergies’ business practices could not be given within it. As a result, their website made clear they were involved in oil and gas, and renewable energies, and from there information could be found about their current and planned production and sales energy mixes, as well as their broader greenhouse gas reduction targets. TotalEnergies said the ad did not include any broad or ambiguous ‘green’ claims. The claim “The Roads to Carbon Neutral” would be understood in relation to their own business practices, which included the production of oil and biofuels, natural gas and green gases, renewables and electricity. They wanted to be a major player in the energy transition and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. By 2030 they aimed to have reduced their sales of petroleum products by 40% (compared to 2019 sales), and they aimed for petroleum products to make up 30% of their sales by 2030 (compared to the 65% share they comprised in 2015). They were set to meet these objectives, as 43% of their 2023 sales comprised petroleum products (compared to 65% in 2015) and 10% of low carbon energies (compared to 2% in 2015). In 2023, 31.7% of their annual capital expenditure was directed towards low carbon activities, with $4 billion allocated to developing electricity generation from wind capacity up to 2030. Alongside that, they had also invested $100 million annually into carbon sinks, such as forestry, regenerative farming and wetlands protection, which would have a cumulated lifespan cost of $725 million, and were investing in geological carbon storage. From that, they said the intention of the claim was to communicate that TotalEnergies were in the early stages of their journey towards carbon neutrality. TotalEnergies said they were on a legitimate and credible pathway towards net zero carbon emissions, and that they considered it important they communicate the steps they were taking, while being mindful of their obligation to tell a balanced story that did not omit information or present it in a misleading manner.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead by omitting material information. It also stated unqualified environmental claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. TotalEnergies (formerly known as Total until 2021) had placed targeting parameters on the ad to direct it towards an audience that comprised those interested in energy technology and innovation, business opinion leaders and investors. However, we considered the methods used, keyword and interest-based targeting, meant that the ad was seen by a general consumer and business audience, rather than a business-only audience. In addition, the targeting parameters were broad and, within the audience as a whole, there was unlikely to be a consistent level of knowledge between the respective members of each group. The ad was only seen by members of the targeted groups. However, we considered they still comprised a general audience as the targeting parameters did not ensure delivery to those with a substantially different level of knowledge and understanding to that of a general consumer and business audience in a wider context. The ad, its video and caption, linked NASH Renewables, and their work to help optimise the design of wind and solar energy farms, with TotalEnergies via their ON business start-up accelerator programme. The caption stated, “Uncover how TotalEnergies’ electricity start-up accelerator program has supported start-ups like Nash Renewables”. The video featured imagery of wind turbines and referred to NASH’s work and how TotalEnergies had supported them. The ad concluded with the claim “THE ROADS TO CARBON NEUTRAL […] A SPECIAL PRESENTATION BY” and displayed the TotalEnergies logo. We considered the likely overall impression of the ad, relating to both the claims and imagery in the caption and the video, was that a significant proportion of TotalEnergies’ business activities, which included the ownership of NASH Renewables, was focused on the development and expansion of renewable energies, including through supporting other companies in doing so, and that was directly driving TotalEnergies towards being carbon neutral. We understood that videos automatically played on X. However, that setting could be changed, and videos may not automatically play for all users. Nonetheless, the ad’s caption alone created the impression that TotalEnergies’ business activities were predominately focused on the development of renewable energies and companies associated with its development, such as NASH Renewables. The name of the series, ‘The Roads to Carbon Neutral’, which featured at the end of the video, would not be understood as indicating the significance of TotalEnergies’ green activities, including the ON programme, in proportion to their wider business practices. We acknowledged that TotalEnergies website, which was accessed by clicking the video once it was playing or the URL beneath it, contained further information about their ON start-up accelerator programme and TotalEnergies’ wider business activities. However, we considered the ad was not limited by time or space to the extent that information which contextualised the significance of their green activities and progress could not have been included. The caption had used 117 characters of a possible 280, and the video was 30 seconds in length. Additionally, that website was different to the one referred to in the video, www.roadstocarbonneutral.com. While the latter website suggested TotalEnergies was attempting to lower its environmental impact, it did not make clear the significance of their progress towards carbon neutrality in relation to their wider business activities. The ad’s audience was likely to have an awareness that many companies in carbon-intensive industries, including the oil and gas sector, aimed to dramatically reduce their emissions in response to the climate crisis. We considered that consumers were increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon products and services. They would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, that were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services. Business audiences would be interested in suppliers and investors who were transitioning towards lower-carbon products and services. However, both general consumers and business audiences were unlikely to be aware of the details of that in relation to specific companies. Ads for companies in higher carbon sectors that focused on their green initiatives were therefore likely to mislead consumers if they did not include details of the contribution that lower-carbon initiatives played as part of the overall balance of a company's current or near future activities. TotalEnergies had set itself objectives to reduce the absolute amount of petroleum products it sold, and the proportion of those products in their total sales. We acknowledged they were investing in carbon sinks and geological carbon storage, and renewable and low carbon energies. They also expected to reduce their fossil fuel output by 2030. However, we understood that a significant proportion of the energy products TotalEnergies produced and sold were fossil-fuel related products. As per TotalEnergies’ Sustainability and Climate 2024 report, in 2023, 90% of their sales arose from petroleum and gas products. Additionally, in 2030, they were targeting for 30% of their sales to comprise oil, 50% gas, and 20% low-carbon molecules and electricity. The report also stated that their total Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from sites and assets they either operated, or in which they held an equity stake, were 84 million tonnes CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent). In 2023 TotalEnergies were responsible for 1.5% of global oil production and had allocated 68.3% of their capital expenditure towards fossil fuel energies and 31.7% to lower-carbon activities. The ad focused on lower-carbon energy products. Although TotalEnergies were taking steps to diversify their energy production, as consumers and business audiences were likely to view the ad as reflective of their current activity, information about the proportion of TotalEnergies’ overall business model that comprised lower-carbon energy products was material information that should have been included. In the absence of that information, we concluded the ad was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 11.1 (Environmental claims).","The ad, the video and caption, must not appear again in the form complained of. We told TotalEnergies SE to ensure their future ads that focused on environmental initiatives did not mislead by omitting material information about the proportion of their overall business activities that comprised lower-carbon activities.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/totalenergies-se-a24-1246357-totalenergies-se.html
ASA Ruling on Viagogo GmbH,"Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”).

Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, one of which was Upheld. The other was resolved informally with the advertiser’s agreement to make changes.","A podcast ad for Viagogo, heard on 22 April 2024, during an episode of the Political Currency podcast. The hosts stated, “This episode is sponsored by Viagogo, the world’s leading marketplace that helps fans safely buy and sell tickets to their favourite live events […] Viagogo say they provide a regulated, safe and secure marketplace with a range of robust, industry leading safeguards in place to protect consumers. Did you know that over half the events listed on Viagogo had tickets selling below face value? […] It sounds like Viagogo might be the solution next time I need cheaper tickets to the hottest shows in town […] If you were to buy tickets for an event on Viagogo, their guarantee means that in the very rare instance that an issue arises, full refunds will be issued or replacement tickets of comparable value at no extra charge […] Viagogo provide flexibility and choice when buying tickets allowing you to safely get in the room at your favourite live events, whether you miss the original on-sale date or simply don’t have the time to queue for hours online.”",FanFair Alliance challenged whether the claim “over half the events listed on Viagogo had tickets selling below face value” was misleading and could be substantiated.,"Viagogo GmbH t/a Viagogo said that the claim “over half the events listed on Viagogo had tickets selling below face value” was based on data covering the whole of 2023, which they considered appropriate substantiation for a claim made in April 2024. “Face value” was calculated by inputting the base price of a ticket, excluding booking fees, service charges, delivery fees or any other charges, and then applying a 20% increase. They said that 20% of the base ticket price was the average additional cost paid by consumers for those additional fees and charges when buying tickets from their original seller, based on an independent study. They said the claim compared the Viagogo price, including all fees and charges, against the face value price including the 20% for fees and charges, which they believed was an appropriate like-for-like comparison. On that basis, in 2023, of all UK events for which tickets were sold on Viagogo’s marketplace, 53% had at least one ticket sold at below face value.","The ad included the claim “over half the events listed on Viagogo had tickets selling below face value”. The ASA considered that consumers would understand the phrase face value to be referring to the price listed on the ticket (the ticket price) when purchased from the original seller, excluding any booking fees or other charges. In that context, we considered that consumers would understand the claim to mean that they would have a reasonable chance to purchase those tickets through Viagogo, below the ticket price. We also noted that the claim referred to “tickets” which we considered implied that more than one ticket was sold below face value per event. The ad also stated that “It sounds like Viagogo might be the solution next time I need cheaper tickets to the hottest shows in town” which we considered reinforced the impression that consumers would likely be able to purchase tickets below the ticket price. We assessed the evidence provided by Viagogo. We first considered Viagogo’s definition of face value as used to substantiate the claim in the ad, which was calculated by adding a 20% increase to the ticket price to account for booking fees, service charges, delivery fees or any other charges the original ticket purchaser may have paid. We also understood that, in addition to that 20% increase, Viagogo added a delivery fee to the purchase, once the consumer had selected their preferred delivery method. We considered that definition did not reflect consumer’s understanding of the face value of a ticket, because it included the various booking fees and other charges paid by consumers. We also understood that it did not reflect Viagogo’s own use of the term face value on their website, where it related to the ticket price. Because of the disparity between the ticket price and Viagogo’s definition of face value, we considered that the data provided was not relevant in supporting the claim as it would be understood by consumers. Notwithstanding the above, under Viagogo’s definition, 53% of events listed on the website had sold at least one ticket below face value. We considered, however, that one ticket per event was not a significant proportion of tickets and, as such, did not represent a reasonable chance for consumers to purchase tickets below face value. We further considered that, because consumers would expect more than one ticket to be sold below face value per event, that implied claim also was not substantiated by the information provided. For the above reasons, we considered that the claim, as it would be understood by consumers, had not been substantiated and was therefore misleading. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Viagogo GmbH t/a Viagogo to ensure that they did not mislead consumers by claiming that over half the events listed on Viagogo had tickets selling below face value, if that was not the case.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/viagogo-gmbh-a24-1242838-viagogo-gmbh.html
ASA Ruling on OceanSaver Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Four issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld","A website and a TV ad for cleaning product manufacturer OceanSaver, seen on 25 April 2024: a. The website www.ocean-saver.com, included the claims: “Biodegradable Film. Each pod is made of PVOH film, and even though technically plastic…it’s one of the good plastics that are dissolvable and fully biodegrade!”; “Plastic-free”; “100% plastic-free and contain zero microplastics”; “Zero Plastics. Zero Microplastics”; and “Every product bought makes an impact, with over 2 million pieces of plastic […] saved from our ocean so far”. The ad also featured listings with pack shots of OceanSaver’s “Eco Laundry Capsules” and “Eco Dishwasher Tablets”, both of which included the claim “Plastic free”. b. The TV ad featured a person using a washing machine while computer-generated crabs sang a song that included the lyrics “You switched all your cleaning to be plastic-free, without harmful chemicals, so you don’t harm the sea […] OCEAN SAVER, the ocean will thank you”. The same pack shots as ad (a) were shown alongside on-screen text that stated, “OCEAN SAVER. THE OCEAN WILL THANK YOU”.","Ecover (UK) Ltd and People Against Dirty Holdings Ltd, who understood OceanSaver’s “Eco Laundry Capsules” and “Eco Dishwasher Tablets” used a dissolvable film that contained polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), challenged whether the following claims were misleading and could be substantiated:","1. & 2. OceanSaver Ltd said the word “plastic” was used by many brands as a synonym for “polymer”, despite the difference between the two. They explained that PVOH, uniquely, could change shape and break down into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water when consumed by organisms common in water treatment facilities and that had been found in the environment. They said PVOH was exempt from European microplastics restrictions set out in Commission Regulation (EU) 2023/2055 (the 2023 Regulation), owing to its water solubility and because it did not produce solid microparticles. Since PVOH did not produce microplastics, it did not create plastic waste. They provided a piece of legislation from the US State of Maine, a peer-reviewed journal article, two webpages, ingredients for their products, and two manufacturer statements. On the claim “so you don’t harm the sea” in ad (b), OceanSaver said that pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 which related to the labelling of chemicals, substances assessed under that regime as being harmful to aquatic life with long lasting effects had to carry a hazard statement. Specifically hazard statement H412 which stated, “Harmful to aquatic life with long lasting effects”. Classification as such was based on a substance’s chronic toxicity. They explained that even if a substance was biodegradable, it could still be classified as long-term hazardous to the aquatic environment. They said OceanSaver’s laundry capsules did not carry the harmful to aquatic life designation and did not carry the statement. Clearcast said, in relation to ad (b), that PVOH was a water-soluble synthetic polymer made from the monomer vinyl alcohol, rather than a plastic, and that it biodegraded into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. Because of that, in their view it was not a traditional plastic that would remain in the ecosystem for a long time with detrimental consequences to the environment, which is how most consumers would understand the term “plastic”. 3. OceanSaver said they would remove the term “fully” from future “biodegradable” claims. They explained there was no scientific literature on the biodegradability of PVOH specifically naming any particular brand. They provided four peer-reviewed journal articles, a magazine article, a book chapter, a blog post, a fact sheet from a US cleaning product producer trade body, two statements from a US chemical manufacturer, and a biodegradability report from the manufacturing factory for the products. 4. OceanSaver said 80% of plastic in the ocean originated on land and provided a web page from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in support. They explained that they had sold more than two million units of their products, and that each individual sale would result in one less equivalent non-biodegradable product being purchased from a competitor brand, therefore saving one plastic bottle for each unit sold. Furthermore, they had sold in excess of 407,000 capsules, resulting in consumers purchasing 11,000 litres less from competitor brands. They had sold 775,634 units in the 12 months leading to ad (b) airing, which they said equated to 4,178,212 pieces of plastic saved by not buying plastic competitor products. They said that if even 50% of plastic in the ocean originated on land instead of 80%, they were in excess of the claimed amount of plastic saved from entering the sea.","The ASA considered consumers would understand the claims “plastic-free” and “zero microplastics” as meaning the products about which the claims were made, and their packaging, did not contain plastic and would not degrade into microplastics. We further considered the claim “so you don’t harm the sea” in ad (b), as meaning the claimed “plastic-free” nature of the advertised products meant they were not harmful to marine life. To support the claims we expected to see evidence that showed the advertised product did not contain plastic, would not degrade into microplastics and would not harm marine life. We assessed the evidence provided by OceanSaver. The state legislation did not pertain to PVOH-containing laundry or dishwasher tablets; the London Recycles article listed only plastics that could be recycled in London and did not comment on the composition of PVOH; and the Centre for Science in the Public Interest web page made only general statements about the use of plastics in food packaging rather than in laundry or dishwasher products. We therefore considered they were not sufficiently robust substantiation to support claims for a detergent generally available in the UK. The journal article discussed the use of biodegradable films in liquid detergent capsules and had considered six studies on the biodegradation of PVOH. It concluded that PVOH used in liquid detergent films did not meet any of the definitions of a microplastic. However, we understood the studies reviewed did not relate to OceanSaver’s product specifically. The ingredients lists for the advertised products listed their contents only, and not the composition of the film. We therefore considered the findings of the article could not be cross applied to the advertised products and were consequently not adequate substantiation for the claims. One statement from a manufacturer of the PVOH film stated the product complied with the 2023 Regulation. While the 2023 Regulation was silent on whether PVOH was designated as a microplastic, we considered its omission from the Regulation did not, per se, mean it was not a plastic or source of microplastics. Nor did the omission demonstrate that it would cause no harm to the sea or aquatic life. Ad (b) stated “so you don’t harm the sea” and implied that because they had the claimed property of being “plastic-free”, by using OceanSaver’s products consumers would not be contributing to marine pollution or harming marine life. We acknowledged OceanSaver’s comments that the packaging for the advertised laundry pods did not carry the H412 hazard warning statement, which meant their content was not harmful to aquatic life with long lasting effects. However, we understood that warning pertained only to the chemical content of the pods, rather than their PVOH membrane. We therefore considered the absence of an H412 hazard warning statement on the advertised product was not in itself adequate substantiation for the implied claim that the product in its entirety would not harm sea or aquatic life. For those reasons we concluded the claim “zero microplastics” in ad (a) and “plastic-free” in both ads, and “so you don’t harm the sea” in ad (b), had not been substantiated. On point 1, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 11.1 (Environmental claims). On point 2, ad (b) breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation), and 9.2 (Environmental claims). We considered consumers would understand the claims “Biodegradable film” and “fully biodegrade” in ad (a), which appeared alongside an image of a laundry pod, to mean OceanSaver’s laundry pods, and the film in which they were coated, would fully biodegrade through normal use in a washing machine. We assessed the evidence provided by OceanSaver. Two of the journal articles, the book chapter, and the blog post discussed PVOH but did not relate to either its application in laundry, OceanSaver’s products or products with a similar composition. The fact sheet, the remaining journal articles, the two statements and the magazine article referred to the use of PVOH in laundry pods. However, they did not relate to OceanSaver’s laundry pods nor a product with the same composition and did not show that they were fully biodegradable through normal use in a washing machine. Additionally, one of the articles reviewed studies that showed different levels of degradation of between 38% and 86%, which meant that some PVOH was left. The biodegradability report from the manufacturing factory and a statement from a manufacturer of the PVOH film showed between them the results of three different testing methods – ASTM D6691, which tested the rate of aerobic biodegradation of plastic materials in seawater; UNI EN ISO 14852, which determined the ultimate aerobic biodegradability of plastic materials in an aqueous medium; and OECD 301-F, which determined the complete biodegradability of organic substances in water. However, they did not show the laundry pods were fully biodegradable through normal use. For those reasons we concluded the claims “Biodegradable film” and “fully biodegrade” in ad (a) had not been adequately substantiated and were likely to mislead. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 (Environmental claims). We considered consumers would understand from the claim “over 2 million pieces of plastic and 11,000 litres of harmful chemicals saved from our Ocean so far” in ad (a) that by buying OceanSaver’s products consumers were in some way contributing to that effort. The web page was a fact sheet from the WWF that stated 80% of plastic in the ocean originated on land. While OceanSaver had provided information about its unit sales, we had not seen evidence that showed they had prevented the claimed plastic and chemicals from entering the sea, nor that by buying OceanSaver’s products consumers would contribute to that level of prevention. We therefore concluded the claim had not been substantiated. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).","Ads (a) and (b) must not appear or be broadcast again in the form complained of. We told OceanSaver Ltd to ensure they held suitably robust substantiation for environmental claims, related to the full life cycle of a product where relevant.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/oceansaver-ltd-g24-1266714-oceansaver-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Rosenthal Capital Ltd t/a ULEZPROSPERITY,,"Two radio ads for ULEZProsperity heard on LBC in October 2024: (a) The first ad said, “City driving can give you financial returns with ULEZProsperity. Imagine owning a car that earns like a house. You buy it, we rent it back, and you reap the rewards. Become a car lord today and drive returns for 37 months, with a guaranteed sale price at the end. Interested? To start your journey and for terms and conditions, visit ulezprosperity.com. Ulezprosperity.com. Drive prosperity forward”. (b) The second ad said, “Own a car that earns a return! You buy it, we rent it back, and you reap the rewards. Get info and conditions at ulezprosperity.com”.","The complainant challenged whether the ads breached the Code because they implied that buying a car, which was an unregulated product, had investment potential and therefore they should not have been broadcast on a non-specialist radio station.","Rosenthal Capital Ltd t/a ULEZProsperity said their product was a commercial arrangement rather than a financial or regulated investment product and that the ads did not present the arrangement as an investment. They said the ads described fixed, predictable financial returns derived from a rental agreement and a guaranteed buyback price. They explained that the customer rented a vehicle to ULEZProsperity for a fixed monthly return under a defined contract term of 37 months. Their product differed from an investment product because customers retained full legal ownership, which was evidenced by the vehicle’s registration document, invoices and contracts that were issued in the customer’s name. They also said that the arrangement mirrored other commercial agreements where assets, such as property or vehicles, were leased or rented to generate income for the owner. ULEZProsperity allowed car owners to derive a fixed rental income, and they ensured their ads were clear, factual and compliant with the BCAP Code. The ads featured the phrases: “financial returns”, which referred to the fixed rental income, not speculative gains; “drive returns for 37 months”, which described the structured rental period with defined payments, not an uncertain financial venture; and “reap the rewards”, which emphasised the benefits of participation in the programme and was consistent with marketing language for rental arrangements. The product was not speculative or an investment regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). In addition, the terms of ownership and the commercial nature of the arrangement were clear in the ads, and the benefits were not exaggerated. They explained that the ads invited listeners to visit the ULEZProsperity website for full terms and conditions or to speak directly to a consultant to get full insight into the programme. The website also included explanatory text that clarified the structured nature of returns, ensuring transparency and accessibility of material information, which they believed satisfied the requirement for qualifications to be presented clearly or made available. Radiocentre said they endorsed the advertiser’s points and, at the time of clearance, did not regard the ads as implying to listeners that it was an investment, but rather a financial benefit from rental.","The BCAP Code stated that certain categories of advertisements may be broadcast on specialised financial channels, stations or programming only, such as those for investments not regulated or permitted under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA). An advertisement that implied, for example, that a collectors’ item or other unregulated product or service could have investment potential (in the colloquial sense) would normally be unacceptable. The ASA acknowledged ULEZProsperity’s comment that the product was a commercial arrangement rather than a financial or regulated investment product. However, we considered the focus of the ads was on promoting a buy-to-let arrangement for cars which we considered was likely to be understood by consumers as a type of investment. Ad (a) referred to “financial returns”, “reap the rewards” and “drive returns for 37 months”, and ad (b) referred to “Own a car that earns a return”. We further noted that the car purchased would exclusively be let out and generally then sold at the end of the agreement and therefore was only purchased to generate returns for the user. We considered the claims in the ads and the way the product was presented gave the impression that it was an investment opportunity which would provide financial returns. We also acknowledged ULEZProsperity’s further comment that the ads invited listeners to visit the ULEZProsperity website for full terms and conditions. The website included text that stated, “EXAMPLE RETURNS WITH CAPITAL DEPLOYED” and return claims that stated a range of yields from 22.12% to 23.72% based on assets ranging from £20,000 to £30,000. The website also included small text at the bottom of the page that said, “Participating in our program carries inherent risks… While capital is 100% guaranteed, returns are projected. Past performance does not guarantee future results”. We understood from the website that ULEZProsperity offered an investment service, as suggested in ads (a) and (b). We considered that the ads implied that a buy-to-let arrangement for cars, which we understood was not regulated under FSMA, had investment potential. The ads should therefore have been broadcast only on a specialised financial radio channel and because that was not the case, we concluded that the ads breached the Code. Ads (a) and (b) breached BCAP Code rules 14.5 and 14.5.4 (Financial products, services and investments).","The ads must not be broadcast again in the form complained of on non-specialist stations. We told Rosenthal Capital Ltd t/a ULEZProsperity to ensure that future ads which implied that buying and letting cars, which was an unregulated financial product, had investment potential were broadcast only on specialised financial stations.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/rosenthal-capital-ltd-a24-1263931-rosenthal-capital-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on A3 Games Pte Ltd t/a Top Girl,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for the game Top Girl, seen on 20 December 2024, featured a video of a young female character. The character was shown on the street in the rain wearing wet clothes. A speech bubble stated, “Boss, I forgot my umbrella. Can you give me a ride home?"" Two options appeared: “FOR SURE” and “NO WAY”. The first option was selected. The character was then shown sitting in the back seat of a car with her knees drawn up. A speech bubble stated, “Boss, wearing wet clothes is really uncomfortable. Can I change clothes in your car?” From the two options, “FOR SURE” was selected, and heart emojis appeared around the character’s face. From the driver’s viewpoint, a button with the option “PEEK” appeared. The character was then shown wearing a different dress. A speech bubble stated, “Thank you, Boss. Do you want to come to my house for a drink?” From the two options, “FOR SURE” was selected. The character was then shown sitting on a kitchen worktop holding a drink and wearing a different dress. A speech bubble stated, “Boss, it’s quite late now. Do you want to stay the night?"" From the two options, “STAY” or “LEAVE”, the cursor hovered over “STAY” but eventually selected “LEAVE”. The character appeared shocked and unhappy. Text stated “YOU FAILED” with a “TRY AGAIN” button beneath. Various “Play Now” still images were shown in rotation, including one that stated “Boss, the next part is for 18 and over”.","The complainant, who believed that the ad was sexualised and objectified women, challenged whether the ad was harmful, offensive and irresponsible.",A3 Games Pte Ltd (A3 Games) did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by A3 Games’ lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The opening scene of the ad featured a female character in profile in a pose that emphasised her breasts and buttocks. She was wearing wet clothes through which her underwear could be seen. Although the ad did not feature nudity, we considered the styling and poses shown throughout were likely to be seen as sexually suggestive. Although we acknowledged that the female character appeared to be a willing participant in the seduction scenario and played an active role, we considered that the main focus of the ad was on the sexualised depiction of her body. We considered that portraying her in that way objectified her by presenting her as a sexual object for the purpose of titillating viewers. That impression was reinforced by the player- choice buttons, which included an invitation to “PEEK” at the character while she was changing her clothes. Because we considered the ad was sexualised and objectified women, we further considered it was likely to cause serious and widespread offence and included a gender stereotype in a way that was likely to cause harm. We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told A3 Games Pte Ltd t/a Top Girl to ensure that their ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious or widespread offence, including by featuring a harmful gender stereotype by objectifying and sexualising women.

ASA Ruling on Stars Interactive Ltd t/a PokerStars,,"An Instagram post from the PokerStars account, seen on 23 December 2024 featured a video of two people, Rory and McKola, in a casino. One was wearing a PokerStars branded jumper. Rory said, “Can you believe that? I invested £100 and five minutes later, [bleep]”. The video then flashed back to provide context, with McKola greeting viewers. “Yes people, what’s going on? McKola and Rory here, and PokerStars Casino have set us a little challenge. We’ve got a £100 each Ror, 10 spins, who’s gonna win?” The video showed them competing on separate slot machines, playing ""The Big Bass Bonanza"". McKola exclaimed, ""Mate, I’ve just won £185 on one spin"". Rory responded, ""No ... you serious?"" McKola continued, ""Another £100"", as the credit display updated to £320. As McKola won another £100, Rory asked, ""Are you just pressing the button? Are you doing anything? Give me some tips here"", to which McKola replied, ""You gotta heat your finger up."" Rory blew on his finger, pushed the button and won more money. McKola ended up with £662.50, while Rory finished with £240. McKola declared, ""Yeah, I’m just a lucky guy"" and Rory added, ""He beat me at everything. He beat me at the Last Longer, and now he’s beating me at slots.” The video concluded with Rory facing the camera as he did in the clip at the beginning of the ad, saying, “Can you believe that? I invested £100 and five minutes later, £240 because of my skill at slots”. Text in the caption stated “@chelsearory can’t catch a break! #PokerStars #Poker #PokerTournament #PokerLife #PokerPlayer. Play Responsibly. +18. BeGambleAware.org”.","The complainant challenged whether the ad portrayed, condoned or encouraged gambling behaviour that was socially irresponsible or could lead to financial harm.","Stars Interactive Ltd t/a PokerStars acknowledged that the ad did not comply with the CAP Code. They said that the ad was published in error and removed it from Instagram upon receiving the complaint. They said that they provided mandatory advertising compliance training to all employees involved in UK ad campaigns and were committed to ensuring that all forms of advertising followed the relevant legislation, regulations and any applicable industry codes of practice.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications for gambling must not portray, condone or encourage gambling behaviour that was socially irresponsible or could lead to financial, social or emotional harm. CAP and BCAP’s Advertising Guidance on ‘Gambling Advertising: responsibility and problem gambling’ also stated that marketers should take care to avoid trivialising gambling and avoid the impression that the decision to gamble should be taken lightly, for example they should not encourage frequent or repetitive participation. The ASA considered that the portrayal of McKola consistently winning large sums of money in a short period of time created a false sense of guaranteed success. Rory, the ""loser"" of the challenge, was also still shown making money, which reinforced that impression. Additionally, Rory claimed that playing slots was an investment, as he stated, ""I invested £100 and five minutes later, £240 because of my skill at slots."" His action of blowing on his finger and pushing the button to win more money gave the impression that luck or simple actions could lead to significant rewards. We considered that the claim that playing slots was an investment, together with the portrayal of easy and repetitive wins, gave the impression that the decision to gamble had been taken lightly and was therefore likely to encourage some consumers to participate repetitively. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad portrayed, condoned and encouraged gambling behaviour that was socially irresponsible and could lead to harm, and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1, 16.3 and 16.3.1 (Gambling).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Bestway Retail Ltd t/a Bargain Booze,,"A paid-for Facebook and Instagram ad for Bargain Booze, seen on 3 December 2024: a. The Facebook ad included a caption that began “It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas…”. The accompanying video featured festive music, and Santa arriving at a Bargain Booze shop in a red car. He entered the shop, prompting a woman to look around the end of an aisle and hold her hand up to her mouth in shock and excitement. Santa looked at the different alcohol available. He watched the customers and used an app on a tablet to match different alcohol products to different people and decide whether the customers he saw in the shop were naughty or nice. A woman was shown holding two bottles and trying to decide between them. Santa gestured towards her and glitter flew through the air and magically added gift-wrapping to one. The app then showed that a man in the shop was ‘naughty’, but he returned a dropped purse to another customer and the app changed to ‘nice’; Santa gasped, smiled and nodded. He then bought the alcohol he had chosen for each customer and signalled that he didn’t need a plastic bag because he had his red Santa sack. As he left the shop, text on-screen stated, “GIVING IS BETTER THAN RECEIVING”. The woman from the start of the ad came to the door of the shop and, smiling, watched him leave. The ad ended with the on-screen text “MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM Bargain Booze”. b. The Instagram ad featured the same content as ad (a).","The ASA challenged whether the ads breached the Code, because they featured Santa in a way which was likely to appeal particularly to people under 18 years of age.","Bestway Retail Ltd t/a Bargain Booze said that, whilst Santa was a fictitious character likely to appeal to those under 18 years of age, they believed his appeal was far broader than that. They said that Santa was a cultural icon, who also appealed to adults as well as children, as opposed to, a character such as elf on the shelf, which was particularly aimed at young children. They believed that Santa was not associated with youth culture, rather Santa was for everyone, young and old. Bargain Booze explained that, whilst the ads did feature a fictitious character who was likely to appeal to people under 18, they did not believe the depiction was done in a way that might encourage the young to drink. The ads did not show anyone drinking and no one who played a significant role was under 25 or shown behaving in an adolescent or juvenile manner. They highlighted the woman at the beginning of the ads holding her hand to her mouth in shock and excitement and said that she was not displaying juvenile behaviour, but rather a natural response that adults would also exhibit if they came face-to-face with Santa. Bargain Booze stated that it took its responsibilities very seriously and used its best endeavours to ensure that alcohol marketing does not appeal to people under 18 in a way which might encourage them to drink. They stated that they used targeting to boost the ads to a selected audience in the UK with a minimum age of 18 and provided their targeting to the ASA.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not be likely to appeal particularly to people under 18. Alcohol ads must not, therefore, have content that would appeal more to under-18s than it would to over-18s. The ASA acknowledged that the fictitious character of Father Christmas had appeal to people of all ages, and we did not consider his inclusion to be inherently problematic in ads for alcohol products. Notwithstanding that, we considered Christmas, and the traditions surrounding it, were likely to appeal to children. We therefore assessed whether the way in which the character of Father Christmas was presented in this ad, particularly appealed to those under 18. The ads contained many nostalgic Christmas elements, including Father Christmas in his full traditional costume and playful festive music. We considered that the overall impression of the ads was reminiscent of classic Christmas family films, which would be familiar, and therefore appealing, to children of all ages. Furthermore, we considered the exaggerated expression of surprise and wonder on the woman’s face when she saw Father Christmas reinforced that impression and was reflective of a child’s reaction to encountering Father Christmas, which we considered would particularly appeal to children. The ads also featured several magical elements; for example, Father Christmas was shown with a barometer-style app on a tablet which could determine whether individuals had been “naughty” or “nice”. We considered children would be familiar with Father Christmas monitoring their behaviour throughout the year, and as such, we considered that children would have a particular affinity with the barometer’s inclusion in the ad. Later in the ad, Father Christmas waved his hands, and a bottle of wine appeared magically wrapped, alongside another which appeared with a gift tag. We considered that showing Father Christmas in this way contributed to the impression that he was a magical figure and that would further appeal particularly to children. The ads also had a humorous tone which we considered would appeal to children. Father Christmas arrived in a red car, rather than a sleigh, and the car has the registration number “GIFT5 1981”. We also noted that the names of the people on Father Christmas’ naughty and nice list such as “MARY CHRISTMAS”, “CAROL SINGH”, “HOLLY” and “BILLY BAUBLES” were festive wordplays which we considered to be juvenile humour and would particularly appeal to children. Father Christmas was also shown paying by contactless technology and refusing a plastic bag in place of his red sack. We considered that this depicted the Father Christmas character in a humorous manner which was likely to appeal to young people. Whilst we acknowledged that many adults would also find those elements amusing, we considered they would particularly appeal to children. We considered that it may have been acceptable for the ads to appear in a medium where under-18s could be, for all intents and purposes, entirely excluded from the audience. That would apply in circumstances where those who saw the ad had been robustly age-verified as being 18 or older, such as through marketing lists that had been validated by payment data or credit checking. We acknowledged that the ads had been targeted to those who were aged 18 or over. However, we understood Facebook and Instagram did not require users to be validated through such means when they signed up to the platform. Furthermore, we understood that interest-based targeting had not been used to exclude groups of people more likely to be under 18 from the target audience of the ad. Because the ads were seen in an environment where users self-verified on customer sign-up and did not use robust age-verification, and interest based targeting had not been used, we considered that under-18s had not been entirely excluded from the audience. We considered that, had the character of Father Christmas been presented differently, the ads may not have particularly appealed to children. However, for the reasons stated above, we concluded that the ads had particular appeal to under-18s, and were therefore irresponsible, and breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 18.14 (Alcohol).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Bestway Retail Ltd t/a Bargain Booze that their ads for alcohol should not have particular appeal to under-18s.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/bestway-retail-ltd-a24-1271687-bestway-retail-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Haven Leisure Ltd,,"A paid-for Facebook ad and a website for Haven, a holiday company, seen on 22 December 2024. a. The paid-for Facebook ad featured an image of a swimming pool and a caravan holiday park. A caption on the post stated, “Have a blast on your next holiday with Haven. Sand, sea and buckets of fun await”. Text on the image stated, “Penally Court 4 nights from £55*”. Small print at the bottom of the ad stated, “*Price based on a Hideaway break in selected grades outside of school holidays”. The ad featured a click through link to ad (b). b. The website www.haven.com featured text, which stated, “Accommodation at Penally Court. Caravans 4 nights from £59”.","The complainant, who was unable to find dates at the advertised prices, challenged whether the claims “4 nights from £55” in ad (a) and “4 nights from £59” in ad (b) were misleading.","Haven Leisure Ltd said that at the time the ad was seen, there should have been five dates available for a ‘Hideaway break’ in 2025 at the advertised price points. Instead, only one break was available to book because two had sold out and two had been incorrectly priced too high. They explained that there was a lower availability of caravans at the Penally Court Holiday Park compared to their other parks, which they had not taken into account when making the price claim. That meant the advertised price points for Penally Court, in contrast to other Haven caravan parks, could have sold out after only one booking. Haven Leisure said that they had removed the price claims for Penally Court and would ensure promotional prices were dynamically updated in the future.","The ASA considered that consumers would have understood the claim in ad (a) “Penally Court 4 nights from £55” to mean that a significant proportion of 4-night breaks at that holiday park would have been available to book from £55. We further considered those who saw the claim in ad (b) “4 nights from £59” would have understood that there were a significant proportion of breaks which started from that price. It was not clear why the prices differed between the ads. We considered consumers who viewed the price claim in ad (a), before they clicked through to ad (b) and viewed a different price claim, would have likely been unsure of the specifics of the promotional offer. Notwithstanding the “from” price claim discrepancy between the ads, we still expected Haven Leisure to hold adequate evidence to substantiate those price claims. Because small print in ad (a) stated “Price based on a Hideaway break in selected grades outside of school holidays”, we also considered consumers would have expected to find the breaks available at the “from” prices across a range of dates outside of school holidays. We understood that, at the time the ads appeared, only one break was available to book at one of the advertised price points. We considered that meant there was not a significant number of breaks available at either of the price claims, plus they were not available across a range of dates. We acknowledged that was due to both Penally Court being a small caravan park and because of internal pricing errors. However, because only a small proportion of the available breaks were available at that price, which did not cover a suitable range of dates, we concluded that the claims “4 nights from £55” and “4 nights from £59” were misleading and could not be substantiated. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.17 and 3.22 (Prices).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Haven Leisure Ltd to ensure that a significant proportion of breaks were available at the advertised price, and across a range of dates, when using “from” price claims in the future.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/haven-leisure-ltd-a24-1272713-haven-leisure-ltd.html

ASA Ruling on Petchip.Network,,"Two paid-for Google search ads for Petchip.Network, an online microchip database, seen in November 2024: a. The first ad stated, “Enter Pet Microchip Number – Update Pet Microchip Details”. Additional text stated, “Register Dog Microchip, Register Cat Microchip, Change Microchip Info, Microchip Details”. b. The second ad stated “Update Pet Microchip Details – Enter Pet Microchip Number”. Additional text stated “Register Dog Microchip, Register Cat Microchip, Change Microchip Info, Microchip Details”.","The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), who believed consumers would understand from the ads that Petchip.Network was an approved database for registering microchipped pets, challenged whether the ads were misleading.",Petchip.Network did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Petchip.Network’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The ASA understood that the Microchipping of Cats and Dogs (England) Regulations 2023, and the equivalent regulations for Scotland and Wales, and legislation in Northern Ireland, stated that all dogs (in the UK) and cats (in England only) must be microchipped and registered on a compliant database in order to comply with the legal requirement for animals to be microchipped. We understood that there was no singular database for registering microchipped animals in the UK; instead, databases declared themselves compliant with the regulations. Databases which complied with the regulations were listed on the respective government website and regulated by Defra in England, and their counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We considered that, whilst consumers were likely to be aware that it was a legal requirement to register their pet’s microchip, they would not necessarily know that there were several different databases, or be aware of what standards a database should meet to comply with the relevant regulations. The ads included the claims “Update Pet Microchip Details”, “Register Dog Microchip” and “Register Cat Microchip”. We considered that consumers would interpret the ad to mean that Petchip.Network was an approved database for registering microchipped pets, and that by registering their pet’s microchip on Petchip.Network, they had complied with the legal requirement to do so. However, we understood that was not the case. We understood that Petchip.Network charged a fee for consumers to register their pet’s microchip information on the site. The consumer’s contact information would then be accessible to anyone who entered the relevant microchip details. We understood that Petchip.Network was not an approved database for the purposes of complying with the relevant regulations. We further understood from Defra that Petchip.Network was not, and had never sought to be, listed on the gov.uk website as a database which met English government standards. Given the above, we concluded that the ads were misleading.The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 3.9 (Qualifications).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Petchip.Network to ensure that they did not present their service in a way which was likely to misleadingly imply it was an approved database to comply with the legal requirements for the microchipping of cats and dogs. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/petchip-network-a24-1270884-petchip-network.html
ASA Ruling on Shenzhenshi Senyi Dianzi Shangwu Youxiangongsi t/a Plum-Marketing,,"A product listing for a magnetic building blocks toy set, seen on Amazon.co.uk on 28 October 2024, included images of young children playing with the product without adult supervision. The product’s name included text which stated, “Learning & Development Building Blocks Toys Gift for 3-7 Year Old Boys Girls”. Text at the top of the listing stated, “Manufacturer Minimum Age (MONTHS) 3”. Text in the “About this item” section of the listing stated, “The magnetic blocks kits are come [sic] with different shapes.Kids [sic] can create kinds of [sic] 2D plane shapes or 3D geometric structures […] The product complies with CE standard, so our magnetic block is safer than others”. Further down the listing, under the heading “Product Safety”, text stated, “Warning:To [sic] be used under the direct supervision of an adult […] Adult supervision recommended”. Beneath that, under the heading “Product information”, text stated, “Manufacturer recommended age 3 months and up”. A further product description near the bottom of the listing featured smaller text which stated, “Magnetic building blocks are the perfect gift for kids ages 3 and up […] Young children should be taken with the company [sic] of their parents to avoid accidental ingestion.” The first image of the product featured in the listing showed a young child playing with the magnetic blocks without an adult present. Further images showed other children of various ages playing with the product, some alone, some with adults present. Some images contained symbols with the ages “0-3” in them, which were visible when the image was clicked on and expanded.","Which?, the consumer protection group, challenged whether the ad was irresponsible and harmful because it featured images of children seemingly under the age of 3 years old using the product.","Plum Marketing believed it was appropriate for the listing’s images to show children using the product because it was a children’s toy. They said all children featured in the images were over three years old, and that the images displayed logos regarding the age suitability of the product. They believed the listing made clear that the product was intended for children aged three and over. Plum Marketing said the product had been designed to ensure that it was a safe size for children to use, and that individual components could not be swallowed. They said the product complied with relevant EU safety standards, and provided a testing certificate to demonstrate that it had met requirements to carry the CE mark. Plum Marketing said they took children’s safety seriously and understood their responsibility to produce safe products. They had received no negative feedback or complaints about the product from consumers. They said they would continue to ensure that their products met relevant safety standards in future. Amazon said that the product had been sold by a third-party seller, who had determined the content and the claims made on the product listing page. While Amazon had not received any direct complaints about the ad, they said they had removed the listing following review because it was not compliant with their internal policies.","The CAP Code required marketers to ensure their advertising was prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, and that ads, especially those depicting children, must not condone or encourage an unsafe practice. The Code also required that marketing communications featuring children must not contain anything likely to result in their physical harm. We understood that toys which contained small magnets were not safe for young children, due to the risk that the item could break, and the child could swallow the magnets. We also understood that injuries sustained from swallowing magnets could be very serious, sometimes life-threatening, and that a child who had swallowed magnets would need immediate medical assessment and might have required emergency surgery. We further acknowledged that statutory guidance on toy safety regulations published by the Office for Product Safety & Standards stated that toys must not jeopardise the safety or health of users when they were used as intended or in a foreseeable way, bearing in mind the behaviour of children. It also stated that the ability of the users must be taken into account, in particular in relation to toys intended for use by children under the age of three years. The product listing was for a magnetic building blocks toy set. Text in the product’s name at the top of the listing stated, “Building Blocks Toys Gift for 3-7 Year Old”, and the listing included images of children using the product. While we acknowledged Plum Marketing’s comments that the children shown in the images were over three years old, we considered that some of the children in the images had the appearance of being under the age of three years. We also noted that the listing’s main image, which consumers would have been presented with when first engaging with the ad, showed a very young-looking child playing with the blocks. Although sections of the listing stated that the product was suitable for children aged three and over, that was contradicted by further text within the listing, including wording at the top which stated, “Minimum Age (MONTHS) 3”. Further wording in the “Product information” section also stated, “Manufacturer recommended age 3 months and up”. In addition, while some of the images featured warning icons or text stating that the product was not suitable for children under the age of three, those were not visible unless the images were clicked on and fully expanded. We acknowledged that Plum Marketing had submitted the product for testing, and that it had been shown to be compliant with relevant EU standards for the use of children over the age of three. However, we considered that the ad’s contradictory wording regarding the product’s age suitability, combined with the images of children who appeared to be under the age of three years playing with the product, gave consumers the impression that magnetic blocks were suitable for that age group, when that was not the case. We concluded that the ad condoned an unsafe practice and featured very young children engaging with a toy which was likely to cause them physical harm, and that it therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.5 (Harm and offence) and 5.1 (Children).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Shenzhenshi Senyi Dianzi Shangwu Youxiangongsi t/a Plum Marketing to ensure that their future marketing communications were prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, and did not depict or condone an unsafe practice for children.

ASA Ruling on Shop TJC Ltd t/a Ideal World,,"A teleshopping presentation for Morphic watches, seen on Ideal World on 11 August 2024, featured two presenters describing and demonstrating the features of several watches, including the “Morphic 10ATM WR Black Dial Men’s Watch with Stainless Steel Strap in Silver Tone” and “Morphic 10ATM WR Blue Dial Men’s Watch with Stainless Steel Strap in Silver Tone”. One of the presenters said, “We’re going to do these at a fraction of the price. You can pay anywhere from to £1,800, £1,500, £1,200 […] This watch alone at £890 is a great buy […] First of all they’re incredibly expensive, ok, you pay a lot of money for a Morphic […] It’s £39.99 on four flexes and delivery of £1.99. You’ve got this for £159.99. Again, you’re saving a huge amount on these […] At £860 you can see why […] This is at £39.99, it’s on four flexes and reduced ‘p and p’, nearly £860 a watch, you’ve got this for £159.99”. During the presentation on-screen text stated, “IDEAL WORLD PRICE £159.99 P&P .99”and “4 X FLEXI-PAYMENTS OF £39.99”.","The complainant, who did not believe the watches were likely to retail at over £1,000, challenged whether the price statements were misleading and could be substantiated.","Shop TJC Ltd t/a Ideal World said that due to staff changes they were unable to provide the price comparison evidence they may have held at the time of the presentation in August 2024.They provided six examples of similar Morphic watches retailed by UK websites at around £440 as of 12 January 2025. They also provided an example from a USA-based website which showed a Morphic watch being sold at $229.99, with the ad also stating, “Retail $1,000.00”. They added that they were improving their training to ensure compliance with the BCAP Code and were taking steps to ensure that all documentary evidence for price comparisons was centrally available. They had also informed their presenters of the complaint.","The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the claim “You can pay anywhere from to £1,800, £1,500, £1,200” that the Morphic watches usually sold at those prices. We considered that consumers would therefore view the Ideal World price of £159.99 as a significant saving against the usual selling price, and the claim “We’re going to do these at a fraction of the price” added to this impression. CAP guidance on “Teleshopping price indications and comparisons” (the Guidance) explained that advertisers must ensure that comparative or illustrative prices, whether they were recommended retail prices (RRP), guide prices, or similar, were genuine and not likely to mislead. This applied both to explicit and implied comparisons. Broadcasters must hold documentary evidence to support price claims before transmission. The evidence did not substantiate the claim that the watches were usually sold at the significantly higher prices stated in the ad, either at the time it was broadcast or when the evidence was collated. In the absence of evidence to substantiate the price and savings claims, we concluded that the ad was misleading. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation), 3.18 (Prices), 3.39 and 3.40 (Price Comparisons).",The ad should not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Gemporia Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A teleshopping presentation for Gemporia on the Gems TV channel, seen on 1 October 2024, featured a presenter discussing the pearl market. The presenter showed a variety of pearls on screen from other retailers, with prices stated as ranging between $700 and $12,000 per pearl. He displayed a product listing from another retailer’s website, which he described as the “Biggest, most prestigious jewellery house in the world.” The product listing showed Tahitian pearl earrings in 18k White Gold, 9–10 mm, priced at £975. He stated, “These aren’t even 11 mm […] from 11 to 12 mm the price doubles. Say from 10 to11mm, it’s going to be £1,500, and then you double it, it becomes £3,000 […].” He then said, “We’re here in the midst of our twentieth-year anniversary, offering the only Tahitian pearls you’re going to see at this event. […] Magnificent, matched pairs of 12 mm top-grade triple-A Tahitian pearls.” He then started a 30-second clock, which appeared as a timer ticking on screen. Another presenter commented, “It is literally a chance of a lifetime to acquire the immaculate quality that we’re looking at on screen right now and they can be yours. Within seconds, you’ve just got to be so quick.” As the 30-second clock started again, she stated, “We don’t need to do this right now, we could take these pearls, sell them on, for probably 10 times the price you’re going to get today, at least. You could go on and do that, we can’t stop you doing that.” The main presenter then said, “If you’re going to, I’d buy two pairs, for goodness’ sake keep one.” The price started at £899. The camera went back to the previous presenter who said, “We’re better than anyone else, if we times this price by 10, right now, £8,999 we’re still better, because these are a matched pair of 12 mm, so times that price by 10 and were still way better, in our opinion.” The main presenter then started the clock again, “So we’re at £899, how low can we go? Let’s go straight down from here to £599 […] £300 coming off the price straight away.” He said, “Conceivably we could put a zero on that and we will still be market price.” He then informed viewers of another price reduction. He encouraged potential buyers to have the earrings seen by a professional and to have them insured, “So at £599, I’m telling you, go and get these valued and it should be double, and if it’s not, send them back […] But I’m still going lower.” The price was then reduced to £499 and then to £369 as the final price that customers paid for the earrings.",The complainant challenged whether the price:,,"The CAP guidance on “Teleshopping price indications and comparisons” (the Guidance) explained that advertisers must ensure that comparative or illustrative prices, whether they be Recommended Retail Prices (RRP), guide prices, or similar, are genuine and not likely to mislead and that this applied both to explicit and implied comparisons. The presenters made several different statements in the ad in relation to the resale and “market price” of the earrings. At the start of the presentation, when the price of the earrings was listed at £899, one of the presenters indicated that £8,999, ten times the advertised purchase price of the earrings, would still be below market value for the earrings. When the purchase price was shown on screen as £599, the presenter said that “We could put a zero on that and we will still be market price”, and later in the ad, the presenter stated that the same earrings would be valued at double the purchase price of £599. The purchase price was later dropped to £369, and at that point, the presenter stated that the earrings could be sold for 10 times more than that purchase price. Over the course of the ad, it was stated that the earrings were valued at £1,198, £3,690, £5,990 and £8,999. The ASA considered that viewers would understand those claims to mean that the earrings could be resold or valued at between £1,198 and £8,999. Gemporia provided a table from the pricing guide which they had used to determine the value of the earrings. The table included price ranges for Tahitian Black Cultured pearls that were rounded matched pairs. The table showed a range of prices in US dollars for those pearls according to their size (9 mm to 13 mm) and their quality (Commercial, Good, Fine and Extra Fine). For 12 mm matched pairs, the size of the earrings featured in the ad, the prices given in the table were between $345 for “Commercial” grade and $4,200 for an “Extra Fine” grade. We therefore understood that, according to the pricing guide, the maximum value for a similar pair of 12 mm earrings as those featured in the ad was $4,200. In any case, we were not provided with any substantiation to demonstrate the quality grade of the advertised earrings. Furthermore, we considered the maximum value given in the pricing guide was considerably lower than two of the “market prices” referenced in the ad, specifically the claims that the earrings were valued at £5,990 and £8,999. No further explanation was provided regarding the conflicting statements about the resale and market value of the earrings. In the absence of adequate evidence demonstrating that other retailers had sold similar 12 mm Tahitian pearl earrings of comparable quality, with the same carat and quantity of gold, at the prices mentioned in the ad in the last six months, we concluded that the claims had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached BCAP Code Rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation) and 3.18 (Prices). The Guidance stated that comparisons with competitors’ prices must be with the prices for identical, or substantially equivalent products and that broadcasters must hold documentary evidence to support price claims before transmission. Prior to when the advertised earrings were shown on screen, the presenter showed a different set of Tahitian pearl earrings, which he described as being from the “biggest, most prestigious jewellery house in the world”. They were priced at £975, and he discussed the size of those competitor pearl earrings and the impact that had on their value, stating “These aren’t even 11 mm […] from 11 to 12 mm the price doubles.” Later on in the presentation, the presenter referred to the size of the advertised earrings as 12mm and said, “We’re better than anyone else”. We considered that consumers would understand that the comparison with the competitor product was made to establish the value of the advertised pair of earrings, and because no further differences between the two products were discussed, we considered that implied that the competitor’s earrings were of comparable grade and quality to those being advertised. We were not provided with any evidence to demonstrate that the advertised earrings were of comparable grade and quality to the competitor's product. We expected this assessment to encompass both the gold and the pearls, considering factors such as the value of the gold, and the lustre, surface quality and matching of the pearls. We noted from Gemporia’s response that they believed the competitor product was of lower quality due to the difference in pearl size. However, we understood that the competitor’s product contained 18k white gold while the earrings advertised contained 9k gold, which meant the competitor’s product was higher in gold content, more durable and, therefore, would be higher in value. We therefore considered that the two pairs of earrings were neither identical nor substantially equivalent to justify comparing them with each other. On that basis, we concluded the basis of the price comparison had not been made clear. On that point, the ad breached BCAP Code Rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) 3.9 (Substantiation), 3.18 (Prices), 3.33, 3.35 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors) and 3.39 (Price Comparisons).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Gemporia Ltd to ensure they held adequate evidence to substantiate price statements, including evidence relating to the usual selling price of their products.

ASA Ruling on Maki Online Services Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An email from Nino Apply, sent on 29 November 2024, with the subject line “Your BRP Card expires next month” stated, “ACTION REQUIRED: Don’t Lose Your Right to Stay in the UK! We are reaching out to notify you of a critical issue regarding your Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) […] without immediate action, you risk losing your legal right to live and work in the UK”. Further text stated, “An expired BRP may restrict your access to vital services such as healthcare […] Failing to renew your BRP could result in fines, deportation, or other severe penalties”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad: 1. was misleading in relation to the stated consequences of failing to renew a BRP; and 2. misleadingly omitted the fact that an eVisa could be obtained for free through the Government website.,Maki Online Services Ltd t/a Nino Apply said that they had stopped any marketing campaigns that matched the complaint.,"A Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) was a physical document which could be used to confirm a person’s identity, right to study and right to any public services they were entitled to in the UK. The ASA understood that, due to the UK Government’s intention to move to digital proof of immigration status, any BRP issued after 1 January 2020 was given an expiry date no later than 31 December 2024, even if the expiration of the visa was after that date. After 31 December 2024, BRPs were replaced by eVisas, an online record of immigration status.We understood that the expiration of the BRP card did not affect the card holder’s immigration status. Unless the holder’s permission to remain in the UK also expired on 31 December 2024, the expiry date only related to the expiry of the card.We considered that the statements, “Don’t Lose Your Right to Stay in the UK” and “without immediate action, you risk losing your legal right to live and work in the UK” in the ad would be understood to mean that the card holder’s right to stay in the UK and access services would stop on 31 December 2024 when their BRP card expired. We understood that for the majority of BRP holders that would not be the case, and their immigration status would be unaffected. We acknowledged that BRP card holders who used the BRP to evidence their UK immigration status would potentially face difficulty in demonstrating their status if they had not registered for an eVisa before 1 January 2025. However, that was distinct from their right to live and work in the UK.Because we considered that the overall impression of the ad was that the immigration status of BRP card holders would change when the card expired, whereas in the majority of cases this was not likely to be the case, we concluded the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading advertising). We understood that Nino Apply offered a consultation service to assist with the process of obtaining an eVisa. Nino Apply charged for the service, and the eVisa was available for free when applied for directly from the Home Office via the official gov.uk website.We acknowledged that Nino Apply did not claim to be official or endorsed by the Government. However, we considered that many consumers would not be aware that the eVisa could be obtained for free via the Government’s website. The ad should therefore have made it clear that they charged a premium for their consultation service, and that the eVisa could be obtained for free from the gov.uk website. Because the ad did not make clear that the eVisa was available for free from the Home Office and that the advertiser levied an additional charge for their consultation service, we concluded that the ad misleadingly omitted material information. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Maki Online Services Ltd t/a Nino Apply to ensure that they did not mislead consumers by misrepresenting the consequences of not renewing an expired document.

ASA Ruling on EDF Energy Ltd,,"A radio ad for energy supplier EDF, heard on 7 September 2024, stated, “Your electricity bill could be nil. Yep, nothing. Because when you install solar panels and a battery with EDF, you don’t just get electricity when it’s sunny, you can store it for a rainy day too. EDF, change is in our power. For potential zero pound bills, buy ten to twelve of our solar panels, a battery, and join Empower Exclusive […]”.","The complainants challenged whether the claim “you don’t just get electricity when it’s sunny, you can store it for a rainy day too” was misleading because they believed the solar panels and battery would not generate and store enough power to provide electricity during the winter months.","EDF Energy Ltd t/a EDF said the ad claimed that electricity generated while it was sunny could be stored for use on another, less sunny, day. There was nothing in the claim that implied the electricity stored would be sufficient to meet months’ worth of usage during the darker months, and they would not expect consumers to understand the claim in that way since it would not be a credible claim. The claim was that the power generated on one day could be stored and used on a different day, which was factually correct. EDF said on an average summer day a typical household would use approximately 5.92 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, solar panels would generate an average of 14.1 kWh of energy (calculated as the average of 12.82 kWh and 15.39 kWh – the accepted range during sunny days), and the battery could consistently store 5.32 kWh of energy. Those figures demonstrated that even after taking into account daily usage, the panels and battery would be able to store surplus energy that could be used on a different day that should be sufficient to meet the overwhelming majority of that consumer’s usage on a separate day, even if the panels did not generate anything at all on that separate day. They said that scenario was unlikely to occur since even during the worst days during the winter period the panels are still likely to generate around 1.6 kWh of power, and possibly up to around 1.97 kWh.EDF said the figure 5.92kWh was based on the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem)’s 2023 Typical Domestic Consumption Values (TDCVs) review. The TDCVs were industry standard values for the annual electricity usage of a typical domestic user. The 2023 review included a range of households of one to three people with an annual power use of between 1,800 kWh (4.9 kWh per day) and 2,700 kWh (7.4 kWh per day). EDF had adopted 2,161 kWh per year (5.92 kWh per day) for a sunny day. Panel generation figures had been calculated in accordance with MSC’s Solar PV Standard (MIS-3002). MSC certified low-carbon products and installations used to produce electricity and heat from renewable sources in the UK. The figure 14.1 kWh had been calculated using the formula set out in MSC’s MIS-3002 guidance .Radiocentre endorsed EDF’s response.","The ad made the claim “Your electricity bill could be nil”, which was followed by the claim that consumers could store energy generated by their solar panels on sunny days “for a rainy day”. The ASA considered consumers would understand from those claims that if they bought 10 to 12 EDF solar panels and a battery, surplus energy generated by the panels on sunny days could be stored in the battery for use on days when it was too dark for the panels to generate enough power to meet their needs. In the context of the ad, we considered consumers would understand the phrase “rainy day” as a general period of time where the sun shone less. In that context we considered consumers would understand from the ad that any given monthly electricity bill could be reduced to nil, since any short fall in power generated by the panels on darker days would be met by the energy stored in the battery. Ofgem’s 2023 Decision on TDCVs, its most recent, stated a low electricity household usage of 1,800 kWh (4.93 kWh per day), medium usage of 2,700 kWh (7.39 kWh per day), and high usage of 4,100 kWh (11.23 kWh per day). We understood the “medium” usage figure reflected the median household consumption, whereas the “low” and “high” usage groups represented lower and higher quartiles of household consumption. EDF had calculated average daily consumption on the basis of the lower quartile and the median, which gave a lower daily average consumption (5.92 kWh) than the median (7.39 kWh). Solar panels generated an average of 14.1 kWh of energy on sunny days, and typically between 1.6 kWh and 1.97 kWh on the darkest days. We understood a battery could store around 5.32 kWh of energy, less than the Ofgem-stated median average daily consumption.While it was possible there would be days when an energy deficit could be balanced out by the power stored in the battery, that power was unlikely to be sufficient to balance a consumer’s usage, such that they had nothing to pay. It was therefore unlikely that any given bill, outside of the sunnier months of the year, would be reduced to nil as a result of the advertised tariff. While EDF said the claim had been intended literally as meaning that energy stored in the battery one day could be used on the next consecutive day, that had not been included in the ad. Furthermore, the claims had been based on calculations that used average figures, taken from the Ofgem Decision and an industry standard calculation, the former based on households of one to three people. They were therefore not necessarily representative of what a consumer would achieve. That information had also not been included in the ad. We considered that both of those pieces of information were material to consumers’ understanding of the ad and so should have been made clear. For those reasons we concluded the ad was likely to mislead. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1, 3.2 (Misleading advertising), and 3.9 (Substantiation).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told EDF Energy Ltd t/a EDF to ensure future ads made clear the basis of any claims, where the omission of that information was likely to mislead.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/edf-energy-ltd-g24-1260840-edf-energy-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Floor Design Ltd t/a Flooring by Nature,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A website for Flooring by Nature, a carpet and flooring retailer, www.flooringbynature.co.uk, seen on 25 July 2024, featured a product listing for a “Wool Carpet” with text at the top that stated, “Their eco credentials mean they provide a fantastic, sustainable alternative to synthetic carpets […].

Further down the page, under the heading “Sustainable Wool Carpets to Suit your Home”, text stated, “Our sustainable wool carpets are woven from 100% natural wool, many ranges use undyed yarn so are chemical free, making them completely eco-friendly.

Wool carpets also biodegrade at the end of their lives, meaning they are not adding to the ever-growing problem of excess waste, something which we take very seriously”.",,"Floor Design Ltd t/a Flooring by Nature said they had reviewed and amended their website in order to make the claims clearer and to signpost towards their Info Hub and FAQ pages. They said it was commonplace in the flooring industry for carpets to be referred to by their pile content, regardless of what type of backing they had. A carpet’s backing was a thin layer generally made of polypropylene, polyamide or a plant-based material such as jute or cotton. They said the most popular floors in the UK were 100% man-made fibre carpets and 100% vinyl hard flooring, both made from plastic. They aimed to offer more eco-friendly or sustainable alternatives, and their carpet piles were comprised of 100% wool or natural fibre. 1. Flooring by Nature said there was widespread acceptance that wool was a sustainable material. The addition of a plastic backing did not inherently make the carpet environmentally unfriendly or unsustainable. All but one of their carpet ranges with a plastic backing used a low-weight backing that required significantly less raw materials to produce than a standard plastic backing. As consumers had different priorities in terms of environmental impact, the raw materials for non-plastic backing were sourced from outside the UK and resultingly had higher manufacturing miles, whereas plastic backings were often manufactured within the UK and may have lower manufacturing miles. Carpets with less plastic and more renewable materials were more eco-friendly and more sustainable than carpets made entirely from plastic. They provided a journal article to support that point. They said consumers had distinct interpretations of what the terms “eco-friendly” and “sustainable” meant, and they were confident their products would be considered eco-friendly by the vast majority of their customers. They said there were many metrics which could assess a product’s eco-friendliness or sustainability, and that listings for each of their individual products made clear the key attributes of that product. 2. Flooring by Nature said they made clear on individual listing pages which carpets were biodegradable, and that they only applied the term to plastic-free products. Those products were considered biodegradable as they were made from plant or animal fibres and if left to nature would biodegrade. They said they did not make claims in relation to how long it would take for their carpet to biodegrade, and nor did they realistically believe a customer would intend to allow their carpet to biodegrade at the end of its useful life. They said carpets were generally sent for incineration in a waste to energy facility, and due to waste treatment rules, carpets were rarely sent to landfill. They said that for most consumers carpets were an infrequent and high value purchase, where they spent time considering their choices and understanding the information provided on each individual range as well as accessing the additional content in the FAQ and Info Hub sections of the website. Over 90% of their customers ordered free product samples prior to ordering, and the average timescale from sample order to purchase of a carpet was over 30 days, indicating it was a considered purchase and unlikely to be influenced by a small amount of content on their website.","The CAP Code stated that absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation, but that claims such as “greener” could be justified if the advertised product or service provided a total environmental benefit over that of the advertiser’s previous product or service or competitor products or services and the basis of the comparison was clear. Additionally, marketers must base claims on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise, and must make clear the limits of the life cycle. The ASA acknowledged the flooring industry referred to carpets by the material their pile was made from, regardless of what type of backing they had. Unless stated otherwise, we considered consumers would understand claims made about the carpet’s environmental impact as accounting for all of their components, including the backing. We considered that consumers would interpret the claim “sustainable alternative to synthetic carpets” as meaning that all of Flooring by Nature’s woollen carpets had a lower environmental impact than that of a synthetic carpet when considering the full life cycle of each product. We reviewed the journal article provided, which outlined the estimated carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions of wool and nylon carpets in the United States over their full life cycle. The article detailed the production of a 0.09 square metre of wool carpet and the same size of nylon carpet. The former had an estimated usage period of 25 years which resulted in 6.35 kg CO2e, and the latter had an estimated usage period of 11 years which resulted in 4.8 kg CO2e. Over a 25-year period, usage of a nylon carpet would result in more CO2e than a wool carpet, meaning in the longer-term usage of woollen carpets produced less CO2e. The article stated due to wool’s recyclability it was one of the most environmentally friendly floor covering products available. However, the article did not examine Flooring by Nature’s own woollen carpets and their full life cycle from production to disposal, and only compared pile made from wool or nylon and did not account for other synthetic materials such as polyester. For those reasons the evidence did not adequately substantiate the claim “sustainable alternative to synthetic carpets”. We further considered the claim “eco-friendly” would be understood as meaning the carpets were not harmful to the environment at any point during their full life cycle. We therefore expected to see a high level of substantiation to support that claim. However, we had not seen evidence to support the claim, as it appeared, to that standard. As we had not seen evidence that adequately substantiated the claims “sustainable alternative to synthetic carpets” and “eco-friendly” we therefore concluded they were likely to mislead. On that point the ad, breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), and 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 (Environmental claims). Flooring by Nature said that most carpets were incinerated at the end of their useful life. We considered consumers would understand the claim “Wool carpets also biodegrade at the end of their lives” as meaning all of the wool carpets shown, including the pile and the backing, were biodegradable, and stood a reasonable chance of biodegrading, at their likely-end-of-life destination. We acknowledged that the wool used in the carpet’s pile could biodegrade, and that in making the claim Flooring by Nature had intended that it only refer to the woollen pile in the carpet, rather than the backing, which in some instances was made from the synthetic materials polypropylene or polyamide. However, for the carpets with a polypropylene or polyamide backing, and those with a cotton backing which could biodegrade, the ad did not make clear how to dispose of them, such as by including information about the environment they needed to be placed within to breakdown. We considered that information would be important to ensuring the product reached a suitable end-of-life destination in which it would successfully biodegrade. For that reason, we considered that information was material to consumers’ understanding of the claim and therefore should have been included in the ad. The ad had suggested all of the carpets and their components, were biodegradable, and had not included sufficient information about how to dispose of them to successfully biodegrade. We therefore concluded it was likely to mislead. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 11.1, and 11.2 (Environmental claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Floor Design Ltd t/a Flooring by Nature to ensure they held suitably robust substantiation for environmental claims, related to the full life cycle of a product where relevant. We also told them to ensure their ads made clear the actions consumers needed to take for the product to successfully biodegrade, and to make clear when they were only referring to part of a carpet.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/floor-design-ltd-a24-1253521-floor-design-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Intelligent Lending Ltd t/a Ocean Finance,"These ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Meta ad and display ad for Ocean Finance credit card, seen on 27 November 2024: a. The paid-for Meta ad featured an image of an Ocean credit card with the text, “IT’S BLACK FRIDAY”. “BLACK” was crossed out and replaced with “just”. Further text stated, “Up to £8,000 credit limit”, “Spend savvy” and “Borrow and spend responsibly”. The caption stated, “Check your eligibility for our credit cards. Up to £8,000 credit limit. Get an answer in 60 seconds. Checking won’t affect your credit score”. b. The display ad also featured the text, “IT’S BLACK FRIDAY”. “BLACK” was crossed out and replaced with “just”. Further text stated, “Credit Limit up to £8,000. Ocean. Check your eligibility in 60 seconds for our Credit Cards. No impact on your Credit Score ”.",The ASA challenged whether the ads were irresponsible because they encouraged consumers to spend regularly on non-essential purchases on a credit card.,"Intelligent Lending Ltd said the ads were designed to discourage irresponsible spending and to prompt consumers to give consideration before spending. The word “BLACK” was replaced with “just” and was designed to appear as a handwritten correction to reinforce the message that Black Friday should be treated as any other day. They said, “Just Friday” was meant to reduce the perceived need to rush into purchases or treat it as an extraordinary event. The capitalisation of “BLACK” and removal of capitalisation in “just” was intended to be a reminder that while consumers may indeed use credit, this should be done with caution, as it was just another day and not a special occasion. Additionally, the ads included the messages “Borrow and spend responsibly” and “Spend savvy”, which emphasised the importance of informed decision-making when it came to spending, both during Black Friday and at any other time, and reinforced their commitment to promoting responsible financial behaviour. The messages highlighted the importance of thoughtful spending and encouraged consumers to avoid impulsively purchasing non-essential items during the limited time event. Along with “Just Friday”, these messages were intended to reduce ‘hype’, and caution against impulsive purchasing. Given that, they did not consider that the messaging in the ads encouraged regular or unnecessary spending on a credit card. They said the credit limit and eligibility check information mentioned in the ads was intended to convey factual details about the product and service. The nature of the product being a credit-building card was considered in all their promotions and further reinforced their message in the campaign to discourage unnecessary spending.","The CAP Code required marketers to ensure advertising was prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society.The ASA noted Intelligent Lending’s comment that the addition of “just” with “BLACK” crossed out was intended as a message that Black Friday should be treated as any other day. We also noted that “Just Friday” was intended to reduce the perceived need to rush into purchases or to treat Black Friday as an extraordinary event. However, we considered the reference to Black Friday, which was in capital letters, put emphasis on using a credit product for the event, which typically offered savings on predominantly non-essential products such as technology, beauty and clothing. In addition, we considered the addition of “just”, to read “it’s just Friday”, was likely to be understood to mean that consumers should regularly spend money on a credit card ‘just because’ it was a Friday. As such, we considered the reference to regularly spending in such a way on a Friday, a day sometimes seen as a time for reward after the working week, was likely to be understood as encouraging consumers to apply for the credit card just to treat themselves. We acknowledged Intelligent Lending’s comment that the statements “Borrow and spend responsibly” in both ads, and “Spend savvy” in ad (a), were intended to reinforce their commitment to promoting responsible financial behaviour and not overspending and were meant to encourage consumers to avoid impulsively purchasing non-essential items. However, we considered those statements were not sufficient to counteract the main message in the ads. Because we considered the ads encouraged consumers to spend regularly on non-essential purchases using a credit card, we concluded they were irresponsible. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Intelligent Lending Ltd to ensure that future ads did not irresponsibly encourage consumers to spend regularly on non-essential purchases using a credit card.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/intelligent-lending-ltd-a24-1270898-intelligent-lending-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Meggan Kirkland,"Summary of council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An Instagram post by Meggan Kirkland (@meggangrubb), posted on 11 November 2024, included a caption which stated, “And for the fifth year running, we’re officially back with our huge Christmas GIVEAWAY!! […] SO to enter my annual rather large festive giveaway this year and to be in with the chance of winning over £4000 worth of goodies, all you need to do is […]”, a list of bullet points stated, “like this post + tag a friend in the comments”, “subscribe to my YouTube channel - linked in my bio”, “make sure you’re following my insta @meggangrubb” and “share this post to your story for a bonus entry! Giveaway is open worldwide + ends 1st December 2024 at midnight! Good luck girlies!! […] I will be the only person announcing the winner so please ignore any accounts that may contact you falsely”.","The complainant challenged whether the promotion breached the Code because: 1. the terms and conditions were not accessible to participants; and 2. they believed it was not administered fairly because it was not possible to track who had shared the post as an Instagram Story, and who would therefore qualify for a bonus entry.","1. Meggan Kirkland’s representative said they would pin the terms and conditions to the post in future promotions. 2. Meggan Kirkland’s representative said regarding the condition that entrants could share the post to their story for a bonus entry, it was understood that for entrants with private Instagram accounts, story shares could not be directly verified due to platform restrictions. However, sharing the post to Instagram Stories was clearly outlined as a bonus entry rather than a mandatory requirement. That ensured that such entries did not compromise the fairness of the selection process, as they were supplementary to the core entry criteria. They said they would be able to see if an account had mentioned Meggan within her DM (direct message) requests and she could ask for a screenshot as proof if needed. They said Meggan checked the bonus entries when they appeared in her DM requests.They said Meggan carefully reviewed and verified all requirements that could be checked via Instagram’s tools, such as liking the post, tagging a friend and following @meggangrubb. They used an online tool to randomly select the winner from the comments after ensuring these key elements were met, while keeping the process fair, user-friendly and considerate of participants’ privacy.","The CAP Code stated that participants must be able to retain conditions or easily access them throughout the promotion. In addition, prize promotions must specify on all marketing communications or other material referring to them, where the omission of the information was likely to mislead, details including any restriction on the number of entries, how and when winners would be notified of results and any intention to use winners in post-event publicity.We noted that the post contained the conditions, “Giveaway is open worldwide + ends 1st December 2024 at midnight”. However, it did not contain or provide any information on where to find additional conditions, such as any restriction on the number of entries, specifically how and when winners would be notified and any intention to use winners in publicity. We welcomed Meggan Kirkland’s willingness to make the full terms and conditions accessible to entrants in future promotions, however, at the time the promotion was posted, they were not displayed or otherwise signposted. We considered that any condition which affected entry, and the results of the promotion, would be relevant to entrants when making a decision to take part in the promotion and should be clearly made available. Therefore, because the terms and conditions were not clear before, or at the time of entry, and easily accessible throughout the promotion, the ad breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.28, 8.28.1, 8.28.4 and 8.28.9 (Prize promotions). The CAP Code required promoters to conduct their promotions equitably, promptly and efficiently and be seen to deal fairly and honourably with participants and potential participants. Promoters were required to avoid causing unnecessary disappointment. We understood that the promotion allowed entrants to qualify for a bonus entry by sharing the promotional post as an Instagram Story. We acknowledged that sharing the post to Instagram Stories was outlined as a bonus entry rather than a mandatory requirement and understood that Meggan checked the bonus entries when they appeared in her DM requests. However, Meggan’s representative confirmed that for entrants with private Instagram accounts, story shares could not be directly verified due to platform restrictions. We therefore considered it would not be possible for Meggan to identify whether the entrants with private Instagram accounts had qualified for a bonus entry. We noted that Meggan Kirkland had used Instagram’s tools to review and verify the requirements that could be checked, such as liking the post, tagging a friend and following @meggangrubb and that they used an independent third-party website to randomly select the winner from the comments after ensuring some of the entry requirements were met. However, we understood that data from the post would not show who had shared the post as an Instagram Story from a private account. We therefore considered that entrants who shared the post as a story from a private Instagram account would not increase their chances of winning the prize by doing so.As such, we concluded that the promotion was not administered fairly and therefore breached the Code.

ASA Ruling on Secret Escapes Ltd,,"A website for Secret Escapes, www.secretescapes.com, seen on 4 September 2024, featured a listing that stated, “Sublime seaside hotel in buzzy Bournemouth”, “Time-limited”, “up to -46% today”, and “From £135 £233 [crossed out] per room per night”. Two “i” symbols featured further text when hovered over that stated “On selected offers. The discount percentage is the maximum discount value we’ve found across a significant proportion of our dates in comparison to the hotel’s standard rate or the [competitor] rate for this offer. The strike through price is illustrative of that maximum discount. See Offer Details for full information”. Further text under “Offer Details” stated, “Our discount: The specified discount is calculated regularly and based on the hotel’s own prices or those on comparable booking portals”.",The complainant challenged whether the claim “up to -46% today” was misleading and could be substantiated.,"Secret Escapes Ltd said that the “from” price and the “up to” discount percentage were available across a significant number of check-in dates within the offer period. They explained that dates with the cheapest “from” price would not necessarily also have the biggest percentage discount. Whilst they acknowledged the “from” and “up to” offers were positioned next to each other, they believed that the formatting and layout differences between the offers distinguished them from each other. They provided a spreadsheet which contained the price and percentage discount savings for all of the rooms and dates they had available during the offer period. Secret Escapes explained that, when they calculated savings for offers, they accounted for additional benefits which were not available on other sites, such as late check-out and dining credits. They highlighted that the explanatory text referred to the discount “value” rather than the price, as they were comparing value where there was no direct comparison available. They also stated that the term “offer” referred to the additional benefits included in the comparison, rather than just the cost of the room. In relation to the offer featured in the ad, they checked availability and prices from 2 August 2024 to 31 December 2024 against a competitor and were compared in terms of room type and date. They stated that they advertised four different offers for the hotel, which all included 1pm late check-out, valued at £20. Since the competitor did not have the 1pm late check-out included in its offer, they manually added £20 to the price that the competitor offered before calculating the total discount. Secret Escapes highlighted that the ad included two icons, located near the “from” price and percentage discount saving, which, when hovered over, displayed further information explaining how each was calculated. They stated the text directed customers to the “Offer Details” button which, when clicked on, included a list of the relevant included benefits. Secret Escapes stated that they took transparent pricing practices seriously, and had reviewed their website following receipt of the complaint to ensure their promotions were clear to consumers. They explained that they had amended the explanatory wording next to the “up to” and “from” offers to make it clear that the value of additional benefits was included in the calculated discount. They stated that they had already planned a review of the presentation of their prices, and were happy to work with the ASA in the future to ensure consumers were not misled.","Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “Up to -46%” to mean that Secret Escapes offered hotel stays with a discount of up to 46% compared to the usual selling price of the same hotel stay on the hotel’s own website. Because the “from” price and “up to” percentage discount claim were displayed directly next to each other in the ad, we considered consumers would understand that the “up to” percentage discount directly related to the “from” price shown, and that the cost of £135 a night represented a 46% discount on the hotel stay. We considered that consumers would understand the comparison to be against the hotel’s standard rate, and that impression was likely to be reinforced by the explanatory text “discount percentage is the maximum discount value we’ve found… in comparison to the hotel’s standard rate or the [competitor] rate”. We understood that the price £135 represented a 42% discount from the room rate of £233 rather than 46%, and that there was no correlation between the “from” price and the “up to” percentage discount seen in the ad. We acknowledged that there were two explanatory icons next to the “up to” percentage discount and “from” price. However, we considered that the text itself did not make clear that the two figures did not relate to each other. The differences in the font and layout of the “up to” and “from” claims were not significant enough to dispel the assumption that they related to each other. We therefore considered that the presentation of the claims was misleading.In addition, we understood that Secret Escapes added the value of additional benefits they offered to the usual selling price of the room on competitor sites and calculated the percentage discount from that higher figure. That meant the figure they had used as a reference for the discount was not the actual figure being charged to consumers as the standard rate for the room. We therefore considered that, due to the addition of the cost of extra benefits such as late check-out, the percentage discount figure did not reflect the true discount that customers would receive compared to the standard price of the room. Because the percentage discount had not been calculated against the standard price of the hotel room, and the presentation of the “from” price and the percentage discount suggested they related to the same figure, we concluded that the savings claims were misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.22 (Prices) and 3.39 (Price comparisons).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Secret Escapes Ltd to ensure that price comparisons were not misleading, for example through the addition of the cost of extra benefits to a comparative price. We also told them to make the basis of price comparisons clear in their advertising.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/secret-escapes-ltd-a24-1258783-secret-escapes-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Supplylife Group Ltd t/a SUPPLYlife,One sponsored Instagram ad was also investigated and resolved informally with the advertiser’s agreement to remove it.,"A website for Supply Life, https://supplylife.com, a retailer of food intolerance tests, originally seen in December 2022 stated, “Make the change your body needs. If you’re suffering from food related Energy dips, Unwanted-weight, Bloating, Diarrhoea, Constipation, IBS, our process has helped improve so many lives. Our simple process will help you to notice a difference within just days of making dietary changes. Our qualified nutritionists will work closely with you to ensure the changes we suggest fit within your lifestyle and we will continue to offer you up to 30 days of nutrition support”.","The complainant, who understood that a blood test could not identify food intolerances or their symptoms, challenged whether the efficacy claims for the test to help with energy dips, unwanted weight and IBS symptoms could be substantiated.","Supplylife Group Ltd t/a Supply Life provided five studies and an expert opinion to support the claims. They also provided comments from three NHS doctors about the studies and the evidence submitted. They further submitted results from an online customer survey. The 1585 eligible respondents were made up of those who were tested for food intolerances, were sent a nutritional advice form and who rang Supply Life’s helpline to ask questions about the results and received advice. The results from the survey showed that 1488 answered “completely”, “not completely but significantly” or “moderately” to best describe the effect of Supply Life’s service on alleviating their symptoms versus 97 who said “not at all”. In response to the question “Did you notice a benefit to your symptoms from following the report and/or nutritional support?”, 1009 said “definitely”, 284 “probably”, 197 “possibly” and 95 said “no”. When asked “What symptoms were you trying to alleviate…”, 603 stated food related energy dips, 605 weight, 1145 bloating, 388 diarrhoea, 290 constipation and 588 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Those surveyed were also asked about adherence to the plan and whether lifestyle changes had been made as a result of the report, amongst other questions. Supply Life had employed a chartered statistician to consider the survey’s design and whether it was strong enough to make accurate conclusions. In addition, the statistician had been asked to carry out a statistical evaluation of the survey responses and see whether or not those responses supported the ad. The statistician concluded the survey’s content had some limited issues but was overall adequate for the purpose intended. They said based on the survey answers it was accurate to state that for those who received a report and nutritional advice and followed completely the recommendations for at least six weeks, that 86% stated they had definitely seen a benefit to their symptoms. If respondents said they had made lifestyle changes, as well as following the recommendations completely for at least six weeks then those who reported benefits rose to 94%.Supply Life had further employed an expert, a Practitioner Health Psychologist and a Chartered Scientist, to review the statistician’s report, as well as the five studies to support the claims and the expert opinion.Supply Life said they believed the ad was compliant with the Code. Going forward, however, they would remove the claims ""within days"" and ""energy related food dips"". They would also make the ad clearer that it was based on the results of their consumer survey and not primary clinical research trials.","The ASA understood the NHS defined a food intolerance to be “difficulty digesting certain foods or ingredients in food”, and that the recommended way to identify the source of a food intolerance was to eliminate specific foods from a diet and monitor symptoms. The full programme offered by the advertiser at the time the ad appeared involved the testing of a diluted blood sample against extracts in laboratory conditions. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody results for each extract were measured and an elimination diet was informed by the results. The ad stated, “Make the change your body needs. If you’re suffering from food related Energy dips, Unwanted-weight, Bloating, Diarrhoea, Constipation, IBS, our process has helped improve so many lives”. We considered that consumers were likely to understand the references to the specific symptoms, alongside the claims “improving so many lives” and “Make the change your body needs”, to mean that taking an IgG test and implementing the subsequent elimination diet informed by that test, would, supported by the optional nutritional and lifestyle advice referred to in the ad, identify the food responsible for the symptoms and reduce or resolve those symptoms. That was supported by further text that stated, “Our simple process will help you to notice a difference within just days of making dietary changes”. We understood the NHS did not currently recommend home tests for food intolerances. In addition, the British Dietetic Association (BDA) stated that there was no convincing evidence to support IgG blood tests and did not recommend them as a diagnostic tool. However, we reviewed the specific evidence submitted by Supply Life in support of their service and took expert advice. Supply Life provided a literature review and five studies, four focused on IBS and its symptoms, one of which also reported on weight loss and a second also on fatigue after meals. The fifth study was solely concerned with weight loss for those who had IBS. The literature review was a non-systematic review of published works and studies relating to IgG testing and an elimination diet. The report outlined the background to adverse food reactions, immunological mechanisms in the body, the role of IgG antibodies and the links of elevated IgG antibodies to specific conditions, including IBS, and studies that have evaluated IgG testing and an elimination diet. Because the report was not a systematic review or a primary research study, while it was indicative, it did not represent evidence to substantiate the claims. A preliminary observational study involved 80 patients with symptoms of delayed food allergies. They were subjected to an IgG test and had foods for which they tested positive eliminated from their diet. A range of symptoms, including those consistent with IBS and fatigue after meals, were then measured. While all symptoms showed improvement, there was no control group or randomisation, the number of participants was relatively small and it was unclear how the results had been measured. Further to that, the study had one person acting as both assessor and observer, at all stages of the study. A second observational study looked at 22 professional athletes who took part in a three-month elimination diet based on the results of an IgG food intolerance test. The results looked at gastrointestinal symptoms, fat percentage, heart rate and flexibility. Gastrointestinal symptoms, measured by general and athlete-specific questionnaires, showed significant positive changes. Fat percentages of the athletes also decreased significantly. There was however no control group in the study, and no randomisation. The sample size was small and by only looking at professional athletes, was not representative of the wider population. The athletes were also shown before the study not to be consuming enough calories, vitamins and minerals. That was then corrected with the nutritional help given with the elimination diet, but it was unclear if the results were because of this correction or the IgG testing and elimination diet alone. A randomised controlled trial of 150 patients with IBS divided participants into one group who were given an elimination diet based on their IgG testing, and a control group whose food exclusions were not based on those for which they had raised IgG antibodies according to the test. IBS symptoms were scored on a scale of 0 to 500. At 12 weeks, participants’ scores in the intervention group had reduced by 100 points and in the control group by 61.5 points. Although there were some concerns regarding the adequacy of the blinding and the control, overall it was a well-conducted study that suggested testing IgG antibodies could have a role in helping IBS patients identify candidate foods for elimination. A double-blind randomised control trial of 60 participants, looked to manage IBS and headaches, where the participants were split into three groups. Over a period of 14 weeks, one group had an elimination diet informed by IgG testing, the second had probiotics and the third had probiotics and an elimination diet informed by IgG testing. The outcomes relating to IBS, abdominal distention and bowel habit, measured by an IBS questionnaire, showed improvements described by the authors as “remarkable” for bowel habit but only the group with probiotics and the elimination diet showed improvement in abdominal distention. While the study stated participants were randomised and double blinding occurred, no details were provided as to how that had been done. In addition, the overall sample size and therefore the group sizes were small. Finally, while the authors of the study claimed the results relating to IBS were “remarkable”, no statistically significant differences in outcomes between the groups was shown in the study paper. A final randomised control trial had 82 participants who were split into two groups and looked at weight loss. One half were given an elimination diet based on the result of the IgG intolerance test. The other half (the control group) underwent a weight loss program overseen by a dietician. While the study showed statistically significant differences, favouring the elimination diet group, for weight, BMI and waist to hip ratios, it was unclear how randomisation had been achieved, whether blinding had occurred or whether the two groups were treated equally. Further to that, baseline characteristics between the two groups appeared to show that the control group was heavier. The study therefore was at a high risk of bias. Having reviewed the studies to support the claims that IgG testing, in conjunction with an elimination diet, could assist with reducing and eliminating food related energy dips and unwanted weight, we considered that the evidence was not sufficient.Concerning IBS, and associated symptoms, two of the relevant studies were overall of an inappropriate design to support the claims. However, two of the other studies provided partial support for claims that an IgG-guided elimination diet might be able to identify specific food intolerances in people with that particular health condition and reduce symptoms. That evidence though came from studies that still contained concerns about the trial’s designs. Therefore, further research was needed to build on those studies, and they were not, of themselves, sufficient evidence to support advertising claims about the treatment of the named symptoms they referred to. We next assessed the survey that Supply Life had carried out. We understood that Supply Life’s statistician’s opinion was that while the survey design did suffer from some issues, which increased the chances of the results not being strong enough for reliable conclusions, overall the issues were not enough to undermine the strength of the survey and it was adequate for its purpose. We further noted the statistician believed the data from the survey indicated, that the ad had been supported by the responses to the survey. The sole exception to this was, that the survey showed the benefits of Supply Life’s service were seen after at least six weeks of adherence and therefore they believed the claim “within just days of making dietary changes” in the ad was therefore not justified. We acknowledged Supply Life’s expert opinion that the survey data also supported the suggestion that the majority of respondents following the Supply Life process perceived a benefit in terms of symptom management, but that the survey data alone could not fully substantiate the claims. They said it should be considered alongside and in the context of the scientific research submitted by Supply Life. Specifically, regarding the claim “within just days”, the expert concluded that none of the scientific research nor the survey supported this claim. Concerning “food related energy dips” they concluded the survey was consistent with one of the studies, but as that particular study did not have a strong scientific basis, the claim could not be supported. For the remainder of the claim “Make the change your body needs. If you’re suffering from…Unwanted-weight, Bloating, Diarrhoea, Constipation, IBS, our process has helped improve so many lives. Our simple process will help you to notice a difference ...” they stated that the studies and the survey meant there was enough evidence to support the claims for weight, IBS and associated symptoms. Therefore, we understood that Supply Life’s expert’s opinion was that in isolation neither the studies nor survey could fully substantiate the claims in the ad, but that when considered together, except for the claims “within just days” and “food related energy dips”, the combined evidence did support the remaining claims in the ad. We considered, however, that even a well-constructed survey of users of the service, was not a substitute for randomised controlled trials on humans. Therefore, whilst we recognised the indicative results of the survey, because it was not a primary research study, it did not provide sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim, even when taken together with the other studies. Considering the evidence in its entirety, we were unable to accept that the claims had been adequately supported and concluded that the ad was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleadingness), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health related products and beauty products).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Supplylife Group Ltd t/a Supply Life not to state or imply that an elimination diet informed by their testing could help or alleviate food related energy dips, unwanted weight, IBS or its symptoms.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/supplylife-group-ltd-a22-1174841-supplylife-group-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Connect UK Sales Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on land and property investments. In two of the cases, the ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad and a website for Connect UK Land Auctions, seen on 13 August 2024: (a) The Facebook ad stated, “Calling all Property & Land Investors. Get Exclusive Land Auction Investment Opportunities with 10-30% ROI […] Join Our Investor Mailing List Exclusive land auction investment opportunities sent directly to your inbox!” (b) The website landing page, www.connectuklandauctions.co.uk, included the claim “When selling land at auction you can actually achieve more than you would with a local estate agent.”",1. The ASA challenged whether ad (a) was misleading because it failed to illustrate the risk of the investment. The ASA further challenged whether the following claims were misleading and could be substantiated: 2. “10-30% ROI” in ad (a); and3. the claims in ad (b) that higher prices could be achieved by selling land at auction rather than by using an estate agent.,"1. Connect UK Sales Ltd (Connect UK) said they had been unaware of the need to insert a disclaimer that illustrated the risk of the investment. They said they had suspended their investment advertising pending the outcome of the investigation. 2. Connect UK said ad (a) was addressed to people who already owned or were ready to purchase a parcel of land. Prospective purchasers joined a mailing list which would alert them when large parcels of land became available. Once purchased, the parcel would be divided into smaller plots, with the help of solicitors and the Land Registry. Connect UK would then market the smaller plots individually at a 20 to 30% higher price than the subdivided value of the original purchase. They said buyers would pay more for a smaller parcel of land because it was more affordable than a larger one. They pointed out that the strategy therefore worked only for large plots of land, and that they explained this fully to prospective purchasers. They provided two case studies along with the contact details of previous sellers and current buyers for the land featured in those examples. 3. Connect UK referred to the case studies they had provided.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications should make clear that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up. Ad (a) stated, “Exclusive Land Auction Investment Opportunities with 10-30% ROI”. It therefore promoted the buying and selling of land at auction as an investment opportunity. The rate of return on investment was stated in definitive terms and the ad contained no text warning that the value of investments was variable and could go down as well as up. Because the ad did not make clear that the value of investments was variable and could go down as well as up, we concluded that it was misleading and breached the Code. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification) and 14.4 (Financial products). The CAP Code stated that before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers were likely to regard as objective and that were capable of objective substantiation.Ad (a) stated, “10-30% ROI” and did not feature any qualifying information. We considered that consumers would understand from the ad that they would achieve the stated level of return on their investment. We also considered that they would expect Connect UK to hold robust evidence to support that objective claim.We acknowledged Connect UK’s point that their strategy was based on the subdivision of large parcels of land. The case studies they provided detailed the subdivision of two large plots of land in September 2021 and May 2024. The first plot, valued by a local estate agent at £25,000 and sold to a purchaser on Connect UK’s mailing list for £48,500, was split into two lots which together sold for £138,500. That represented a 185.6% increase in final value. The second plot, valued by a local estate agent at £950,000, was subdivided into 20 lots which together sold for £1,242,000. That represented a 30% increase in final value. However, because the case studies related to only two examples, one of which was several years previously, we had not seen sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim that a return on investment of 10–30% was generally achievable for investors using Connect UK’s services. We concluded that the claim was likely to mislead. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). Ad (b) stated, “Did you know that when you sell your land at auction you can achieve a much higher price than you would with a local estate agent?” We considered that consumers would understand from the claim that land sold by auction would be likely to sell for a considerably higher sum than if that land were sold by an estate agent. Connect UK commented in their case studies that the auction process typically involved a shorter selling timeframe and was less likely to be subject to lengthy negotiations or the sale falling through. While the case studies provided examples of an estate agent valuation that was considerably lower than the final sale price, we had not seen evidence to show that the increase could be attributed to the method of sale. The quoted figures for estate agents were for valuations rather than sold prices, and we had not seen evidence that selling prices achieved by estate agents for equivalent plots of land were generally lower than those sold at auction. We considered that we had not seen sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim and concluded that it was misleading. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Connect UK Sales Ltd to ensure that future ads made sufficiently clear that the value of investments was variable and could go down as well as up. We also told them to ensure they held documentary evidence to substantiate both their investment claims and their claims comparing prices achieved at auction and by estate agents.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/connect-uk-sales-ltd-a24-1256131-connect-uk-sales-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Family Vision Ltd,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Family Vision, a “rent-to-own” credit broker, seen in December 2024. The ad featured a carousel of images in the style of an advent calendar displaying products including games consoles and a TV. Underneath each image was a clickable button labelled “Shop Now” beside text that read “Shop Christmas gifts!” and “Christmas Shopping for all”. The accompanying text stated “Christmas shopping just got more affordable…shop the gifts you want with monthly financing through Family Vision. Ask our experts about financing options for the products you’ve been wanting, from iPads to new home furniture and much more!”","The ASA challenged whether the ad was socially irresponsible, because it encouraged consumers to spend more than they could afford by taking out credit agreements to fund Christmas spending.","Family Vision Ltd said they had removed the ad on receiving notification of the ASA’s investigation. They said they were regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and offered legitimate credit lines to customers who might otherwise not be able to afford key events such as Christmas. Family Vision explained they carried out thorough affordability checks to ensure that customers would be able to repay the loan alongside their priority living expenses. They stated that they had a large number of repeat customers, which they believed demonstrated that they were a trusted company. They highlighted that they had a number of steps to ensure customers did not take out loans they could not afford, including creditworthiness assessments, risk reviews and verbally explaining pre-contractual information to each potential consumer to give them the opportunity to ask questions. They said they regularly asked customers to notify them if their circumstances changed or they became financially vulnerable. They cited customer satisfaction surveys which they believed showed they did not intentionally encourage irresponsible borrowing. Family Vision acknowledged that the ad encouraged customers to obtain finance. However, they did not believe the ad was irresponsible due to the processes they implemented to protect against unaffordable lending. They explained that they would rather customers obtained credit from a company that would offer support if their circumstances changed than illegal lenders who would have a detrimental impact on the financially vulnerable. They said they had recruited a marketing specialist who would manage most of their ads internally moving forward and would give consideration to the ASA’s comments.","The ASA acknowledged that Christmas was an expensive time period when people might struggle to cover additional costs such as buying gifts to celebrate Christmas Day. We also acknowledged that Family Vision had processes in place to check the affordability of their credit agreements for each customer and asked customers to inform them if they were experiencing financial difficulties. However, as with any credit provider, customers would be required to repay what they had borrowed, with interest, and there would be consequences if repayments were not made on time. We therefore focused our assessment on whether the ad presented Family Vision’s financial products responsibly. The ad featured the claims “Christmas shopping just got more affordable… shop the gifts you want” and “Christmas shopping for all”. The ad also referred to purchasing iPads and included images of games consoles and a TV. The implication was that by using Family Vision’s credit products, consumers could purchase the products featured in the ad. In that context, the ad irresponsibly suggested people should use credit to purchase expensive, non-essential items as Christmas gifts. That was compounded by the claims “Christmas shopping for all” and “more affordable”, which would be understood as meaning that it would be beneficial for everyone, regardless of financial circumstances, to enter into credit agreements for non-essential and costly items. We concluded that the combination of claims and images encouraged consumers to use credit agreements to overspend at Christmas. We acknowledged that Family Vision said the ad had been withdrawn. However, for the reasons stated, we concluded that the ad encouraged the use of credit agreements to fund Christmas spending in a way that was irresponsible and, therefore, breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Family Vision Ltd to ensure that future ads did not irresponsibly encourage excessive spending through the use of credit, particularly in relation to Christmas spending.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/family-vision-ltd-a24-1271798-family-vision-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on High Seat Ltd t/a HSL,,"A website, two emails and a leaflet for High Seat Ltd, a furniture retailer: a. The website, www.hslchairs.com/, seen in October 2024, was headed, “Comfort in Time for Christmas”. Text underneath stated, “Order by 13th November to guarantee delivery before the big day. T&C’s apply”. A Terms and Conditions page stated “[…] Christmas cut off dates may vary by product and are subject to change, please ask in-store for details”. b. The first email, dated 31 October 2024 stated, “Comfort in time for Christmas […] Order by 13th November *T&Cs apply”. This was followed by “Don’t miss your chance to get comfort in time for Christmas […] You have until 13th November to guarantee delivery before the big day”. The asterisk linked to small print at the bottom of the email that stated, “[…] Christmas cut-off dates may vary by product and are subject to change, please ask in-store for details”. c. The second email, dated 3 November 2024, featured text at the top stating, “Just 10 days left to get guaranteed Christmas delivery”. It contained the same text as ad (b) regarding delivery. d. The leaflet, seen in October 2024, featured text stating, “Comfort in time for Christmas […] Save up to 25%* Ends 13th November Order now for guaranteed Christmas delivery […] Order before November 13th for free delivery and assembly in time for Christmas”. The asterisk linked to small print at the bottom of the leaflet which stated “[…] Christmas cut-off dates may vary by product and are subject to change, please ask in-store for details”.",,"High Seat Ltd said that their T&Cs were consistent and present in all ads, across all media. The T&Cs stated that the cut-off dates for delivery before Christmas varied by product and were subject to change. Customers were invited to ask in store for details, thereby establishing if the product they wanted was available in time for Christmas. Stores were regularly updated on products and fabrics no longer available for Christmas delivery, including via a weekly bulletin to all retail staff, as customers could only purchase items via a store. High Seat said that was largely because fabric availability changed in light of demand. High Seat said that the ad campaign had finished on 13 November 2024 but that they would ensure that their marketing team was made aware of the complaint and would continue to make T&Cs clear in their advertising.","The CAP Code required that all marketing communications must state significant limitations and qualifications. The Code also required qualifications to be presented clearly. The ASA considered that the claims in the ads “Comfort in Time for Christmas”, “Order by 13th November to guarantee delivery before the big day”, “Don’t miss your chance to get comfort in time for Christmas”, “Just 10 days left to get guaranteed Christmas delivery” and “Order before November 13th for free delivery and assembly in time for Christmas” would be interpreted by consumers to mean if they ordered before 13 November, they were guaranteed delivery of their item before Christmas. We considered that those claims were prominent and the primary focus of the ads. We further considered that the availability of certain products and fabrics for delivery in time for Christmas was likely to be a significant factor in deciding whether and when to make a purchase. The fact that certain products were excluded from the guaranteed delivery by Christmas offer was significant information which would affect consumers’ understanding of the claims. We acknowledged that the ads included qualifying text regarding delivery times which explained that Christmas cut-off dates varied by product, were subject to change and that consumers should check in-store. The ads included, alongside the Christmas delivery claims, text stating “T&Cs apply”. Ad (a), the website, did not include an asterisk next to “T&Cs” and therefore consumers were required to search for that information on the website. It was located on another webpage headed “Sale”. Ads (b), (c) and (d) did contain asterisks next to “T&Cs” which linked to the small print at the bottom of the emails and leaflet respectively. Consumers were therefore required to scroll down to the bottom of the emails and to the bottom of page 4 of the leaflet to find that information. We considered that the qualifying information was not sufficiently prominent in ads (a)–(d) for consumers to be able to understand that not all items qualified for guaranteed delivery before Christmas. We therefore concluded that the claims of guaranteed delivery before Christmas in the ads were misleading. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 and 3.10 (Qualification).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told High Seat Ltd to ensure that their future marketing communications included all significant limitations and qualifications clearly and in a prominent place.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/high-seat-ltd-a24-1267477-high-seat-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on INSTITUTO NATURVITA S.L. t/a Natur Vital,,"A page on Natur Vital’s website, www.naturvital.co.uk, relating to a hair colourant range, seen on 2 July 2024, featured the heading “PPD FREE PERMANENT HAIR COLOUR”. Further text included “PPD FREE PERMANENT HAIR DYE WITH HIGH SKIN TOLERANCE […] banishes grey hairs in just 20 minutes, along with lessening the risks of allergic reactions and skin irritations. […] NaturVital Coloursafe is free from […] Para-phenylenediamine (PPD) for a kinder and more gentle colouring experience. PARA-PHENYLENEDIAMINE (PPD) is responsible for most allergic reactions following the use of hair dyes. […] The absence of PPD in the formula could minimize the risk of allergic reaction on the scalp. Persons with a prior PPD allergy should read instructions carefully”. That was followed by hyperlinked text “Allergic to PPD? Click here!” and “Frequently asked questions about ColourSafe Hair Colours”. Underneath, text included “Confusion occasionally arises as natural hair dye formulas often contain a number of similarly named compounds. Both PPD and Toulene-2,5 Diamine Sulfate belong to the same family of ingredients: phenylenediamines. Since these related ingredients belong to the same chemical family, it is mandated by the European Cosmetics Directive to list the official warning text ‘contains phenylenediamines’ on retail packaging. Natural Vital colour products that do not contain PPD may still list phenylenediamines in their ingredients; however, they will NOT CONTAIN PPD (‘p-phenylenediamine.’) Clicking the “Allergic to PPD? Click here!” link took consumers to a page which included the text “Should you already be allergic to para-phenylendiamine (PPD), this can trigger a range of allergies from chemical to natural ingredients. Natur Vital has removed PPD from the Coloursafe range we have replaced this chemical with Toulene 2.5 Diamine sulphate a less aggressive ingredient […], our research has shown that 50% of people with a PPD allergy react to Coloursafe, the other 50% show no reaction and can safely use Coloursafe. […] This makes Coloursafe one of the safest hair colours available”. Underlined text then stated, “People who have a prior allergy to PPD please be aware that you may react to other ingredients in the Coloursafe formula. A 48 hour patch test is essential”.","The ASA received a complaint from the Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), who understood that the products contained paratoluene diamine sulfate (toulene-2,5 diamine sulfate), which could cause allergic reactions in individuals with an allergy to para-phenylenediamine (PPD). The CTPA challenged whether the ad misleadingly and irresponsibly implied that the products were safe for individuals with an allergy to PPD.","Instituto Naturvita S.L. t/a Natur Vital stated that they were committed to resolving the issue, but did not believe that the information on their website was misleading. It stated, “Allergic to PPD?” and contained a link with information from the New Zealand Dermatological Society. Underneath that link, they recommended that a 48-hour patch test was essential for the hair colour range. They also stated on the website that toulene-2,5 diamine sulfate was an ingredient in the product, which was why they recommended the 48-hour patch test.","The ASA understood that whilst the Natur Vital hair colourants were free from para-phenylenediamine (PPD), they contained a different chemical: toulene-2,5 diamine sulfate. We understood that toulene-2,5 diamine sulfate was also called paratoluene diamine sulfate and abbreviated to PTD. The ad featured several claims that the product did not include PPD, and that PPD was linked to allergic reactions. That included “PPD FREE PERMANENT HAIR DYE WITH HIGH SKIN TOLERANCE”, “lessening the risks of allergic reactions and skin irritations” and “[PPD] is responsible for most allergic reactions […] The absence of PPD in the formula could minimize the risk of allergic reactions”. We considered the combination of the wording of the claims and the frequency of their repetition would cause consumers to understand that there was very little risk of the hair colourants causing an allergic reaction in consumers with allergies to PPD or other allergens. The product name “ColourSafe”, further reinforced this impression.We also considered that the wording under the subheading “Frequently asked questions about ColourSafe Hair Colours” was ambiguous. It referenced that, like PPD, toulene-2,5 diamine sulfate was a phenylenediamine. However, we considered it did not make clear that the products featured the on-pack warning “contains phenylenediamines” because they contained toulene-2,5 diamine sulfate. We understood from CTPA guidance that the warning was legally required because all phenylenediamines, including toulene-2,5 diamine sulfate, carried a level of risk of allergic reaction. We considered the ad’s wording therefore had the effects of downplaying the warning and further reinforcing the impression that the products were very unlikely to cause an allergic reaction. We acknowledged that, if the consumer clicked on “Allergic to PPD?”, they were taken to a page which stated that 50% of people who had an allergy to PPD would also have an allergy to toulene-2,5 diamine sulfate, along with the recommendation that a 48-hour patch test should be carried out. However, we considered that this information was not presented sufficiently clearly nor prominently to counteract the impression created by the previous webpage that there was very little risk that the products would cause an allergic reaction in people with a PPD allergy or other allergies. We further considered that, even if this information had appeared on the previous page, it would have still been insufficient to counter the overall impression of all the other claims in the ad. For these reasons, we concluded that the ad misleadingly implied that there was very little risk that the products could cause an allergic reaction in individuals with an allergy to PPD and other allergens, when that was not the case. In the context that allergies were a serious medical condition, we further concluded that that implication was irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 and 3.10 (Qualification).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Land Profits EDU Ltd t/a Land Profits,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on land and property investments. In two of the cases, the ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","Two paid-for Facebook ads and a website for Land Profits, a land development and mentorship company, seen on 20 August 2024: (a) The first paid-for Facebook ad stated, “We’ve already helped HUNDREDS make money with land in 2024! […] It’s So Simple, Just watch our FREE webinar! You Are Only ONE Land Deal Away From 6 Figure Profits! Below that was an image with superimposed text that stated, “OUR CLIENT MIKE GOT A £350K LAND DEAL WORKING WITH US Want to make a living with land? Want financial freedom? Watch our FREE Webinar”.

Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications for investments made clear that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up, and that past performance or experience did not necessarily give a guide for the future. The Code further stated that examples of past performance or experience should not be unrepresentative. We understood that Land Profits offered mentoring, training and support to investors seeking to acquire and sell land for property development. Services they provided included finding land, negotiating deals, obtaining planning permission and selling on the land for a profit. Ads (a) and (b) stated, “You Are Only ONE Land Deal Away From 6 Figure Profits” and ad (c) stated, “Discover How to Make Six Figures with Land Investments – Even if You’ve Never Done It Before”. However, the ads contained no text stating that the value of investments was variable and could go down as well as up.Ads (a) and (b) also stated, “We’ve already helped HUNDREDS make money with land in 2024!”. We considered that consumers would understand that many of Land Profits’ clients had profited in recent months. However, the ads contained no information to explain that past performance was not a guide for the future. Ad (a) also featured the claim “OUR CLIENT MIKE GOT A £350K LAND DEAL WORKING WITH US”. Ad (b) stated, “£6,000,000 PROFIT DONE BY OUR CLIENTS THIS YEAR”. Ad (c) featured testimonial statements and videos entitled “CLIENT RESULTS.” Therefore, the ads also referred to the previous performance of individual land deals. We considered that consumers were therefore likely to understand that they could achieve similar amounts in future. The ads referred to making a living with land, financial freedom, a “life-changing property strategy planning uplift” and “securing your future”. In the context of those claims, which we considered suggested that consumers could achieve financial security for life through the investments, we considered that it was particularly important for ads to responsibly and realistically depict the profits that clients were likely to make. We noted, however, we had not seen evidence to show that the figures achieved were representative of the profits that could generally be achieved. We acknowledged that ad (c) stated that the testimonials should not be considered as ""typical results”. However, that qualifying information appeared in small text which meant it could easily be overlooked. Additionally, it appeared only on the website landing page and not in the social media ads. We considered that information was not therefore presented immediately and clearly to consumers.Because the ads did not make clear that investments could go down as well as up, or that past performance did not necessarily give a guide for the future, and because we had not seen evidence to show that the examples of past performance were representative, we concluded that they were misleading. On those points, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification), 14.4 and 14.5 (Financial products). 3.

ASA Ruling on Luxury Lodge Estates Company Ltd t/a Luxury Lodges,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on land and property investments. In two of the cases, the ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Summary of council decision: Four issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A magazine ad for Luxury Lodges, a holiday property investment company, seen in the Saturday Times magazine on 17 July 2024, was headlined “Luxury residences available across 5-star resorts in the UK Invest from £295,000”. Further text stated, “Up to £83,454 over two years guaranteed return based on historical success”. Smaller text stated, “Own a luxury coastal lodge […] Benefit from our sublet plan with guaranteed returns […]”. A QR code and text that stated, “SCAN FOR MORE INFO” were featured at the bottom of the ad.","1. The complainant challenged whether the claim “Up to £83,454 over two years guaranteed return” was misleading, because the ad stated the return was based on historical success, which was not therefore guaranteed.The ASA challenged whether the ad was misleading and breached the Code because it: 2. failed to illustrate the risks of the investment; 3. did not make clear that the advertised return related to rental income under the sublet guarantee, rather than the value of the investment; and 4. did not make clear that additional fees and charges applied.","1. Luxury Lodge Estates Company Ltd (Luxury Lodges) said the advertised return, which was based on rental income from their sublet programme, was guaranteed and legally binding. They supplied a copy of the guarantee agreement between themselves and the lodge owner. Luxury Lodges guaranteed income, based on a minimum occupancy rate of 80% for each lodge. The exact figure was determined by the market demand for, and occupancy history of, the specific lodge purchased. They explained that if the income did not reach that level by the end of a 12-month period, the company would make up the shortfall. The guaranteed figures were based on the company’s historical success but were not dependant on it being repeated. Neither the historical return nor the actual return had a bearing on the guaranteed return. If the actual return was higher than the guaranteed one, owners would receive the higher amount. 2. Luxury Lodges believed that because the advertised return was guaranteed, a risk warning was not required. 3. Luxury Lodges said the ad made no reference to any increase in the capital value of a lodge, nor to its eventual sale. Rather, it referred to a fixed sublet return over an ongoing two-year period. They believed that would not be misconstrued as referring to the potential value of the lodge if, or when, it was sold. 4. Luxury Lodges said the advertised price accurately reflected the purchase price of one of their lodges. Service charges applied only if the owner chose to holiday at the resort; the majority of owners, who rented out their lodge for the whole year, did not have to pay them. They added that when charges did apply, they were deducted before the guaranteed return was paid out.","The CAP Code required offers of financial products to be set out in a way that allowed them to be understood easily by the audience being addressed and must not take advantage of consumers’ inexperience or credulity. If the value of an investment was guaranteed, the marketing communication must explain the guarantee. The ad was headlined “Luxury residences available across 5-star resorts in the UK Invest from £295,000”. The ASA considered that those claims, which were prominent in the ad, promoted the purchase of the property as an investment. The ad went on to state, in a heading lower down the page, “Up to £83,454 over two years guaranteed return based on historical success”. Further, smaller, text lower down stated, “Benefit from our sublet plan with guaranteed returns”, referring to the optional sublet programme which provided a fixed minimum income over a maximum two-year period for those owners who chose to sign up to it. Each of those references, in particular the smallest text relating to the sublet plan was not, however, linked to the quoted return figure, which appeared separately higher up the page. As such, in the context of an ad that promoted property as an investment, and referred to “historical success”, we considered it was ambiguous whether the return figure was instead intended to refer to the value of the property, and as an indication of the returns that could be expected on the value of the property in future. In any case, we considered it was not sufficiently clear that the quoted return linked to the guarantee related to rental income from the optional sublet scheme. We noted that the phrase “based on historical success” was not intended to be seen as a guide to future returns and that it did not have any bearing on the income owners would receive over the guarantee period. Luxury Lodges had derived the guaranteed return figure for each lodge, where owners could receive up to a maximum of £83,354 over a two-year period, from their prior knowledge of factors such as market demand and occupancy levels, and that they intended “historical success” to be understood by consumers in that context. We understood that Luxury Lodges guaranteed a minimum occupancy level of 80% and would make up any shortfall in income if occupancy did not reach that level after 12 months. However, none of those details of how the guarantee worked were made clear in the ad. In addition, the guaranteed sublet programme was valid for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 24 months, whereas the ad did not make clear that the guarantee did not necessarily apply across the full two years. We considered that the ad did not make clear how the guarantee worked and did not explain its relevance to the stated return. Because the ad did not make clear the nature of the guarantee, and did not make sufficiently clear that the advertised return was linked to the sublet programme or how it worked, we concluded that it was misleading and breached the Code. On those points, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification), 14.1 and 14.4 (Financial products). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications should make clear that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up. The Code also required that marketing communications make clear that past performance or experience did not necessarily give a guide for the future; if they were used in marketing communications, examples of past performance or experience should not be unrepresentative. The ad stated, “Invest from £295,000” and “Up to £83,454 over two years guaranteed return based on historical success”. We acknowledged that the quoted figure related to rental income and that it was guaranteed for a maximum two-year period. For the reasons stated in points 1 and 3 above, we considered that the ad did not make the nature of the guarantee clear. In addition, the ad did not make clear that the value of the property investment itself was variable and could go down as well as up. We considered that the reference to historical success would be seen as giving a guide to future returns. It was not, however, qualified with a statement that past performance did not necessarily give a guide for the future. Because it did not make clear the risks of the investment, we concluded that the ad was misleading and breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification) and 14.4 and 14.5 (Financial products). The CAP Code required offers of financial products to be set out in a way that allowed them to be understood easily by the audience being addressed and must not take advantage of consumers’ inexperience or credulity. The Code also stated that quoted prices must include non-optional taxes, duties, fees and charges that applied to all or most buyers. Additionally, the Code stated that if a tax, duty, fee or charge could not be calculated in advance, for example, because it depended on the consumer's circumstances, the marketing communication must make clear that it was excluded from the advertised price and state how it was calculated.The ad stated, “Invest from £295,000” and did not refer to any additional costs. We considered that consumers would therefore expect the “from” price to include all additional fees and charges. We acknowledged Luxury Lodges' point that the annual service charge applied only to those buyers who chose to holiday at their lodge. However, the FAQ section of the website listed the service charge, utilities fee and insurance as additional costs incurred after purchase. Furthermore, the individual property listings each detailed an annual service charge and did not specify that it was applicable only to those owners who opted to stay in their lodge. Because the quoted price did not include non-optional, ongoing fees and charges that applied to all or most buyers, and because the ad did not make clear that other fees, that could not be calculated in advance, might apply, and how they would be calculated, we concluded that the ad was misleading and breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.18 and 3.19 (Prices) and 14.1 (Financial products)","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Next Retail Ltd t/a NEXT,,"A product listing for Dark Blue Power Stretch Denim Leggings on the NEXT website, seen on 19 September 2024. The ad featured a model wearing the leggings, sat on a wooden block. The model’s legs were extended closer to the camera.","The complainant, who believed the model appeared unhealthily thin, challenged whether the ad was irresponsible.","Next Retail Ltd t/a NEXT said that the ad was created with a strong sense of responsibility to both consumers and society. They aimed to represent their product in a way that was authentic and responsible, and they carefully considered all elements of the model’s presentation. They said that the creative teams at Next were mindful of including a diverse range of models and used models ranging from slim to plus size. For that particular shoot, they considered that the model selected, while slim, had a healthy and toned physique that aligned with the nature of their product. They believed that her proportions were balanced, particularly considering her height, which was 5’9”. The intention was to showcase the leggings, which were available in a broad range of sizes, including extra-long length. The model wore the smallest size of the long range.In relation to the product “Dark Blue Power Stretch Denim Leggings”, the ad investigated was one of six images advertising the product online, including one image of the product on its own. The other images within the set were focused solely on the product. However, they considered that an image of the product on its own may have suggested a more loose-fitting style, which would be misleading to consumers. They provided other images of the leggings to support this claim. They confirmed that they had not applied digital retouching to alter the model’s appearance, and that the leggings were not tailored to fit the model. However, they said that the image of the leggings was altered so that the leggings were brought further down towards the model’s ankle, on both of her legs. This was done without altering the appearance of the model’s proportions. They said that the model’s neutral expression and relaxed pose, in addition to her pose seated on a box, were chosen specifically to display the leggings’ fit on both straight and bent legs. The setup was selected to maintain focus on the product while avoiding any exaggeration of her body shape. The model’s posture was upright, relaxed, with toned arms visible – attributes that reinforced her healthy appearance. They said that they understood that due to the model’s height and long limbs, her build could potentially be perceived as slender. However, they believed that her overall presentation conveyed a healthy figure. They noted that the loose-fitting t-shirt, showed a waist size that they felt represented a healthy, proportioned build. They said that the model’s leg was positioned in a natural pose to enable her to sit upright and in a comfortable pose. The tightness of the leggings was a characteristic of the product. The other leg was entirely straight, thereby showing how the leggings fit on both a straight and a bent leg.NEXT did not believe that the positioning of the model’s feet, nor the colour or style of the shoes, accentuated her slimness. They said that the model’s feet were proportionate to her height and noted that a further two of the six images in the product listing showed the model wearing the same shoes in other poses. They said that the style of the shoe was a suggestion on how the leggings could be styled. They highlighted that Next’s Stylist & Product Image Manager met the model in person and did not have any concerns about her health.","The model was depicted in a relaxed pose, sat on a wooden block. The ASA acknowledged that the model’s face did not appear to be gaunt and her arms, while slim, did not display any protruding bones. The model’s left leg was bent at a right angle, with her thigh appearing to be the same width as her lower leg. We considered that the sharpness of the angle drew attention to the model’s knee, which was prominent underneath the tight-fitting leggings. The model’s right leg was extended out straight towards the camera. The shot appeared to have been taken from a lower angle, which we considered accentuated the length of the model’s legs. We considered that because the angle accentuated the model’s already tall physique, it further emphasised the slimness of the model’s legs. We understood that the leggings had been digitally altered to appear longer. The model’s feet, which were styled in red, pointed shoes, were positioned at the edge of the frame. We considered the colour of the shoes, which contrasted with the blue leggings and t-shirt, drew viewers’ attention to the model’s feet. The pointed shape of the shoes, as well as their positioning, further added to the impression of the model’s elongated legs, which accentuated their slimness. We assessed the other images of the same model shown within the product listing. We noted in those photos that the model’s positioning, and the angle at which the photos were taken, was different to the ad subject to investigation, and that those differences had a visible impact on the appearance of the model’s body. We considered the model did not appear unhealthily thin in those images. Because the pose, camera angle and styling in the ad investigated strongly emphasised the slimness of the model’s legs, we considered that the ad gave the impression that the model was unhealthily thin. For the above reasons, we concluded that the ad was irresponsible.The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Next Retail Ltd t/a NEXT to ensure that the images in their ads were prepared responsibly and did not portray models as being unhealthily thin.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/next-retail-ltd-a24-1261164-next-retail-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on SteadyPay Ltd,"This ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Meta ad for SteadyPay, a short-term loan provider, seen on 13 November 2024, featured a video of a woman. The woman waved a wad of £20 notes at various points during the ad including, after applying on her phone in one hand, when a wad of notes appeared in her other hand. She said “Do you want something from the Black Friday sales, but worried you can’t afford it? You need to get CashWave by SteadyPay. With CashWave, you get £300 for 90 days to repay, spread over three equal payments”. On-screen text stated, “Repay Month 1, £100, Month 2, £100, Month 3, £100”. The woman also said “Simply apply for CashWave on the SteadyPay app and after a quick soft credit check, if you’re eligible, you’ll be able to withdraw £300. Life doesn’t wait for payday. Download and apply for CashWave now”. Further on-screen text stated “APR 91.26%”. Small print seen throughout the video stated, “Credit subject to affordability and status, for over 18s only. T&C apply. No interest fees. Representative example: amount advanced £300. Interest charged: 0%. Subscription paid: £90 (£30 x3). Total amount paid: £390. APR: 91.26%”. A caption on the post stated “Black Friday is here, and so are the deals – but are you financially ready? With SteadyPay, you get a £300 interest-free boost, split into 3 easy monthly payments. Grab what you want now, pay it off with ease!”","The ASA challenged whether, by encouraging consumers to borrow money for the Black Friday sales and spend more than they could afford, the ad was irresponsible.","SteadyPay Ltd said the ad was intended to attract customers’ attention to CashWave, a £300 three-instalment loan for which the borrower paid a monthly subscription fee of £30. The ad stated that credit was subject to affordability and status. No applicant could access funds without being assessed by both SteadyPay’s credit risk engine and a credit reference agency. Before taking a loan, applicants received a fully regulated loan agreement and pre-contract information. SteadyPay believed that meant people who could not afford a loan were not offered one. SteadyPay believed their risk engine widened access to credit to the underserved, without placing borrowers into a debt cycle. Their service was intended for people who had affordability but were rejected for loans by mainstream lenders because they did not have much credit history. The monthly subscription fee was only payable whilst the borrower had an outstanding balance, up to three months. If the borrower repaid the loan in fewer than three instalments, they paid lower subscription fees. Repayments were automated at 30-day intervals through a debit-card transaction. Customers were able to request extended payment periods through SteadyPay’s app. They believed the fact that less than 5% of customers defaulted on their loans demonstrated that the service was intended for people who had affordability.SteadyPay said that they had ceased using the ad, informed the creative team about the complaint and had begun a process to review their advertising.","The ad included the statements “Do you want something from the Black Friday sales, but worried you can’t afford it?”, “Life doesn’t wait for payday. Download and apply for CashWave now” and “Black Friday is here, and so are the deals – but are you financially ready?”. The ASA considered those statements encouraged consumers to borrow money to purchase discounted products that they could not afford in the Black Friday sales. Although the ad did not suggest the type of products to purchase, we noted the Black Friday sales typically offered savings on predominantly non-essential products such as technology, beauty and clothing. We considered that the reference to Black Friday, which was known to be the final Friday in November, with “Life doesn’t wait for payday” and “are you financially ready?” encouraged consumers to rush to take out a loan so that they did not miss out on the sales. We also considered that statements such as “Simply apply for CashWave on the SteadyPay app and after a quick soft credit check, if you’re eligible, you’ll be able to withdraw £300” and “Grab what you want now, pay it off with ease!” put undue emphasis on speed and ease of access, as well as suggesting the loan would be “easy” to pay off. We considered those statements, alongside the video of the woman shown applying on the app with one hand and the money appearing in the other, trivialised the decision to take out a loan and made light of the consequences of borrowing.Because we considered the ad encouraged consumers to borrow money for the Black Friday sales to spend more than they could afford and made light of the consequences of borrowing, we concluded it was irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told SteadyPay Ltd to ensure that future ads did not irresponsibly encourage consumers to borrow money to purchase items that they could not afford, particularly in relation to the Black Friday sales.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/steadypay-ltd-a24-1268111-steadypay-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Wilton Bradley Ltd t/a Xootz,,"A TV ad and a product page on the website for Xootz, www.xootz.co.uk, a children’s electric scooter and go-kart retailer, seen on 30 October 2024: a. The TV ad featured a group of children in a large indoor area playing with scooters and go-karts. A voice-over stated, “Get ready to unleash the fun with Xootz… With powerful motors and superfast drifting… with the new electric motors and speeds of up to 10 kilometres an hour, race your friends, dodge, speed up and jump.” b. The product page for the “Elements Electric Scooter – Green” featured the text “kids will be able to dart in and out of obstacles at the local park… every journey along the pavement or around the park is super smooth”.","Wiltshire Council, who understood it was illegal to ride privately owned electric scooters in public places, challenged whether the ads were: 1. misleading; and 2. irresponsible.","1. & 2. Wilton Bradley Ltd t/a Xootz stated that the TV ad was no longer airing. They said when designing the ad, they considered the restrictions on where e-scooters could be used, and chose a private, indoor location for filming. They stated they did not plan to run the ad again and would ensure their future ads were amended to make it clear where the product could be used.Xootz stated that the claims on their website, including “dart in and out of obstacles at the local park”, were intended to be illustrative of the manoeuvrability and experience of riding the e-scooter. They acknowledged that this could imply the product could be used in public spaces. They stated they had removed the references to parks and pavements from their website and had added a disclaimer to the product description making it clear that e-scooters could only be used legally on private land.In relation to the TV ad, Clearcast stated that they were aware that there were restrictions on the use of e-scooters, but felt that the ad did not mislead or suggest e-scooters be used irresponsibly. They highlighted that the ad was set in a private warehouse-like venue and the voice-over did not refer to the outdoors. They said that, although the ad mentioned using the e-scooters for “stunts” and “racing friends”, it was conceivable that this could be done in driveways and gardens rather than public spaces. Clearcast further stated that the Xootz e-scooters were referred to as a “range of toys” and had a top speed of up to 5 miles per hour, compared to “adult” versions that were limited to 15.5 miles per hour. They believed that, because the Xootz e-scooters had less size, weight and speed, they did not pose the same danger as larger versions. They also considered that e-scooters were fairly expensive purchases that were likely to be made by adults on behalf of their children, who were more likely to be aware of the restrictions surrounding e-scooters.","The Department for Transport’s guidance (2020) on powered transporters, an umbrella term that included electric scooters, stated that electric scooters (e-scooters) could only be used on private land, to which the general public did not have access, with the permission of the landowner. Although there were currently some very limited exceptions of use in public areas that related to rental (as opposed to privately owned) e-scooters only, the ASA understood that the use of e-scooters outside of those circumstances was illegal. We also understood that the guidance did not make a distinction between e-scooters for adults or children. We considered that, despite the increasing popularity of e-scooters, consumers would not necessarily be aware of the legality of using them. In relation to ad (a), we considered that consumers would understand from the ad that there were no restrictions on how the e-scooters could be used. The ad focused on the speed and manoeuvrability of the scooters and showed them being used in a large area. Whilst we acknowledged Clearcast’s view that e-scooters could be used on driveways or in gardens, we considered that many consumers (especially those living in urban areas) would not have access to private areas in which to use the scooters and would assume they could be used in any open space. It was therefore important, to avoid misleading consumers by omitting material information – that the ad made clear that e-scooters could only be used legally on private land. In the absence of any qualifications to that effect, we concluded the ad was misleading.In relation to ad (b), we considered that the product description of the e-scooter, including the claim “every journey along the pavement or around the park is super smooth”, suggested e-scooters could be legitimately used in public spaces in the UK. As above, we understood that this was not the case, and that the use of e-scooters in the manner described in the ad was illegal. We therefore concluded the ad was misleading. Ad (a) breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 and 3.2 (Misleading advertising) and 3.10 (Qualification).Ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 3.9 (Qualification). As above, we understood that the use of e-scooters in public places, other than in limited circumstances, was illegal. We considered the impression from ad (a) was that e-scooters could be used in any large, open space and that there were no restrictions on their use. Similarly, we considered that the manner in which ad (b) described privately owned e-scooters suggested that they could be used in public spaces in the UK and that consumers would understand it was legal to use them in those ways. Because the overall impression from both ads was that it was legal to use e-scooters in places other than on private land when that was not the case, we concluded the ads were socially irresponsible. Ad (a) breached BCAP Code rule 1.2 (Social responsibility). Ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Wilton Bradley Ltd t/a Xootz to ensure future ads did not mislead and were not socially irresponsible by omitting that e-scooters could not be used legally in public places in the UK. We also told them to ensure their ads made clear that the use of e-scooters was currently permitted only on private land.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/wilton-bradley-ltd-a24-1266482-wilton-bradley-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Astrasoft Projects Ltd t/a Sofiadate.com,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for online dating service SofiaDate, seen in October 2024. The post by account “Ladies For A Night” featured an image of a woman, alongside a caption that stated, “Ukrainian Women need the protection of strong and mature men from the West. Do you want to support them?”. Beneath the image further text stated, “For Men 40+ [pointing emoji] Ukrainian Women [fire emoji]”. The ad contained a link to the SofiaDate website.","The complainant, who believed that the ad featured harmful stereotypes and objectified women, challenged whether the ad was irresponsible, harmful and offensive.",Astrasoft Projects Ltd did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.Facebook acknowledged the complaint but made no further comment.,"The ASA was concerned by Astrasoft Project LtSo d’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. The CAP Code required marketers to ensure that ads were prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, and did not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence, with particular care to be taken to avoid causing offence on grounds of various protected characteristics, including race and sex. CAP Advertising Guidance stated that ads which directly contrasted male and female stereotypical characteristics should be handled with care. CAP Advertising Guidance also stated that portrayals that objectified or sexualised people using or fetishising characteristics that could be stereotypically associated with their racial or ethnic group had the potential to further compound harm by reinforcing ‘othering’, demeaning and/ or dehumanising beliefs about particular groups. The ad featured the claim “Ukrainian Women need the protection of strong and mature men from the West”. We considered that the ad was likely to be seen in the context of the ongoing war in Ukraine, and that in that context it exploited a gender stereotype that potentially vulnerable women in a war setting needed the protection of men. The ad was posted by an account named “Ladies for a Night” and featured an image of a younger woman. The ad also referred to “Men 40+” and “mature men”. We considered that gave the impression that the ad was offering sexual services targeted at older men. We considered that the ad therefore also exploited a stereotype that Eastern European women were more open to relationships with older men from wealthy countries and were more likely to engage in sex work. As a result, we considered that the ad objectified women and exploited characteristics stereotypically associated with Eastern European women in a harmful way. On that basis we concluded that the ad featured harmful stereotypes, was irresponsible and likely to cause serious offence. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Astrasoft Projects Ltd t/a SofiaDate to ensure their future advertising did not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence, particularly on the grounds of race or sex.

ASA Ruling on Banquist Ltd t/a Winedrops,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","a. A paid-for Facebook ad for Winedrops, an online wine retailer, seen in August 2024 featured images of three bottles of wine alongside a table comparing the “Price You’re Used To” with “Our Price”. The ad stated the “Price You’re Used To” as £50, £25 and £15 respectively for Whispering Angel Rose, Veuve Clicquot and 19 Crimes. It stated Winedrops’ prices as £26, £10 and £7 respectively. b. A sponsored Instagram story for winedropsclub [sic], seen in October 2024, showed a hand holding a bottle of champagne and a wad of banknotes. Text over the image read “So cheap you’ll think it’s a scam…until the wine gets delivered”. Under the text five white stars appeared in green squares, resembling Trustpilot ratings.",,"1. Banquist Ltd t/a Winedrops acknowledged that they had made an error in the ad; in particular, the prices stated for Veuve Cliquot and Whispering Angel had been reversed by mistake. They said they would amend that error. They also explained that they used average prices from a price-comparison, e-commerce platform for wines and spirits for their own price comparisons. They described it as based on live data, and the most reputable and widely used platform for average wine prices. Winedrops stated that the average prices on the platform were: Veuve Cliquot £45 excluding tax and £57.84 including tax; Whispering Angel £18 excluding tax and £25.44 including tax; and 19 Crimes Red Blend £8 excluding tax and £13.44 including tax. They said that the price of 19 Crimes Red Blend had been overstated and that it was possible that the average price had decreased since ad (a). But they also provided an example of one online retailer that was selling it for £14.99. Winedrops provided evidence of the prices they charged at a specific point in time, but explained that they did not keep a pricing history of their products. They emphasised that they regularly offered discounts rather than keeping one price for a sustained period. 2. Winedrops clarified that the review and accompanying rating used in ad (b) was posted on their own website at winedrops.com/reviews. Winedrops said that their Trustpilot rating was also good and provided a link to their company on the review site. They said they had thousands of five-star reviews on Trustpilot and that their overall rating was 4.4. They also queried why they were not allowed to use white stars on a green background to display a rating from a customer and said that other companies were using that design when referring to customer reviews.","The ASA considered that consumers would interpret the phrase “Price You’re Used to” to be the price at which the products were generally sold across the market. We understood that the price comparison website used for the basis of the “Price You’re Used to” claims did not include any of the supermarkets or larger wine retailers. Because of that, we considered that Winedrops had not shown that the “Price You’re Used to” prices quoted in the ad were those at which the products were generally sold across the market. We also considered that the ad, which did not give the date on which the comparison was made or how the “Price You’re Used to” was determined, did not make the basis of the comparison clear. We therefore concluded that the implied savings claims in ad (a) had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), and 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.39 and 3.40 (Price comparisons). We considered that consumers were likely to interpret the rating, which was presented as five white stars in green squares, as the official Trustpilot rating for the company. We understood, however, that the review and rating in the ad had been left by an individual customer on Winedrops’ own website and was not the Trustpilot rating for the company. Winedrops was rated 4.4 on Trustpilot according to the link they provided during the investigation. However, we had not seen evidence of their rating on Trustpilot at the time ad (b) was seen by the complainant and, in any event, a rating of 4.4 was not the same as a five-star rating, as was shown in the ad. Because the rating appeared to be a five-star Trustpilot rating for the company, and we had not seen evidence that Winedrops had a rating of five stars on Trustpilot at the time the complainant had seen the ad, we concluded that ad (b) was therefore misleading. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Banquist Ltd t/a Winedrops to ensure that future price comparisons were not misleading, and that the basis of such comparisons was clear in their advertising and adequately substantiated. We also told them to avoid implying that reviews and ratings from their own website were from third-party review websites, for example, by not using the Trustpilot stars.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/banquist-ltd-g24-1266185-banquist-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on DragonPlus Game Ltd t/a Happy Hospital,,"An in-app ad for the app Happy Hospital, seen on 17 November 2024, in the app Bus Out. The ad showed several animated pregnant women in a hospital setting. Doctors attended to the women as they gave birth and, after a short time, a ghost icon of a baby and the word “FAILED” appeared above two of the women. One of the women became angry and the other began to cry. The ad ended with a button which contained the text “Can you do better?”.","The complainant, who believed the ad trivialised miscarriage, challenged whether the ad was offensive and likely to cause unnecessary distress.",DragonPlus Game Ltd did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by DragonPlus Game Ltd’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code required marketers to avoid causing serious or widespread offence and to ensure advertising was prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. They must not cause fear or distress without justifiable reason and, if it could be justified, the fear or distress should not be excessive. The animated ad depicted a hospital setting with pregnant women being attended to by doctors. After a short time, a ghost icon of a baby appeared above one of the women, who was shown to be angry, and then above a second woman, who began to cry. We considered that the ad portrayed the women experiencing miscarriage or stillbirth. The ad featured bright colours and a cartoonish animation style, including characters with large eyes and exaggerated facial expressions, which we considered gave the ad a playful and light-hearted tone. We considered that the cartoon depiction of miscarriage or stillbirth and the playful tone made miscarriage or stillbirth appear trivial. We considered that the ad, in portraying miscarriage or stillbirth in a trivial way, was irresponsible and likely to cause serious offence, particularly in the context of an ad for a mobile app game. We understood that miscarriage and stillbirth were significant events for someone to experience and could be traumatic for those involved. We considered, therefore, that its portrayal in the ad was likely to cause unjustified distress, especially in those with lived experience of miscarriage or stillbirth. In particular, the use of cartoon ghost icons and the text ""FAILED"" to depict the death of a baby was likely to cause unjustified distress and was irresponsible in making light of miscarriage and stillbirth. On that basis we considered that the ad trivialised miscarriage and stillbirth, and we therefore concluded that the ad was socially irresponsible and was likely to cause unjustified distress and serious offence. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.1 and 4.2 (Harm and offence).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told DragonPlus Game Ltd to ensure that future ads were socially responsible and did not cause unjustified distress or serious offence. We referred the matter to CAP’s compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/dragonplus-game-ltd-a24-1268671-dragonplus-game-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on ScottishPower Energy Retail Ltd t/a Scottish Power,,"A TV ad for Scottish Power, seen on Channel 4 on 18 July 2024 and 25 July 2024, featured a video of tree leaves and overlayed text which stated, “GEORGE CLARKE’S amazing GREEN spaces”. George Clarke then featured and said, “I’ve seen some amazing spaces all around the UK. From great tree houses, to log cabins, and house boats. Oh, and don’t forget about the hobbit house in Gwent, that was truly amazing.” As houses of each colour were shown, he continued, “From yellow houses, blue houses, pink houses, and … greener houses, like this one. Of course, it’s not about the colour, it’s all about the green solutions provided by Scottish Power. So why not make your amazing space even more amazing by turning it a little greener.” The first 12 seconds of the ad contained the text “#ad” in the top right corner. From 26 seconds to 35 seconds into the advert, superimposed text at the bottom stated, “Scottish Power supply products from third party manufacturers and installations are carried out by approved partners”. Superimposed text then stated, “Scottish Power products are not available in Northern Ireland”, and finally “Our domestic green tariffs are backed by 100% green electricity, made by our windfarms in the UK”. The end of the ad featured the Scottish Power logo which had the text “Scottish Power”.",Three complainants challenged whether the ad was obviously distinguishable from the “George Clarke’s Amazing Spaces” television programme.,"ScottishPower Energy Retail Ltd (Scottish Power) explained that they believed the ad was clearly recognisable as such throughout. They included the text “ad” in the top right corner for the first 12 seconds, which was shown throughout the headline text displayed at the beginning and during George Clarke’s introductory remarks. They said that the addition of the hashtag made it immediately recognisable as an ad. Furthermore, the text was in plain typeface and was in a strongly contrasting colour from the background. They further stated that there were then three separate additional sets of text, and two of them specifically mentioned Scottish Power products. There were also three verbal references to Scottish Power within George Clarke’s dialogue. The Scottish Power logo further featured on the back of the jacket of one individual, and the end frame contained the Scottish Power logo. Overall, 43 seconds out of the total 60-second ad contained a visual identifier which signalled to the viewer that it was an ad. Scottish Power said that there was a sponsorship ident for a different company, shown for five seconds on either side of the central ad break, and at the start and end of the programme. The ad followed the sponsorship content and ads for other products also followed the Scottish Power ad. Therefore, the audience would have quickly identified that it was an ad and therefore distinct from editorial content.Channel 4 reiterated points made by Scottish Power. They further stated the ad was a typical length and did not occupy the whole commercial break. The content of the ad also did not mirror the editorial themes of George Clarke’s Amazing Spaces. For instance, no properties were reviewed in the way in which they were in George Clarke’s Amazing Spaces, and the ad did not feature contributors transforming small spaces, as they did in the show. Clearcast said, the duration of the text “ad” on screen, the superimposed text outlining Scottish Power’s products and the Scottish Power branding on the individual’s uniform, and in the final frame, was sufficient to distinguish the content as an ad.","The BCAP Code stated that broadcast ads must be obviously distinguishable from editorial content, especially if they used a situation, performance or style reminiscent of editorial content, to prevent the audience being confused between the two, and the audience should quickly recognise the message as an ad. In addition, the use of a title, logo, set or music associated with a programme needed special care, and television ads must not refer to themselves in a way that might lead viewers to believe they were watching a programme. The ASA understood that the ad was aired during ad breaks around “George Clarke’s Amazing Spaces” television programme and we assessed it in that context. The ad started with the headline text “GEORGE CLARKE’S amazing GREEN spaces”, which was the same font and style as the headline text presented at the beginning of the programme. The text was also set against a background of greenery, which was the same way it was presented in his show. Furthermore, immediately after that text was shown, the ad featured George Clarke discussing “amazing spaces” he had seen in the UK, which included the imagery and description of various houses. He continued as the presenter with dialogue throughout the remainder of the ad. We acknowledged that the text “ad” featured in the top right corner for the first 12 seconds. However, we considered that was insufficient to mitigate the other elements in the ad, which were reminiscent of “George Clarke’s Amazing Spaces” television programme. The text “ad” was also relatively small in the top right-hand corner and was in the same colour and a similar font to the headline text presented in the middle of the screen. We considered that this meant it was likely to be overlooked. As such, we considered viewers were likely to believe, at least initially, that they were watching a programme. We acknowledged that Scottish Power and their products were referenced from approximately halfway through the ad. The Code stated that the audience should be able to quickly recognise the message as an ad. However, the Scottish Power references and the mention of products appeared after a significant portion of the ad had already aired. We further acknowledged that there was sponsorship content separating the ad from programme content, which related to a different company. However, the ad was in any case required to be quickly recognisable as such and be distinguished from editorial content. Given the similarity between the beginning of the ad and the television programme, we considered the audience were likely to interpret the ad as programme content. For the reasons given, we considered viewers were unlikely to quickly recognise the message as an ad distinguishable from editorial content and were instead likely to believe they were watching a programme. We therefore concluded that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 2.1, 2.3, and 2.4.1 (Recognition of advertising).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told ScottishPower Energy Retail Ltd to ensure that future ads were obviously distinguishable from editorial content, did not refer to themselves in a way that might lead viewers to believe they were watching a programme and were quickly recognisable as advertising.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/scottishpower-energy-retail-ltd-g24-1253901-scottishpower-energy-retail-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Wireless Group Media (GB) Ltd t/a Virgin Radio,,"A promotion, on Virgin Radio’s website virginradio.co.uk, seen in August 2024 for a prize draw titled “BEAT THE INTRO … AND WIN £5000”. Text stated, “Always fancied yourself as a bit of a music maestro? Then we’ve got the game for you – introducing Virgin Radio’s Beat The Intro! All you have to do to get involved is say ‘Alexa play Virgin Radio’s Beat The Intro’ and you can play along at home. Alexa will play you three songs, and your job is to name them and the artists. To be in with a chance of winning that cash you just need to have a guess at each of the three tracks – you don’t even have to get them all correct! Remember, one entry per Amazon account per day! […]” The terms and conditions stated, “[…] The promotion starts at 00:00 on 8th May 2024 and has been further extended, from previous closing dates of 8th June 2024 and 20th July 2024, to now close at 23:59 on 19th August 2024 (UK time) (the ‘Promotion Period’) […]”","Compers News Magazine challenged whether the promotion breached the Code, because the closing date had been extended twice.","Wireless Group Media (GB) Ltd t/a Virgin Radio said the “Beat the intro” promotion was created to encourage Virgin Radio listeners to link their Amazon Alexa accounts to their News Broadcasting Skill, a voice activated app on the Alexa device, which was the entry method for the promotion. Virgin Radio stated that from February 2024, listeners were able to link their Alexa devices to their New Broadcasting Skill. They said that prior to the launch of the promotion, they tested the game and had previously tested mandatory account linking for the News Broadcasting Skill via talkSPORT. They said that they tested the game across February and March 2024, and entered the secondary testing phase on 25 March 2024, which aimed to test the promotion in a real-world environment. Virgin Radio said they worked with Amazon in the lead-up to the launch of the Skill in an attempt to troubleshoot technical issues. Virgin Radio said they launched the “Beat the intro” competition on 8 May 2024, which had an original closing date of 8 June 2024. However, due to technical issues with the Alexa device that began on 2 May 2024, listeners were unable to link their accounts. Virgin Radio said they raised this issue with Amazon. The technical issue meant that only listeners who had linked their device prior to the start of the promotion were able to enter. In response, they suspended on-air and planned print media promotional activity for the promotion. They said they tested the promotion internally and conducted demonstrations on personal devices in weekly meetings and discussed the promotion in detail, before, during and after the launch. They also said that they worked on the promotion with a third party, who also conducted testing of the promotion. They said that as the issue persisted, they extended the closing date, initially to 20 July 2024, then again to the 19 August 2024. They updated the terms and conditions of the promotion each time they amended the closing date. They explained that throughout that period, the promotion continued to be playable for those who had linked their Alexa prior to May 2024, until mid-July, when Amazon resolved the technical issue. The promotion then became available to all, providing they linked their Alexa and News Broadcasting Skill. The promotion ended as expected with no further issues on 19 August 2024. The winner was chosen from all entries to the prize draw. They stated that Amazon experienced technical issues at the time of the promotion’s launch, and those issues were unpredictable and beyond their control. They believed it was necessary to extend the closing date and that their extensions sought to avoid unfairness to potential participants who were unable to participate under the original terms, as only a small percentage of Virgin Radio UK listeners had linked their Alexa accounts at the time of the promotion’s launch. They believed that the extension did not disadvantage those who were able to participate from the outset, as their entries during the entire promotional period were entered into the prize draw. They further highlighted that those participants could have accrued more entries to the prize draw than the participants who could only participate later when the technical issue was fixed, as the entry rules meant each participant was entitled to one per day. They further stated that their published rules for the promotion reserved their right to make updates or amendments in certain circumstances, which included reasons beyond their control, such as the unavailability of an entry platform before the closing date. Their rules also said that the promoter reserved the right to cancel, modify or supersede the promotion, at any time, in its sole discretion. They said that the promotion was created to encourage Virgin Radio listeners to link their accounts via the Alexa and they had issued step by step instructions for how to do that to assist listeners. They had relied on Alexa for its mechanics and no alternative method of entry was possible. They stated the prize draw was run purely for promotional purposes, intended to help make Virgin Radio UK a ‘preferred’ station for those who took part, and that no entry fee or purchase was required to enter. Amazon said that to their knowledge, the issue linking the Skills was isolated to Virgin Radio and began on 4 March 2024. There had also been another account linking issue that affected a range of Skills, which began on 23 April 2024. They also said they were not involved in the administration or planning of the promotion.","The CAP Code stated that closing dates must not be changed unless unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the promoter made it necessary and either not to change the date would be unfair to those who sought to participate within the original terms, or those who sought to participate within the original terms would not be disadvantaged by the change. The CAP Code also stated that promoters must conduct their promotions fairly and avoid causing unnecessary disappointment. Promoters were responsible for all aspects and all stages of their promotions. The ASA understood that the technical issue which affected Alexa users from linking their accounts to the News Broadcasting Skill began on 2 May 2024, six days prior to the launch of the promotion on 8 May 2024. We also understood that there had been technical issues that impacted linking Alexa accounts with Skills generally in March and April 2024. We acknowledged that Virgin Radio said they had tested the entry route prior to the promotion’s launch, although we considered it was not clear how that testing had been carried out or when. However, we considered that as the promotion relied on a single-entry route, which was relatively novel requiring participants to link their Alexa accounts with the Skills app, and which had also recently experienced technical problems, Virgin Radio should have carried out real-world testing prior to and in the run up to the promotion’s launch, including the day of the launch. We had, however, seen no evidence of that. We considered that as the technical issue appeared to have been causing the error for six days prior to the launch of the promotion, adequate pre-launch testing would have likely identified the issue. The launch of the promotion could then have been suspended until it had been fixed. We therefore did not consider the technical issue was an unavoidable circumstance beyond Virgin Radio’s control. We considered that the multiple extensions of the closing date increased the overall pool of entrants to the prize draw and therefore reduced the odds of winning for those who had pre-linked their Alexa accounts with the News Broadcasting Skill and who sought to participate within the original terms. Whilst we acknowledged that those participants could have amassed more entries than the participants entering the promotion after the technical issue was fixed, we considered that nevertheless by extending the promotion and increasing the overall pool of entrants, their odds of winning were reduced and that they were therefore disadvantaged by the extensions of the closing date. We also considered that by the time the promotion’s entry route was working for new users on 19 July 2024, those participants were entering a draw in which a proportion of participants had already had the opportunity to gain multiple entries. That group of participants, i.e. those who sought to participate within the original terms, but couldn’t until the technical problem was resolved, also had a diminished chance of winning, and we considered they were also disadvantaged. We considered that the published promotion rules did not release the advertiser from complying with the requirements of the Code in relation to the extension of closing dates. Because we considered the promotion’s closing date was changed due to factors that were not unavoidable circumstances beyond the control of the promoter, and because the change of closing date disadvantaged those who sought to participate within the original terms and therefore caused unnecessary disappointment, we concluded that the promotion had not been administered fairly and breached the Code. The promotion breached CAP Code rules (Edition 12) rules 8.1, 8.2 (Promotional marketing), 8.14 (Administration) and 8.17.4.E (Significant conditions for promotions).","The promotion must not be run again in the form complained of. We told Wireless Group Media (GB) Ltd t/a Virgin Radio to ensure that they administered their future promotions fairly; avoided unnecessary disappointment and did not change closing dates unless unavoidable circumstances beyond their control made it necessary and either not to change the date would be unfair to those who sought to participate within the original terms, or those who sought to participate within the original terms would not be disadvantaged by the change.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/wireless-group-media--gb--ltd-a24-1257127-wireless-group-media--gb--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Visual Stress Consultancy Ltd,,"A website for Visual Stress Consultancy Ltd, www.visualstress.net, seen on 24 July 2024 stated, “The right coloured tints can also help adults with blinding headlights when driving at night*”. The claim was linked to qualifying text just beneath it that said, “*We always recommend that you check the DVLA advice specifically regarding the use of tinted glasses whilst driving to ensure that you comply with the Highway Code”.","The complainant, who believed that wearing tinted glasses while driving at night was a breach of the Highway Code, challenged whether the claim was irresponsible.","Visual Stress Consultancy Ltd (Visual Stress) explained that they worked directly with clients, using the Eqilens method of assessment, to assess the correct tint for their visual stress symptoms. They said that they only provided the assessment for the lenses. All manufacturing of the lenses was outsourced to a third party. They confirmed the filters they used in their tinted glasses were categorised according to guidelines from The Federation of Manufacturing Opticians. They said that the classification and limitations of the filters could be accessed online on a major breakdown company’s website. That information showed that filters could be categorised from 0 through to 4, category 0 transmitted eighty to one hundred per cent of light and category 4 transmitted 3 to 8 per cent of light. They explained that they provided in total seventy-three filters and individually they were categories 0, 1 and 2 only. They said categories 0 to 2 were suitable for driving and only non-yellow category 0 filters could be worn driving at night. They explained while they did not provide individual category 3 or 4 filters, in the rare event that a combination of lenses reduced light transmission to below eighteen per cent (and therefore fell into category 3 or 4) their client would be informed that they could not be used for driving at night or at all. They confirmed the manufacturer of the lenses used a transmission meter to determine the category of the filter, and that all their tinted lenses would be sent to their clients with information that clearly stated their driving suitability. They said that some alternative-coloured lens treatment methods could affect colour sense. To prevent that with their lenses they were looking to integrate a colour-recognition test for traffic signal green, red and amber, as an extra layer of confidence in the suitability of their lenses for driving. They said in a further response that they had removed the mention of driving at night in tinted lenses from the website and future ads would not state or imply that their lenses could be used for driving at night.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so. In addition, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. The ASA may regard claims as misleading in the absence of adequate substantiation. Further to that marketing communications must not condone or encourage unsafe or irresponsible driving. The ad stated, “The right coloured tints can also help adults with blinding headlights when driving at night”. Consumers would therefore likely understand the claim to mean the tinted lenses provided by Visual Stress could legally be worn at night for driving. We noted the qualifying text beneath the claim stated that consumers should check with the DVLA to ensure that the lenses complied with the Highway Code. We considered that consumers would understand from the qualification that there could be specific instances or unique occasions when the lenses could not be worn for driving and that they should seek advice from the DVLA. However, that explanation did not counteract the impression that lenses provided by Visual Stress were generally legally permissible to wear for nighttime driving. Section 94 of the Highway Code stated, “At night or in poor visibility, do not use tinted glasses, lenses or visors if they restrict your vision.” We understood that sunglasses in the UK had to comply with specific standards to be sold legally, specifically the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) guidance 12312-1:2013. Those standards divided filters or lenses into 5 categories, 0 to 4 . We understood that category 4 lenses were illegal for driving, categories 1, 2 and 3 were legal to drive in the day but not at night and only category 0 lenses could be used to drive at night. Sunglasses sold in the UK had to list the relevant category on the product itself. Visual Stress had explained that the manufacturer of their lenses had a transmission meter that was able to assess and categorise the lenses provided. That meant they were able to ascertain the correct category of the lenses and would be able to inform the consumer whether or not their lenses could legally be used for nighttime driving. We sought advice from the College of Optometrists as to whether the specific transmission meter used by the manufacturer could grade their lenses to legally comply with ISO 12312-1:2013. The College of Optometrists' website stated for filters to be suitable for road use and driving they should be of categories 0, 1, 2 or 3. However, in addition it said that the “spectral transmittance” and “relative visual attenuation coefficient Q” of filters suitable for the road should meet specific criteria. Therefore, for lenses to be legally compliant on the road they not only had to be categorised but also had to fulfil the conditions regarding the “spectral transmittance of filters” and the “the relative visual attenuation coefficient Q of filters”. Regarding the relative visual attenuation, relating to driving, that referred to how much the visibility of a signal light (such as a traffic light or road sign) decreased over distance due to the tinted lenses and how that was measured. The College of Optometrists told us that while the transmission meter used by the manufacturer could categorise the lenses, they were not aware that it could test for the “relative visual attenuation coefficient Q of filters”. Therefore, there was no way of confirming that the lenses provided by Visual Stress were legal for the road in the day or night. The lenses provided by Visual Stress could not be accurately classified and therefore it could not be confirmed that they were legally permissible for driving at night. On that basis, we concluded that the claim “The right coloured tints can also help adults with blinding headlights when driving at night” was misleading and condoned unsafe driving. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 19.2 (Motoring).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Visual Stress Consultancy Ltd to ensure that future ads did not state or imply that their lenses could be used for driving at night if they did not have the evidence to support that they were legally compliant. In addition, they should not condone unsafe driving.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/visual-stress-consultancy-ltd-a24-1253433-visual-stress-consultancy-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Health Line,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on laser eye surgery referral companies. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Two paid-for Facebook ads for Health Line published on 17 May 2024: a. The caption in the first ad stated, “Tired of Contacts? Get Permanent Freedom with LASIK”. The ad also included an image of an individual wearing glasses and rubbing their eyes, alongside text that stated, “IT’S TIME TO LET GO OF YOUR EYE GLASSES. LASIK EYE SURGERY IS THE BEST SOLUTION. No Side Effects. Smaller text at the bottom of the ad stated, “LASIKEYESURGERYUK.TOP. Glasses or Contacts? LASIK Offers a Better Way. Check now for more details”. b. The caption in the second ad stated, “Safe & Effective LASIK Eye Surgery. Free Consultation Available. (Get 50% Off)”. The ad also included an image of a laser on an eye, alongside text that stated, “Transform Your Vision With LASIK EYE SURGERY. Find The Best LASIK Surgeon Near You. 50% OFF”. Smaller text at the bottom of the ad stated, “LASIKEYESURGERYUK.TOP. Perfect Vision is Possible! Get LASIK Today !”. The link led to a website, lasikeyesurgeryuk.top, which contained a series of additional links that stated, “Turkey Laser Eye Surgery”, “Laser Eye Surgery Turkey”, “Lasik Surgery Cost Nearby”, “Lasik Eye Surgery Near Me” and “Eye Laser Treatment London”.",The ASA challenged whether:,"1. Health Line said their intent with the claim “Tired of Contacts? Get Permanent Freedom with LASIK” was to highlight that LASIK could reduce dependence on contact lenses. They recognised that the phrase “Permanent Freedom” might have misleadingly suggested results were guaranteed and lifelong for all patients, which was not always the case. Health Line acknowledged that the claim “No Side Effects” was inaccurate, because all medical procedures carried potential risks. In addition, they explained, by stating “Safe & Effective LASIK Eye Surgery” they had intended to communicate that LASIK was generally considered safe and effective, but acknowledged the need to avoid implying it was suitable for everyone without exception. Health Line also accepted that the claim “Perfect Vision is Possible” might mislead, because outcomes varied among individuals. They said they understood that claims in the ads might have exaggerated the benefits and overlooked the risks associated with laser eye surgery, and that they would remove or modify claims that suggested guaranteed outcomes or a lack of risk. They also said they would in future provide balanced information that accurately reflected both the potential benefits and limitations of laser eye surgery. 2. Health Line said they did not offer laser eye surgery directly, and nor did they provide medical consultations or the ability to book appointments through their website. They connected consumers with third-party providers who offered laser eye surgery services. They acknowledged that a number of the claims in ad (a) could be interpreted as suggesting they offered those services directly, and said they would clearly state in future ads that they connected consumers with third parties. They would also ensure that any promotional claims were accurately attributed to the respective providers and were presented in a way that did not imply Health Line offered surgery directly. They said they would apply CAP’s guidance on lead generation marketing to their future advertising.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead consumers by exaggerating the capability or performance of a product. CAP guidance on ads for laser eye surgery stated that marketers should not state or imply that the procedure was permanent, suitable for all patients or all types of eye problems, that it was always successful or that the patient would never need glasses or contact lenses. It also advised marketers against making claims that laser eye surgery was completely safe, or free from side effects. Both ads included claims about the permeance and efficacy of laser eye surgery. Ad (a) featured the claim “Tired of contacts? Get Permanent Freedom with LASIK”, while ad (b) stated “Perfect Vision is Possible!” From those claims, we considered consumers would understand that the advertised LASIK eye surgery would offer a permanent outcome, meaning they would never need to wear contact lenses again, and that they would likely attain perfect, or nearly perfect vision, after the treatment. The ads also made claims about the lack of side effects associated with laser eye surgery. Ad (a) stated “No Side Effects”, and ad (b) included the claim “Safe & Effective LASIK Eye Surgery”, which we considered consumers would understand to mean that they would experience little to no side effects as a result of the procedure. We further considered that the overall tone and presentation of the ads, and the claims seen in them, would likely give consumers the impression that laser eye surgery was effective for all patients. We therefore expected that Health Line would be able to demonstrate that their advertised treatment would offer a permanent outcome, meaning that those who underwent the procedure would never need to wear contact lens or glasses again, that they would experience no side effects from the procedure, that it would result in perfect vision, and that it was suitable for all patients. However, we did not receive any evidence to substantiate the claims made in the ad. While we acknowledged Health Line’s response to the complaint, and welcomed their willingness to make changes to their advertising, we concluded that the claims “Get Permanent Freedom with LASIK”, “No Side Effects”, “Safe & Effective” and “Perfect Vision is Possible” were misleading, and had exaggerated the capability of LASIK eye surgery. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.11 (Exaggeration). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not falsely claim or imply that the marketer was acting for purposes outside its trade, business, craft or profession. It further stated that marketing communications must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. Text in ad (b) stated “Free Consultation Available”, “(Get 50% Off)”, “50% off” and “Get LASIK Today!” We considered consumers therefore would expect that the ad linked directly to a page where could access further information on offers and prices on LASIK surgery from specific clinics. We further considered that the reference to a free consultation reinforced the impression that Health Line offered laser eye surgery, and consumers would understand that, by clicking on the link, Health Line would assess their eligibility for any such surgery. However, when clicked on, the ad took consumers to a landing page that featured a number of subheadings, including “Eye Surgery to Correct Vision Cost”, “Lasik Plus Surgery Cost”, Lasik Around Me” and “Optical Examination”. Instead, we understood that the landing page for the ad was a ‘parked domain’ website set up by Better Health and Wellness. We understood that domain parking was the registration of an internet domain name without that domain being associated with services such as email or a website. Domain parking could be done for various reasons, including reserving the domain name for future development or to protect the domain name from use by others. Domain parking could also be monetised by operating a single-page website which hosted ads, as was the case here. Ads which linked through to the parked domain website would then generate income from the host of the parked domain through the impressions it collected. The ad therefore misleadingly implied that when clicked on, it would direct consumers to information on consultations, offers and prices on LASIK surgery from specific clinics, when that was not the case. We considered the nature of the content the ad linked through to would likely have a significant impact on whether or not consumers chose to engage with them. We therefore considered the nature of the content that the ad linked through to should have been made clear. Furthermore, the ad did not make clear that the link it contained took consumers to a parked domain website, and instead implied that Health Line provided information on consultations, offers and prices on LASIK surgery. Because the ad did not make clear the nature of the content linked through to, and because it implied that Health Line were acting for purposes outside their business, we concluded that it was misleading and breached the Code. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 2.3 (Recognition of Marketing Communications).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Health Line to ensure that future marketing materials did not misleadingly exaggerate the capability of LASIK treatment. We also told them to ensure that future marketing materials did not falsely imply they were acting for purposes outside their business, not to imply that they directly provided laser eye surgery if they did not, and to make clear that they were a referral company that received commission for their service.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/health-line-a24-1253884-health-line.html
ASA Ruling on Royalux Competitions Ltd,,"A website for Royalux Competitions, www.royaluxcompetitions.co.uk, seen on 11 August 2024, included a prize draw for a £5,000 garden makeover and a further £2,000 cash. The terms and conditions, which were not specific to the garden makeover prize draw, appeared on a separate webpage. Under the heading “Eligibility”, text stated, “The competition is only open to all residents in the United Kingdom aged 18 years or over except: (a) employees of the Promoter; (b) employees of agents or suppliers of the Promoter, who are professionally connected with the competition or its administration; or (c) members of the immediate families or households of (a) or (b) above”.","The complainant, who believed the prize had not been awarded in accordance with the terms and conditions because it was won by an immediate family member of the garden makeover supplier, challenged whether the promotion had been administered fairly.","Royalux Competitions Ltd (Royalux) said the winner of the draw was made by a randomised number generator live on Facebook and they provided a screenshot showing the winning number and the identity of the person with that number. The winner was the brother of the garden makeover supplier. They said Royalux employees and their immediate families were not permitted to enter draws but that that prohibition did not extend to third-party suppliers such as the garden makeover supplier. Their terms and conditions stated that they reserved the right to amend their terms and conditions as and when required and that their decision was final and no correspondence or discussion would be entered into. They acknowledged that their terms and conditions had changed several times but, because they reserved the right to do so, they believed it was within their discretion who they allowed or considered eligible to participate and win. They believed the draw had been administered fairly, in line with their terms and conditions, and confirmed that they had not received any complaints directly. They pointed out that the garden makeover was only part of the prize, the other aspect being £2,000 in cash. They had already purchased the £5,000 garden makeover from the third-party supplier before the promotion and Royalux therefore owned that prize.","The CAP Code stated that promoters must conduct their promotions equitably, promptly and efficiently; be seen to deal fairly and honourably with participants and potential participants and avoid causing unnecessary disappointment. It also stated that promoters should not give consumers justifiable grounds for complaint. The ASA understood that the original terms and conditions of the promotion stated that, in addition to employees of Royalux, employees of agents or suppliers of the Promoter who were professionally connected with the competition or its administration and members of their immediate families and households were prohibited from entering the draw. We considered that exclusion would prevent a brother of the provider of the prize from taking part. We further understood that, after the promotion ended and a winner was selected (who was the brother of the prize provider), Royalux retrospectively changed the terms and conditions of the promotion such that the exclusion of immediate family members of the prize provider was removed, therefore allowing him to retain the prize. Although Royalux maintained that their terms and conditions gave them the right to change the terms and conditions of the promotion as and when needed, we considered that retrospectively removing an exclusion to allow someone to win who would have otherwise been excluded from taking part under the original terms was not a fair or honourable way to treat participants. Further, it was likely to result in disappointment and gave consumers justifiable grounds for complaint. We therefore concluded that the promotion had not been administered fairly and breached the Code. The promotion breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.2 (Promotional marketing) and 8.14 (Administration).","The promotion must not be run again in the form complained of. We told Royalux Competitions Ltd not to administer their promotions unfairly, cause unnecessary disappointment or give consumers grounds for complaint in future – for example, by retrospectively amending terms and conditions to remove exclusions on who could participate.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/royalux-competitions-ltd-a24-1255202-royalux-competitions-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on The Essence Vault Ltd,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for The Essence Vault, a fragrance retailer, seen on 26 October 2024. The ad included a video which began by showing two perfume bottles. The first was a generic, full-size perfume bottle accompanied by the text “OVER £100”. The second, a full-size bottle of The Essence Vault product “Inspired By Lost Cherry - 444”, was accompanied by the text “ONLY £4.95”. A voice-over and corresponding text in the video stated, “STOP letting designer perfume brands rob you! Meet The Essence Vault luxury fragrances inspired by designer brands but without the crazy price tag [...] Never overpay for luxury scents again.” Text in the caption stated, “Looking for long lasting perfumes but tired of breaking the bank account? Today you’re in luck! Switch to The Essence Vault for designer inspired scents, that last for longer and don’t break your bank account”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad misleadingly implied that the full-size product was available to purchase for £4.95.,The Essence Vault stated that the ad was a variation of a previous ad which had made clear that the price was “from” £4.95. They said they had removed the ad and taken steps to ensure the problem would not reoccur.,"The ad showed a hand holding a full-size bottle of The Essence Vault perfume, above which was the claim “ONLY £4.95”. The ASA considered that consumers would interpret the price claim to relate to the product shown in the ad, which we understood was a 100 ml bottle. However, we understood that was not the case and that The Essence Vault offered three different sizes of perfume: a 5 ml sample; a 30 ml bottle; and a 100 ml bottle. We understood that the price £4.95 referred to the price of a 5 ml sample of the product, and that the price of the 100 ml bottle shown in the ad was £26.95. Given that the price claim did not relate to the product featured in the ad, we therefore considered the price claim was misleading. We acknowledged that The Essence Vault had removed the ad and had intended to advertise the product as being priced “from £4.95”. We considered that consumers were likely to understand from the ad that, what was being promoted was a full-size version of the product. Therefore, in the absence of prominent information to make clear to consumers that what was being promoted was a sample of a product rather than a full-size product, using a “from” price which related to the sample would still have been likely to mislead. Given the above, we concluded that the pricing claim in the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 3.17 (Prices).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told The Essence Vault to ensure that future pricing claims did not mislead and that their advertising clearly stated whether the price related to the sample of the product.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/the-essence-vault-ltd-a24-1266056-the-essence-vault-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Zimran Ltd t/a Prosperi Academy,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A paid-for YouTube ad for Prosperi Academy, an app offering financial investment training courses, seen on 25 October 2024. The ad featured an individual who said, “How do you become the first millionaire in your family?”. Text that stated “START WITH $20” then appeared on-screen, alongside a screen-recording of an individual’s bank account which showed the balance increasing in real time as transactions occurred. Well-known logos, each accompanied by a button labelled “INVEST”, were then shown. Next, a different individual who was described as a student was shown, accompanied by the text “Invested: $20 Income: $974”. A graph on-screen showed financial transactions quickly increasing in value, as the individual who was visibly excited, said, “Oh my god, what”. The ad then showed another screen-recording of a bank account, in which the account balance increased again as transactions occurred. Smaller text at the bottom of the screen stated, “Prosperi, as a learning platform, does not provide any investment or financial advice. Your capital may be at risk.”",The complainant challenged whether:,,"The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the claim “How do you become the first millionaire in your family?” and the screen-recording of a bank account balance rapidly increasing, that by taking Prosperi Academy’s financial investment courses, they could make high investment returns. We expected Prosperi Academy to hold robust evidence, such as data showing the investment returns made by users of the app, to substantiate those claims. We acknowledged that the claims were intended to be inspirational and illustrative; they were not based on real data. However, we considered that it was not made sufficiently clear in the ad that the investment return claims were fictional and because of that, consumers were likely to interpret them as real results. In any case, even if it had been clear that the specific return claims were fictional, the overall impression of the ad was, nevertheless, that consumers would be able to make high investment returns by taking the advertiser’s courses. Because we had not seen any evidence to demonstrate that, we concluded that the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). The CAP Code required that marketing communications made clear that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up. The ASA considered that consumers would interpret the claim “Invested: $20 Income: $974”, and the animations showing financial transactions rapidly increasing in value, to mean that large sums of money could be made quickly through financial investment. We considered that the ad was seen on a non-specific platform and addressed to a general audience who were unlikely to have any specialist knowledge of financial investment. We acknowledged the ad contained on-screen text that stated, “Your capital may be at risk”. However, this text was in a small font placed at the bottom of the ad. The text was also partially obscured by a sponsored pop-up with a link to visit the Prosperi Academy website. That statement was therefore likely to be overlooked. Furthermore, we considered that the ad did not make explicitly clear that the value of financial investments could go down or explain how consumers’ capital might be at risk. The ad included several transactions that resulted in a profit, but did not include any transactions where a loss was made. The impression from the ad was that consumers could expect to make large sums of money rapidly, with minimal risk after investing. We therefore concluded that the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 14.4 (Financial products). The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the claims “How do you become the first millionaire in your family?” and “START WITH $20” that financial investment could be undertaken by those with limited resources and knowledge of the sector. We acknowledged that the “first millionaire” claim was intended to be motivational rather than a guarantee of results. The ad did not state that “START WITH $20” referred to an in-app simulation, and we considered that consumers would understand the claim to be referring to an amount of money in a real-world investment scenario. The impression given by the ad was that individuals could make significant financial returns after investing relatively small amounts of money. We considered that the impression that financial investment was straightforward and could be undertaken by anyone, no matter their level experience, was strengthened by the ad’s reference to a student seen rapidly making large amounts of money after investing. That suggested that groups who were likely to have fewer resources could easily improve their financial situation through investment and the use of Prosperi Academy’s product. We further considered that the options displayed in the ad of spending 5 minutes, 1 hour or 4 hours investing, suggested to consumers that they would not be required to spend significant periods of time using the Prosperi app to earn large amounts of money. We concluded that the ad took advantage of consumers’ inexperience and credulity by suggesting large returns could be made with minimal time and financial resources. Also, it irresponsibly suggested that financial investment was straightforward, and for everyone, regardless of personal financial circumstances. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 14.1 (Financial products).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Zimran Ltd t/a Prosperi Academy to ensure that they held the relevant substantiation for the claims made in their ads. We told them to ensure their ads made sufficiently clear that the value of financial investments could go down as well as up. We also told them to ensure that they did not irresponsibly take advantage of consumer’s lack of experience or credulity by implying that financial investment was straightforward, and large returns could be made with minimal time and resources.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/zimran-ltd-a24-1265945-zimran-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Endrick Clothing Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","(a) An Instagram post from the account of TV personality Ercan Ramadan @ercan_ram, seen on 3 October 2024, featured a video of a wedding group. The video began with a close up shot of Ercan Ramadan, the groom, lighting a cigar. The camera zoomed out to show seven groomsmen standing behind the bridal couple. Each groomsman was either holding or puffing on a cigar. The caption stated, “La Familia [black heart emoji] Groom & Groomsman suited by @endrickclothing [smoke emoji]”. The post was authored by “ercan_ram and 2 others”. (b) The same video was posted on the Instagram account of Ercan Ramadan’s wife, TV personality Vicky Pattison, @vickypattison, seen on 11 October 2024.",The ASA received two complaints:,"1. & 2. Ercan Ramadan and Endrick Clothing did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. Vicky Pattison did not provide a substantive response to the ASA’s enquiries on point 1. However, she confirmed that any of her posts that featured Endrick Clothing would be labelled as ads in future.Instagram said they had no comments on point 1, but if the complainants believed the ad was in violation of their policies, they could report it to them via their standard reporting channels.","The ASA was concerned by Endrick Clothing and Ercan Ramadan’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a substantive response to our enquiries and told them to do so in future.The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The video began with a close up shot of Ercan Ramadan, the central figure and bridegroom, lighting a cigar. He continued to smoke the cigar throughout the video. The seven groomsmen surrounding him were either smoking cigars or holding them; only the bride did not smoke. The characters did not speak or engage in any other activity. While we acknowledged the ad was for menswear products, we considered that the ad’s principal focus was on smoking and that it was depicted as an enjoyable group activity. We considered that the use of slow motion, the formal setting and the jazz-style music added to the stylised and aspirational tone. We considered that the video presented smoking in an appealing manner and suggested that it was part of a glamourous and aspirational lifestyle. For that reason, we concluded that the ads were irresponsible. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and that they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. We understood that Ercan Ramadan was a director of Endrick Clothing. The post, which featured groom and groomsmen’s outfits by Endrick Clothing, therefore promoted his own brand. Because the post was in non-paid for space under Ercan Ramadan’s control, and was directly connected to the sale of goods, we concluded that it was a marketing communication that fell within the ASA’s remit.Although we acknowledged that Ercan Ramadan stated in the caption “Groom & Groomsman suited by @endrickclothing”, we considered that this did not make sufficiently clear the connection between Ercan Ramadan and Endrick Clothing and that viewers would not necessarily understand that Ercan Ramadan was promoting his own brand. We therefore considered the commercial intent of the ad was unclear, and that the post needed to have included a prominent label upfront, identifying it as an ad, which it did not have. On that basis we concluded that the ad was not obviously identifiable as a marketing communication and as such breached the Code. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications)","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Endrick Clothing Ltd and Ercan Ramadan to ensure that future ads were socially responsible, in particular by not condoning or encouraging smoking. We also told them to ensure their future ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications and the commercial intent was made clear, and that identifiers such as “#ad” were clearly and prominently displayed.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/endrick-clothing-ltd-g24-1264925-endrick-clothing-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Marren Healthcare Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on rehab clinic referral companies. The ad was identified for investigation following complaints received from the Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT). See other rulings published on 18 December 2024. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A website for Compare Rehab, www.compare.rehab, seen in July 2024. Text at the top of the home page stated, “Helping You Find An Addiction Rehab Centre in The UK. Start exploring drug and alcohol rehabs today. Treatment providers are available to answer your questions”, followed by a contact phone number. Text under the subheading “Addiction Rehabilitation Clinic Offers Paths To Recovery” stated, “During the recovery process in our rehabilitation centre, we implement numerous treatment methods frequently in combination with one another. Each person’s treatment plan will be different, and it will be adapted to their specific needs and circumstances.” Text at the bottom of the page stated, “We do not offer specific health advice. We are not an RCA (Remote Clinical Advice service). With your consent we pass your details to our partners that can offer this and take a fee if you begin treatment with a fee-paying provider”, followed by a link to a terms and conditions page with further information. Another page on the website titled “All listings”, found under the tab “Find Rehab” on the home page, featured headline text which stated, “Find Addiction Treatment in your area”. A subheading beneath that stated, “Find Alcohol and Drug Rehab Near You”, followed by a list of UK counties. The website also featured an ""About Compare Rehab” page. Text under the subheading “How we work” stated, “The free helpline offers a discreet and helpful solution for anyone seeking addiction treatment for themselves or a loved one. Our compassionate counsellors and advisors are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to talk about your addiction treatment options.” Further text, under the subheading “Our partnerships”, stated, “We have access to an extensive network of rehabilitation centres all around the United Kingdom. We collaborate with private rehabilitation centres, the NHS, and even a few ‘luxury rehabilitation’ centres. We can recommend patients to rehabilitation centres, and we always put the individual patient’s needs first.”","The complainant, Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT), challenged whether the:","1. & 2. Marren Healthcare Ltd t/a Compare Rehab confirmed that they exclusively operated as a referral centre. They confirmed that they did not provide any direct addiction therapy or healthcare services, and did not employ healthcare professionals. Compare Rehab said they had been unaware of the requirements of the CAP Code, and that they were willing to work with the ASA to make any changes required.","The ASA noted that the home page stated, “During the recovery process in our rehabilitation centre, we implement numerous treatment methods […] Each person’s treatment plan will be different, and it will be adapted to their specific needs and circumstances.” Beneath that it listed various treatment services, including “Alcohol & Drug Detox”, “Rehab Treatment” and “Addiction Therapy”. We also noted the claims made in the “About Us” page of the website that “Our compassionate counsellors and advisors are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to talk about your addiction treatment options” and “Our UK rehab centre network comprises experts in every type of addiction”. We considered that consumers were therefore likely to understand that Compare Rehab provided treatment directly at clinics they operated or owned. We understood however that Compare Rehab functioned as a referral centre that connected consumers seeking help for addiction with registered treatment providers, and that they received commission for doing so. We acknowledged that text at the bottom of the website’s homepage, the “All listings” page and the “About Us” page stated that Compare Rehab did not offer specific health advice, were not a remote clinical advice service, and that they passed consumer’s details on to their partner organisations who offered such services, for a potential fee if treatment was initiated. However, because that information was located at the bottom of each of those pages, we considered it was likely to be overlooked; the ad did not prominently or explicitly make clear what their business model was or how they were funded. We welcomed Compare Rehab’s willingness to make changes to their website. However, the ad did not make immediately clear that they were principally a referral company that received commission for placements with partner rehabilitation facilities, but instead suggested they provided treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated. We concluded, therefore, that the ad implied that Compare Rehab were acting for purposes outside their business, and did not make clear their commercial intent, and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 2.3 (Recognition of Marketing Communications). The “Find Rehab” tab seen at the top of the website included a link titled “All listings”, which led to a page that featured the claims “Find Addiction Treatment in your area” and “Find Alcohol and Drug Rehab Near You”. Further text underneath those claims stated, “No matter where you live, there are drug and alcohol rehab options for you to discover. Treatment providers are waiting to answer your questions. Get started today.” That was followed by a list of hyperlinks for 47 counties in the UK. We considered that consumers were likely to understand those claims to mean that the page would either provide specific details of rehabilitation centres or services they could access via Compare Rehab in each of those counties, or that the individual county information pages linked to from that page would provide such information. Separate sections for NHS treatment provided differing levels of local detail, such as local free services for addiction, drop-in groups, outreach programmes, NHS Foundation services, liaison groups and local charities. However, the “All listings” page contained no specific information about rehabilitation centres. The individual county pages included sections for private rehabilitation centres in the relevant area, but they contained no specific information on rehabilitation centres or services, and instead provided a general overview of how private and residential services worked. Because neither the “All listings” or county-specific pages listed specific details of private rehabilitation centres that could be accessed by Compare Rehab in the local areas, as implied, we concluded that the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading Advertising).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Marren Healthcare Ltd t/a Compare Rehab to ensure that future marketing materials did not falsely imply they were acting for purposes outside their business, not to imply that they owned clinics if they did not, and to make clear that they were a referral company that received commission for their service. In addition, they should not make claims that local rehab centres could be accessed using their website, if that was not the case.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/marren-healthcare-ltd-a24-1252137-marren-healthcare-ltd.html
"ASA Ruling on Vacaciones eDreams, S.L. t/a eDreams","This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on travel industry advertising and environmental claims. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Summary of Council decision: Two Issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Two paid-for online display ads for eDreams, an online travel agency: a. The first ad, seen on 3 June 2024, featured an aerial shot of a jungle and text that stated, “PUERTO RICO A sustainable destination”. b. The second ad, seen on 15 July 2024, stated, “Discover our sustainable trips”.",The ASA challenged whether the following claims were misleading:,"Vacaciones eDreams SL t/a eDreams confirmed the ads were no longer running. They explained that they did not primarily sell package travel (flights and hotels together), and that their travel services were predominantly booked in isolation. For example, customers often booked accommodation through eDreams but booked their transport with another provider. eDreams said they believed consumers would interpret the claim “sustainable destination” as taking into account its future economic, social and environmental impact. For example, a destination that promoted environmental conservation and biodiversity, or that implemented eco-friendly practices. Consumers would not understand the claim as including the environmental impact of reaching the destination. It was a claim about the destination itself. They provided examples which showed that a number of UK media outlets had used the phrase in that way. eDreams said they assessed whether a destination was “sustainable” based on eight criteria, which were whether the destination: had certain official certifications, for example, under the Global Sustainable Tourist Council or UNESCO; informed its intended audience of its sustainability commitments through a dedicated web page; had a dedicated team ensuring it stayed up-to-date with European and international guidelines and regulations on sustainability; was taking steps to implement the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals; was aligned with the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism of the World Tourism Organization; offered accommodation in rural areas; offered social and environmental volunteer-based tourism experiences that promoted green initiatives or programmes that supported the local economy; and whether the destination’s sustainability initiates were audited by an external independent assessor. eDreams said the list of destinations they had assessed as being sustainable was available on their website. Long haul travel was not necessarily required for all customers to reach the destinations – for example, Valencia and Portugal were shown as sustainable destinations for Spanish customers. The edreams.co.uk website was available to consumers globally, and it was therefore the case that UK consumers could, and often did, use the UK website to book while already abroad. They did not limit their sustainable destinations list to those that did not require air travel since doing so would have excluded all destinations and defeated their goal of encouraging consumers to consider the sustainability of their chosen destination.","The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear, that the meaning of all terms must be clear and that absolute environmental claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Ad (a) stated, “PUERTO RICO A sustainable destination”, and ad (b) stated “sustainable trips”. Neither ad was qualified to explain the basis of the claim “sustainable”. The ASA considered that without this required qualification, the claims were ambiguous and unclear. Furthermore, the claims were absolute and a high level of substantiation in support needed to be produced. We acknowledged eDreams had a list of criteria that they used to assess whether or not a destination was “sustainable”. However, to support the absolute claims in the context in which they appeared, we needed to see evidence to demonstrate that Puerto Rico, as a destination (ad (a)), and the “trips” offered by eDreams (ad (b)) were not environmentally damaging. Because the basis of the absolute “sustainable” claims had not been made clear, their meaning was unlikely to be understood and we had not seen sufficiently robust evidence to support them, we concluded that the ads were likely to mislead. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3 (Environmental claims).","The ads must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Vacaciones eDreams SL t/a eDreams to ensure that the basis of future environmental claims, and their meaning, was made clear.

ASA Ruling on Wahed Invest Ltd,,"Six posters for Wahed Invest Ltd, an online Halal investment platform, seen in September and October 2024 on various Transport for London (TfL) services, including London Underground tubes and buses: a. The first poster featured images of two men pointing upwards with their index fingers, and US dollar banknotes on fire. Large text stated, “Join the Money Revolution” above the advertiser’s logo. Smaller text stated, “Capital at risk. Wahed Invest Ltd is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority”. b. The second poster featured similar images as seen in ad (a) of two men pointing upwards with their index fingers, and US dollar banknotes on fire. Large text stated, “Join the Money Revolution”. c. The third poster included the same text and small print as ad (a). The image showed a man holding an open briefcase filled with US dollar and Euro banknotes on fire. d. The fourth poster included the same briefcase image as ad (c), and the same small print as the other ads. A large heading stated, “Withdraw from Exploitation”. Text below stated, “Charging people to borrow money was once called exploitation. Sadly, that perception has changed and now interest has caused a massive wealth gap, enriching the few while the majority get poorer. Join the growing community moving their money to a fairer system, one that serves you! Download Wahed now. Join the Money Revolution”. e. The fifth poster included the same briefcase image as ad (c). Large text stated, “Withdraw from Riba”. Smaller text stated, “Join the Money Revolution. Capital at risk”. f. The sixth poster included the same text and small print as ad (a). It featured a similar image seen in ad (a) of one man pointing upwards and US dollar and Euro banknotes on fire.",Seventy-five complainants challenged whether the ads were offensive.,"Wahed Invest Ltd believed that although their ads were thought-provoking, they were not offensive. They explained they were a digital investment platform which allowed consumers who were predominantly Muslim to invest in an ethical manner which aligned with their faith and values. They said a major component of their platform was that it did not charge consumers interest on loans. They explained that their ads often used the term ‘Riba’, which was an Arabic word that meant ‘excess’ and was commonly used to describe the prohibition of interest under Islamic law. Wahed Invest provided links to several articles on their website, as well as external reports, which they believed highlighted the ways in which interest, or Riba, contributed to social and financial inequality. They also believed inflation was not a properly understood concept and provided a survey which supported that view. They believed it was important to educate people to properly understand interest. They believed Muslims who held the belief that interest contributed to financial inequality had limited options for where to store their money and understood that some often requested for financial institutions to not pay them interest. They believed that, due to rising inflation, consumers who followed Islamic law by not accepting interest on savings suffered from further long-term wealth inequality than those who did accept interest. They said their advertising stated, “Interest has caused a massive wealth gap, enriching the few while the majority get poorer”. They said the burning of banknotes within their ads was designed to be a powerful visual illustration that money stored in a way that was growing at a rate lower than inflation created a decrease in value and purchasing power in real terms. The purpose of the ads was therefore to show that, when inflation grew faster than the rate of savings, money was akin to ‘going up in flames’. They believed all viewers, including those who were not Muslim, would have understood that expression. They said the ads had not criticised specific groups and that they used US dollar and Euro banknotes because they were amongst the most recognised currencies in the world. The purpose of the ads was to promote ethical investing as defined by Islamic law. Wahed Invest acknowledged that currencies were a symbol of national identity but believed the burning of banknotes was not offensive and was portrayed in popular culture, like film and TV. They also believed the burning of money was a commonly understood concept. For example, due to hyperinflation, there had been famous examples of people burning money. They said popular phrases such as ‘money to burn’ and ‘burning a hole in my pocket’ were used to describe someone who had money to spend. They also said the phrase ‘burn rate’ was used to describe how quickly a company was spending money. They believed that, had the idea of burning money been a cause for widespread offence, such language or visual representations would not be as commonly used or as easily understood in society as it was. TfL said their advertising partners, which included Global, reviewed all campaigns before they were approved to run on the network. They said in some cases, such as with ads (a)–(f), TfL also reviewed campaigns internally. They believed the ads complied with TfL’s ad policy and the CAP Code. They received some complaints about the ads and had paused all campaigns from Wahed Invest pending the outcome of the investigation. Global said they reviewed the ads internally and submitted them to the CAP Copy Advice team, who considered they were unlikely to raise issues under the CAP Code. They said they had not received any complaints about the ads. The ads were no longer appearing.","The CAP Code stated that ads must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. Particular care must be taken to avoid causing offence on certain grounds, including race (which includes nationality). We acknowledged Wahed Invest’s view that the burning of banknotes illustrated that money which grew at a rate lower than inflation decreased in value in real terms. The ads represented the expression that viewers’ money was ‘going up in flames’ and that images of burning money were commonly encountered. However, regardless of whether viewers would have understood that message or understood it as a defiant act designed to show a challenge to financial institutions, the currencies which were burned in all of the ads were clearly visible as US dollar and Euro banknotes. In the case of the US dollars depicted, in all instances the ads showed the words “The United States of America” in flames. The ads were shown on several sites across the TfL network, including on London Underground tubes, which was an untargeted medium, and they were therefore likely to be seen by many people. It was also a service regularly used by tourists. Due to the vast number of people who used TfL services and because London was a tourist hotspot, people from the United States or Eurozone countries would have seen the ads. We considered some viewers, particularly people from the United States or Eurozone countries, would have viewed their nation’s currency as being culturally significant and a symbol of their national identity. Although we acknowledged Wahed Invest’s view that they had not directly criticised a specific group, and that depictions of burning banknotes were commonly encountered, we considered the burning of banknotes would have caused serious offence to some viewers. We therefore concluded that the ads were likely to cause serious offence. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 4.1 (Harm and offence).","The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of. We told Wahed Invest Ltd to ensure that future ads did not cause serious offence, including by featuring images of burning US dollar or Euro banknotes.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/wahed-invest-ltd-g24-1262171-wahed-invest-ltd.html

If you are in need of quick admission into a local centre we will contact our network of clinics and be able to recommend a centre based on the parameters given by you”.","The complainant, Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT), challenged whether the:",Action Rehab did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Action Rehab’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquires and told them to do so in future. The website home page stated, “Are you suffering from an addiction and in need of help? Call our team now […] For urgent help call us”, listed several “Addictions We Treat”, including drug and alcohol addictions, and stated that “our addiction treatment experts […] can help you decide on a rehab plan that will work best for your needs and budget”. While the page also included references to “supporting” and “helping” with addictions, we considered that the claims regarding help with addictions and references to in-house addiction treatment experts, along with the “Countries”, “Counties” and “Regions” list of locations of apparent rehabilitation services they offered, would likely give consumers the impression that Action Rehab provided treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated.However, in the absence of a response from Action Rehab, we understood that they functioned as a referral centre that connected consumers seeking help for addiction with registered treatment providers, and that they received commission for doing so. We acknowledged that small text at the bottom of the website’s home page and “About Us” page stated that Action Rehab was an advisory service, and that text on the “About Us” page stated that they were a referral and advisory service that worked with rehabilitation clinics, and recommended centres to consumers. However, because that information was located at the bottom of the website’s pages and in small text, or on the “About Us” page, we considered that it was likely to be overlooked. Also, the ad did not prominently or explicitly make clear what Action Rehab’s business model was and how they were funded. The ad did not make immediately clear that Action Rehab were principally a referral company that received commission for placements with partner rehabilitation facilities, and instead implied they provided treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated. We therefore concluded that the ad implied that they were acting for purposes outside their business, and did not make clear their commercial intent. The ad therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 2.3 (Recognition of Marketing Communications). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not claim that the marketer (or any other entity referred to), the marketing communication, or the advertised product had been approved, endorsed or authorised by any public or other body if it had not, or without complying with the terms of the approval, endorsement or authorisation. In addition, marketing communications must not falsely claim that the marketer, or other entity referred to in the marketing communication, is a signatory to a code of conduct. Both the home page and the “About Us” page of Action Rehab’s website displayed the Care Quality Commission’s (CQC) name and logo. We considered that consumers were therefore likely to understand that Action Rehab were regulated by the CQC. However, we understood that as a referral service, Action Rehab were not CQC registered. We therefore concluded that the ad had breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.50 and 3.51 (Endorsements and testimonials).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Action Rehab to ensure that their advertising did not falsely imply they were acting for purposes outside their business, not to imply that they owned clinics if they did not and to make clear that they were a referral company that received commission for their service. We also told them not to claim or imply in their advertising that they had been approved or authorised by any public or other body if that was not the case. We referred the matter to CAP’s compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/action-rehab-a24-1252142-action-rehab.html
ASA Ruling on Addiction Recovery Systems Ltd t/a Rehab Guide,This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on rehab clinic referral companies. The ad was identified for investigation following complaints received from the Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT).,"A website for Rehab Guide, www.rehabguide.co.uk seen on 12 July 2024 included the claim “Free advice today"" and “FREE SUPPORT FOR ALL ADDICTIONS”. The website footer contained the text “Rehab Guide is a free help and assessment service to help you choose the best drug & alcohol rehab for you. We will give you guidance on the best treatment options for your circumstances”.","The complainant, Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT), challenged whether the ad falsely implied that the marketer was acting for purposes outside its business and did not make clear their commercial intent.","Addiction Recovery Systems Ltd t/a Rehab Guide said they were dedicated to assisting enquirers to find services that aligned with their requirements and budget. They said most of their enquirers could not afford private services and they were committed to helping them navigate the social, NHS and charitable sectors to find help. They estimated that private individual referrals made up about 10% of their custom, with 90% of their income derived from corporate business services. They said their free advice centre offered services over the phone, email and face-to-face when necessary. They received a consultation fee for referrals to private clinics. They also said that people and companies that chose residential rehab facilities paid the clinics directly, at the same cost they would if they contacted the clinic directly, so their services to the inquirer were free of charge. They believed that their website clearly explained their business, that they were a free advice centre that also provided addiction treatment services, including medically supervised home detox, counselling services, sober companion services, coaching and psychotherapy. Rehab Guide said they would make changes to their website following the investigation.","The ASA noted the homepage stated, “Rehab Guide is a free help and assessment service to help you choose the best drug & alcohol rehab for you. We will give you guidance on the best treatment options for your circumstances”, “FREE SUPPORT FOR ALL ADDICTIONS” and “Free advice today"". We considered that consumers would have understood that Rehab Guide offered free help and advice with no commercial incentive. We also considered the claims “At Rehab Guide, we provide professional alcohol and drug addiction treatment including detox, rehab and counselling – both in-patient and outpatient”, “our experienced advisors” and “all of our […] treatment centres” were likely to be understood by consumers to mean that in some circumstances they would provide residential treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated, and did not exclusively refer consumers to other services for residential rehabilitation. We noted Rehab Guide did signpost enquirers to free addiction services, and that they did provide a free advice centre and addiction treatment services. However, we understood that Rehab Guide was also a referral centre that placed consumers seeking help for addiction with third-party treatment providers and they received commission for doing so. The website did not prominently or explicitly make that clear, or that they did not provide in person residential treatment directly and that those treatments listed on the website would be from selected third party providers. We welcomed Rehab Guides assurance that they would amend their website. However, the ad did not make clear that they received commission for referrals, placing and facilitating an individual’s stay in partner rehabilitation facilities, and instead suggested that they provided residential treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated, as well as offering unbiased advice to those seeking help with addiction. We concluded, therefore, the ad implied that Rehab Guide were acting for purposes outside their business, and that it did not make clear their commercial intent, The ad therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 2.3 (Recognition of Marketing Communications)","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Addiction Recovery Systems Ltd t/a Rehab Guide to ensure that their advertising did not falsely imply they were acting for purposes outside their business, not to imply that they provided residential treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated if they did not and to make clear that they were a referral company that received commission for their service.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/addiction-recovery-systems-ltd-a24-1252122-addiction-recovery-systems-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Auto Finesse Ltd,,"An Instagram post by Auto Finesse, a car detailing and cleaning company, seen on 7 October 2024, featured a video of two male garage workers appearing to watch a woman wearing a short skirt and high heels walk down the street. The camera briefly focused on the lower half of the woman’s body. One of the men said, “Hello hello, now what are you doing here, gorgeous?” He then whistled and said to the other man, “Hey come and take a look at this little one. Something else. Now tell me, you wouldn’t want to have a go on that little beauty? Eh.” Both men laughed. The camera then panned to the woman, who walked past a car being cleaned. A voice-over stated, “Auto Finesse. For the things that make you go ooh.” A caption on the post stated, “For the things that make you go Oohhhhhhh!”.","The complainant, who believed the ad trivialised catcalling and sexual harassment, challenged whether it objectified women and promoted a harmful gender stereotype.","Auto Finesse Ltd acknowledged that the ad included a gender stereotype, but said its purpose was to reflect a scenario that viewers would find familiar and humorous. They did not believe the gender stereotype used was harmful or offensive. They said the ad was part of a campaign called ‘Things That Make You Go Oohhhhhhh”. The purpose of the ad was to lead viewers into thinking a particular situation was unfolding, before revealing a ‘twist’ that related to their business. They believed the unexpected twist engaged viewers by playing on their assumptions to create a memorable moment. Auto Finesse said the scenario depicted was not intended to make light of or endorse inappropriate behaviours. The interaction between the two men and the woman was exaggerated for comedic effect and captured the attention of the viewer without condoning or normalising harmful behaviours. They said it did not feature explicit language, gestures or settings associated with catcalling or sexual harassment. They believed the ad emphasised playfulness and did not objectify women. They said the ad had not received negative feedback in the Instagram comments section and believed those who saw the ad were not offended.","The CAP Code stated that ads must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, must not cause serious or widespread offence and must not include gender stereotypes that were likely to cause harm. The ad depicted a woman wearing a short skirt and high heels, walking down the street while two male garage workers appeared to watch her. We considered phrases said by the men, such as “[…] now what are you doing here, gorgeous?” and “Hey come and take a look at this little one, something else” gave the impression that they were acutely observing the woman and commenting specifically on her physical appearance. That impression was reinforced by one scene that briefly focused on the lower half of the woman’s body, emphasising her short skirt and legs. We considered those scenes gave the impression that the men were viewing the woman as a sexual object. We considered that the phrase “Now tell me, you wouldn’t want to have a go on that little beauty”, within the context of the men ostensibly commenting on the woman’s physical appearance, was sexual in nature. We also considered the manner in which one of the men loudly whistled would have likely been perceived by some Instagram users as ‘catcalling’, which was a form of sexual harassment. Despite the woman not looking at or engaging with the men, they continued to comment on her physical appearance, which gave the ad a voyeuristic feel and further reinforced that they viewed her as a sexual object. We acknowledged the ad ended by revealing that the men were, in fact, observing and talking about a vintage car on the opposite side of the road and not the physical appearance of the woman. However, that reveal did not negate the impression that the woman had been viewed as a sexual object throughout most of the ad and up until that point. We considered that the reveal instead trivialised and excused the originally implied behaviour of the men. We also considered the phrase “For the things that make you go ooh” at the end of the ad was likely to be interpreted as being in relation to both the car and the physical appearance of the woman. That phrase therefore reinforced the impression that the woman had been objectified and stereotyped for her physical appearance. Finally, we considered that the ad was likely to have the effect of objectifying a woman by using her physical appearance to draw attention to an unrelated product. For those reasons, we considered the ad objectified women by trivialising catcalling and sexual harassment and gave the impression that their bodies were sexual objects. We therefore concluded that the ad included a harmful gender stereotype and was likely to cause serious offence. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Auto Finesse Ltd to ensure that future ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious offence, including by featuring a harmful gender stereotype by objectifying or sexualising women.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/auto-finesse-ltd-a24-1263473-auto-finesse-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Beer52 Ltd,,"Two emails for Wine52, a wine and beer subscription service, sent to a subscriber. a. The first email, received on 20 April 2024, was headed “Welcome to the Club!” and stated, “We’re thrilled you’ve joined us!”. It included several sub-headed sections, including a box in the body of the email with the sub-heading “Invite your friends today”. Text below stated, “Fancy a free case on us? Send a delicious wine to your friends and earn a free case […]"". A hyperlinked “Send invite” button followed. b. The second email, received on 24 April 2024, had the subject line “Get ambassador rewards”. Text below stated, “Nice one, you’re in the Club […] We think now is a good time to tell you how to get loads of great rewards from Wine52! It’s easy, every time you refer a friend they get their first case at 50% OFF and you get a FREE case of wine […]”. A hyperlinked “Find out more” button followed.","The complainant, who had attempted to take up both offers but had not qualified for a free case of wine, challenged whether the promotions had been administered fairly.","Beer52 Ltd said they had reviewed their referral scheme communications following the complaint and were updating them to ensure the conditions of the offer were communicated more clearly. They believed, however, that the terms of the scheme were widely understood by their members and said they were available on their website.","The ASA considered that, in the absence of any other relevant information in the ad, recipients of ad (a) were likely to expect that, by sending gifts of wine to friends, they would receive a free case of wine. We considered recipients of ad (b), again in the absence of any other relevant information in the ad, were likely to expect that, when they referred a friend who took out a subscription, the friend would receive 50% off the price of their first case of wine and that the subscriber who referred them would receive a free case of wine. The “Send invite” button in ad (a) went to a web page where a heading stated “Earn a free case. Share 50% off wine”. Text underneath stated, “Gift a friend a half-price case of 3 bottles of wine. You’ll receive a free case and 40 points when they go on to be a full-paying member […]”. A heading further down stated, “Still got questions?” and was followed by questions and answers which included the following: “How does it work? – Simply invite your friends by sharing your unique link […] We’ll track how many people sign up and reward you with 40 points and a completely free case for every person who goes on to be a full paying member”; and “When will I get my free case? – A free case voucher code will be shown on your account for each successful referral. Your codes are rewarded after your friend’s subscription recurs at full price […]”.The “Find out more” button in ad (b) went to a different web page. Text stated, “Join our beer club and each time you refer a friend, you’ll get a free case of wine […]”. Further down the page, a heading “Still got questions?” was followed by questions and answers. The first stated, “How does it work? – Every time you invite a friend and they stay for their second case, we give you a free reward case of wine (unless you send a Golden Ticket). Once you have completed a certain number of successful referrals, you also receive one of our bonus rewards. So after 3 successful referrals you get a free case of beer from Beer52. After 5 you get £50 in points to spend in the online shop, and so on. Don’t worry, you also still get the free wine each time!” Another stated, “What is a Golden Ticket? – A Golden Ticket is a little something we give you that makes it much easier to invite friends to Wine52. It enables you to send them a FREE case of wine with FREE postage! However, since we are giving a 100% free case to your friend, we can’t also give you a reward case – we just can’t afford it! Go to Invite a friend to see if you have any Golden Tickets”. Beer52 had referred us to the terms and conditions on their website. They began with a section headed “Refer a friend”. Text stated, “By following your referral link or by entering your referral code at signup, they’ll be able to claim 50% off their first case. If your friend stays with us for a full price case we’ll award you with a free case of wine as our way of saying thank you”. We acknowledged that it was customary for ads to contain links to more detailed information about offers and for full terms and conditions to appear on a separate web page. Nevertheless, ads still needed to include all significant conditions related to the offer, including how to participate and any restrictions, where the omission of such conditions was likely to mislead, unless they were significantly limited by time and space. We considered that ads (a) and (b), which were emails and therefore not limited in space in the way ads in some other media might be, were not significantly limited by time and space to justify the omission of significant conditions. We considered that the requirement in relation to ad (a) that the recipient of the gift of wine needed to pay to take out a subscription for the sender to qualify for the free case of wine was a significant condition, the omission of which from the ad was likely to mislead consumers. Similarly, in relation to ad (b), we considered that the requirement that the friend needed to subscribe for a designated period of time so that they received their second case before the sender qualified for a free case of wine was a significant condition of the offer and that the omission of that condition from the ad itself was likely to mislead consumers. We therefore concluded that because the ads omitted significant conditions regarding how to participate, they were misleading and the promotions therefore breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.2 (Promotional marketing) and 8.17 and 8.17.1 (Significant conditions for promotions).",The promotions must not be run again in the forms complained of. We told Beer52 Ltd to ensure that ads for future promotions did not mislead by omitting significant conditions.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/beer52-ltd-a24-1251988-beer52-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Better Health and Wellness,This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on laser eye surgery referral companies. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system.,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Better Health & Wellness, posted on 24 April 2024, featured the caption “Leading laser vision correction offers here”. In a video below the caption, an individual addressed the camera and said, “This is how healthy your eyes actually are. I'm about to test you to tell you how healthy your eyes actually are. All you have to do is pick one out of the 10 colours that is different from the rest. And only about 5% of people can complete all four stages, let me know if you can.” A separate voice-over then stated, “To pass the full test, swipe left and start.” Text below the video stated, “Lasik Eye Surgery Prices”, besides which was a link labelled “Learn more”. The link led to a landing page which contained a series of additional links that stated, “Eye Surgery To Correct Vision Cost (see Laser eye Surgeries In Covent Garden)”, “Lasic [sic] Eye Surgery Cost (see Laser eye Surgeries In Covent Garden)”, “Lasic [sic] Eye Surgery Cost – Lasic [sic] Eye Surgery Cost (see Laser eye Surgeries In Covent Garden)”, “Laser Eye Surgeries Near Me”, “Eye Surgeries Clinic Near Me – Lasic [sic] eye Surgery Cost (see Laser eye Surgeries In Covent Garden)”, Laser Cataract Surgery”, “Eye Surgery to Correct Vision Cost”, “Laser Eye Surgery Cost” and “Eye Laser Center”.","The ASA challenged whether the ad was misleading regarding the nature of the content that it linked through to, and that it falsely implied the marketer was acting for purposes outside its business.",Media Quest Group t/a Better Health and Wellness did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Better Health and Wellness’ lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay).

We understood that domain parking was the registration of an internet domain name without that domain being associated with services such as email or a website. Domain parking could be done for various reasons, including reserving the domain name for future development or to protect the domain name from use by others. Domain parking could also be monetised by operating a single-page website which hosted ads, as was the case here.

ASA Ruling on Help 4 Addiction Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on rehab clinic referral companies. The ad was identified for investigation following complaints received from the Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT).

Help 4 Addiction Ltd stated that nowhere on the website did they say that they owned any clinics.They explained that one out of every ten enquiries they received had no funding. They supported those individuals to access free treatment. They also supported, at no extra charge, those who were not suffering from addiction directly but who were affected, such as family members. They confirmed that they operated www.rehubs.com which was an online rehabilitation service for addictions. It was not CQC (Care Quality Commission) registered as online therapy did not need a CQC registration.

For instance, it stated, “We offer a range of treatment options tailored to individual needs, including counselling, therapy, detoxification, and aftercare support”, “What Addictions Can We Help Treat?” and ““Find The Perfect Treatment For You … we can ensure you receive the right support”. It further stated, “What Treatment Best Suits You” and listed the options as “Residential Rehab”, “Home Detox” and “Online Rehab”. We considered consumers were likely to interpret the claims to mean that Help 4 Addiction provided treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated. We acknowledged the changes made by Help 4 Addiction on the website and that they ran an online rehabilitation service for addictions that was not CQC registered. We understood however that apart from that, Help 4 Addiction was primarily a referral centre that connected consumers seeking support for addiction with a selection of registered treatment providers, and that they received commission for doing so. The changes to the website included a question mark by the phone number at the top of the home page that stated that they worked with a network of addiction rehabs. However, that information had to be clicked on to reveal those details. The website therefore was still not immediately clear that Help 4 Addiction did not provide in person treatment directly and that those treatments listed on the website would be from selected third-party registered providers. The website also did not prominently or explicitly make clear what their business model was and how they were funded. Because the ad did not make immediately clear that they were principally a referral company that received commission for placements with partner rehabilitation facilities, and instead suggested they provided treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated, we concluded that the ad implied that Help 4 Addiction were acting for purposes outside their business, and did not make clear their commercial intent, and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 2.3 (Recognition of Marketing Communications). The home page stated, “Find Your Local Rehab” and “Locate nearby rehab centres for addiction treatment and support. Find local rehab options to begin your journey to recovery”. Text adjacent to that claim stated, “START YOUR JOURNEY TODAY” and linked to the “Find Rehab Clinic” page. That page stated, “This section covers all of the listings for rehab treatment clinics via the locations we cover. Help4Addiction works with a number of rehab clinics across the UK as well as abroad. Depending on where you want to go for rehab, you can browse through the list of areas and find a rehab clinic that is right for you”. We considered that consumers were likely to understand the claims to mean that the “Find Rehab Clinic” page would provide specific details of rehabilitation centres that they could access in each of those local areas in the UK and abroad. The “Find Rehab Clinic” page listed and hyperlinked 58 towns and cities, and 46 counties, in the UK. In addition, it separately listed and hyperlinked Northen Ireland, Scotland, Thailand, UK and Europe. While the links provided some level of local detail, for instance some listed local free services for addiction, no details of individual clinics were provided. We understood that Help 4 Addiction worked with 20 in-person treatment centres in the UK. The locations listed on the “Find Rehab Clinic” page therefore far exceeded the number of centres they operated with. Because the “Find Rehab Clinic” page did not list specific details of rehabilitation centres in the local areas and beyond as implied, and because we understood they did not provide access to clinics in all the areas listed, we concluded that the ad was misleading. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading Advertising). The CAP Code stated that before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers were likely to regard as objective and that were capable of objective substantiation. We considered that consumers were likely to understand that the claim “Regularly Featured In The Press”, alongside the four media logos, to mean that Help 4 Addiction and their work had been discussed and highlighted within those media entities regularly and including recently. Help 4 Addiction submitted four press articles, two from The Sun and two from The Daily Mirror. They also provided links to two BBC radio shows and a short online video of a clip from one of those radio shows, as well as links to a Sky News podcast and an online video of Sky News. The two articles from The Sun, one from The Daily Mirror, the Sky News podcast and the two BBC radio links discussed the CEO of Help 4 Addiction’s former life as a police officer and his struggles with cocaine addiction. The Sun article and the Sky News podcast mentioned Help 4 Addiction, amongst other resources for drink and drugs problems, and highlighted the Help 4 Addiction website. Help 4 Addiction were not explicitly named in The Daily Mirror article or the BBC radio items. The second article from The Daily Mirror highlighted the high levels of drink and drug addiction in the police force. It explained that Help 4 Addiction and Rehubs.com had teamed up with the Police Federation partnership to offer free support. An online video showed Help 4 Addiction’s CEO being interviewed on Sky News. The interview discussed a survey Help 4 Addiction had carried out on the increase in alcohol consumption in lockdown. We acknowledged that Help 4 Addiction and their CEO had featured in articles or media for The Sun, BBC, Sky News and The Daily Mirror. However, in the majority of the evidence we had assessed, the focus had been on the CEO’s early life and his recovery from cocaine addiction. While Help 4 Addiction was often mentioned in those pieces, the references were brief and the media itself was not focused on the company or any work they did. The exceptions to that were The Daily Mirror article that talked about the partnership Help 4 Addiction had with the Police Federation partnership and the Sky News interview, which was from 2020, around the survey Help 4 Addiction had done on alcohol consumption in lockdown. Taken as a whole, while we acknowledged the evidence provided by Help 4 Addiction, we considered it did not demonstrate that Help 4 Addiction’s work alone had regularly and recently featured in the media outlined on the home page and therefore concluded that the claim was misleading. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading Advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Help 4 Addiction Ltd to ensure that their advertising did not falsely imply they were acting for purposes outside their business, not to imply that they provided treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated if they did not and to make clear that they were a referral company that received commission for their service. They must not make claims that a local rehab facility could be accessed using their website if that was not the case and that they must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers were likely to regard as objective.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/help-4-addiction-ltd-a24-1252124-help-4-addiction-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on IT Career Change Ltd,,"A listing on www.cv-library.co.uk, a job vacancy website, for the company IT Career Change Ltd, seen on 3 September 2024, featured a heading which stated, “Trainee Health & Safety Advisor”. Text underneath stated, “Are you looking to kick-start a new career in health & safety? We are recruiting for companies who are looking to employ our Health & Safety Traineeship graduates to keep up their growth. The best part is you will not need any previous experience as full training will be provided. You will also have the reassurance of a job guarantee within 20 miles of your location upon completion […]”. Further text explained how the programme worked including information about the different training modules and being placed into a job upon completion. Text at the bottom of the listing stated, “Please note that this is a training course and fees apply”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad was misleading because it did not make sufficiently clear that it was for a training course and career placement programme rather than a genuine trainee job role.,"IT Career Change Ltd said that since 2019, their ads had had over 750,000 views and they had received over 30,000 applications as a result. To their knowledge there had only been two people who had complained that their ads were misleading, which equated to 0.0002% of people who had viewed them. Based on those figures, they did not believe the ad was misleading. They pointed out that in the copy of the ad, text stated, “The traineeship is completed in 4 easy steps, you can be placed into your first role in as little as 3-6 months” and then listed all the training applicants would need to have completed before being placed into the role. The ad then referred to the cost of the training where it stated, “At a one off cost of £1095, or a deposit of £162 followed by 10 interest free monthly instalments of £113, this represents a great opportunity to start a rewarding career in health & safety and have a real career ladder to start climbing. If you are not offered a role at the end of the training we will refund 100% of your course fees”. Applicants were therefore made fully aware that a cost was involved to fund their training before they would be placed into a role. They said that was reinforced by text at the bottom of the ad, directly above the ‘apply’ button, which stated, “Please note that this is a training course and fees apply”. They said their ads also included filter questions that had to be ticked before someone could submit an application, which made sure they had understood that it was a training package that upon completion would lead onto a job role and also made them fully aware that the training was self-funded. Applicants were required to tick a box on two separate questions to say they understood. They therefore believed it was impossible for someone to be unaware of the training element before applying. They further explained that they did not want applications from people who had not understood what was involved, as it wasted their consultants’ time in trying to contact them; they made it as clear as possible in the ad what was involved so as to avoid that.","The ASA understood that the listing appeared on a job vacancy website and therefore consumers visiting that site would be searching for employment opportunities. We also understood that users of the website would usually access the ad via searches or other job lists which would include the job title and a short extract from the start of the listing. Given that, it was important that any initial information made it clear that they were clicking through to view a training course rather than a job vacancy. We considered that the heading of the ad which stated, “Trainee Health & Safety Advisor” and the text immediately underneath that stated, “Are you looking to kick-start a new career in health & safety? We are recruiting for companies who are looking to employ our Health & Safety Traineeship graduates to keep up their growth. The best part is you will not need any previous experience as full training will be provided” were likely to be understood by consumers to mean the ad was for a trainee health & safety role and that candidates who had little or no experience in that sector were welcome to apply for the role, plus full training would be provided on the job. We understood that users of the website would see that initial text first before clicking into the full listing. Whilst we acknowledged that further text in the body of the ad explained that IT Career Change were promoting a training course and career placement programme and that fees applied, we considered that it was not sufficient to counter the strong impression given by the heading “Trainee Health & Safety Advisor” and the accompanying text at the top of the ad stating “Are you looking to kick-start a new career in health & safety? We are recruiting for companies who are looking to employ our Health & Safety Traineeship graduates to keep up their growth. The best part is you will not need any previous experience as full training will be provided” that the ad was for a genuine employment vacancy. We considered that the text in the body of the ad contradicted rather than qualified the headline and accompanying initial text. Also, we noted that this text would not have been visible in the search result and would only have become visible by clicking into the full listing. For those reasons, we considered that the ad did not make sufficiently clear that it was for a training course and career placement programme which consumers had to pay for, rather than a paid employment role with training on the job. We therefore concluded that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification) and 20.2 (Employment).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told IT Career Change Ltd to ensure their ads did not misleadingly imply they were offering genuine job vacancies if they were offering paid-for training courses and career placement programmes. This should be reflected in the initial job listing that users of the website would view in a search result and in the headline of the ad as well as the body text.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/it-career-change-ltd-a24-1258686-it-career-change-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Marketing VF Ltd t/a The Eco Experts,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on laser eye surgery referral companies. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad for Lasik Eyes, published on 9 May 2024, featured a caption which stated, “LOOKING FOR: People over the age of 65 living in the UK who are interested in our REVOLUTIONARY laser eye procedure”. In a video below the caption, a woman addressing the camera stated, “We're looking for people in the UK who are interested in this revolutionary laser eye surgery procedure. Almost all patients have achieved 20/20 vision with this brilliant procedure and it's all over in a matter of minutes. Tap below to see if you're eligible.” A link labelled “Learn more” was seen under the video. The link led to a website, web.lasik-eyes.co.uk, which was presented as an advertorial article. Headline text at the top of the page stated, “Rapid Advances in Corrective Eye Surgery Have Made It More Effective Than Ever Before”, beneath which was a photo of a woman undergoing an eye examination. Further text on the page stated, “A quick, virtually painless procedure […] With thousands of patients choosing Lasik Eyes to help them transform their vision each year […] Quick Procedure, Lasting Benefits”. Under the subheading “Who should I work with?” further text stated, “One of the most trusted and effective free online services is Lasik Eyes which finds Britain’s leading optical surgeons in your local area. Our partners currently have more than 300 free consultations available”. Various links found on the page brought up a series of questions to answer, which included entering an email address and phone number. When completed, a referral was generated telling consumers they would be contacted to arrange a free laser eye consultation.",The ASA challenged whether the:,"1. Marketing VF Ltd t/a Lasik Eyes confirmed that they operated as a lead generation service, connecting consumers with qualified eye surgery providers, and that they did not directly offer laser-eye surgery procedures themselves. They believed that the ad clearly communicated that they were a lead generation company. They said the statement “We're looking for people in the UK who are interested in this revolutionary laser eye surgery procedure” had been intended to inform consumers about laser eye surgery as a procedure offered by providers they partnered with, rather than to suggest that Lasik Eyes were themselves a provider. Lasik Eyes accepted that it was essential for consumers to recognise their role as a lead generation service. They highlighted the language used in their ad; the ad referred to “our partners” and stated that Lasik Eyes “finds Britain’s leading optical surgeons in your local area”, which they further believed clarified their status as a service connecting users with providers, rather than acting as a direct surgical service. They also said they had included a disclaimer on the landing page to make the nature of their business and the commercial intent of their ads clear. Lasik Eyes said that they matched consumers based on their requirements and eligibility for certain suppliers. They confirmed that, at the time of the complaint, they only had one live provider available through their laser eye surgery campaign, but that consumers were informed of that by the number of potential matches returned to them. Their aim was to offer consumers a variety of options over time, as additional partners joined their platform. 2. Lasik Eyes believed that the claims seen in the ad were supported by reputable sources and accurately reflected the typical patient experience of laser eye surgery procedures. They said the claim “revolutionary laser eye procedure” reflected the technology used by their provider partner, which they said was recognised as industry leading. Improved precision, minimised surgical times and reduced recovery periods. They referred to their partners website, which contained details of the technology used in their procedures. Regarding the claim “Almost all patients have achieved 20/20 vision”, Lasik Eyes referred to an informational website’s article which stated that research from 2016 had shown that 99% of patients who had undergone LASIK eye surgery had achieved 20/40 vision or better, and more than 90% had achieved 20/20 vision. They said the claim “it's all over in a matter of minutes” aligned with NHS information which advised that LASIK eye surgery usually took between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on the specific procedure. In relation to the claim “More Effective Than Ever Before”, Lasik Eyes referred to an article published by the same informational website as above. This article stated that technological advancements had significantly improved the outcomes and safety of vision correction surgeries, and that research had shown that recent technological improvements have made corrective surgery safer and more effective. They said that the “virtually painless” claim was based on an article published by a well-known eye hospital, which stated that LASIK and similar laser procedures were generally painless, with only minimal, short-term discomfort, usually lasting four to six hours post-surgery, with most patients able to return to regular activities the following day. While Lasik Eyes believed those articles supported the claims made in their ad, they said they were willing to make changes to the wording of their claims to better represent general but not guaranteed outcomes. They also said they were willing to add more prominent wording that reminded consumers of individual variances, and that outcomes could vary based on personal health, and would strengthen their internal framework to ensure a consistent culture of compliance with the CAP Code in future.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not falsely claim or imply that the marketer was acting for purposes outside its trade, business, craft or profession. It further stated that marketing communications must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. The ASA considered that the ad presented Lasik Eyes as a provider of laser eye surgery. The caption referred to “our REVOLUTIONARY laser eye procedure” and the individual in the video stated, “We're looking for people in the UK who are interested in this revolutionary laser eye surgery procedure.” We considered consumers would interpret those statements, especially the references to “our” and “we’re”, to mean that Lasik Eyes had developed their own proprietary laser eye surgery and, as such, consumers would understand that Lasik Eyes were a qualified provider of laser eye surgery. Later in the video consumers were encouraged to “Tap below to see if you’re eligible”, which we considered reinforced the impression that Lasik Eyes offered laser eye surgery, and consumers would understand that, by clicking on the link, Lasik Eyes would assess their eligibility for any such surgery. The landing page linked to by the Facebook ad included text near the top of the page which stated, “With thousands of patients choosing Lasik Eyes to help them transform their vision each year”. We considered consumers would understand that to mean Lasik Eyes had directly helped to improve patients’ vision by carrying out the laser eye surgery themselves. Furthermore, the landing page invited consumers to select their birth year from a list and click through to check their suitability for laser eye surgery. Again, we considered that would give consumers the impression that Lasik Eyes were qualified to assess suitability for surgery, and that they provided the treatment directly. We understood, however, that Lasik Eyes was a lead generation service that passed on consumers’ details to third-party laser eye surgery providers, rather than providing those services themselves, and that they received commission for doing so.We acknowledged that text further down the landing page stated, “Lasik Eyes […] finds Britain’s leading optical surgeons in your local area” and “Our partners currently have more than 300 free consultations available”. However, that information was located further down the page, and did not explicitly state that Lasik Eyes were a lead generation company. We therefore considered that those statements were not prominent or clear enough to change the overall impression that Lasik Eyes provided the laser eye surgery. We also noted that the Facebook ad did not include any information which indicated that Lasik Eyes was a lead generation company. We therefore considered that neither the Facebook ad nor the subsequent landing page had prominently or explicitly made that, or their commercial intent, clear. The ad did not make immediately clear that they were principally a lead generation company that received commission for connecting consumers with laser eye surgery providers, and instead suggested they provided treatment directly. We therefore concluded that the ad implied that Lasik Eyes were acting for purposes outside their business and did not make clear their commercial intent. The ad therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 2.3 (Recognition of Marketing Communications) and 3.1 (Misleading advertising). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead consumers by exaggerating the capability or performance of a product. CAP guidance on ads for laser eye surgery stated that marketers should be careful when making claims about how advanced or innovative their procedures were, that they should not state or imply that it was always successful, or that recovery from laser eye surgery would be immediate. It also advised marketers against making claims that laser eye surgery was completely safe, or free from side effects. The ad, and landing page linked to from the ad, included claims about the efficacy and nature of the laser eye surgery; for example, “our revolutionary laser eye procedure” and “more effective than ever before”. From those claims, we considered consumers would understand the advertised laser eye treatment was a new and innovative type of laser eye surgery and that it was more advanced than those available by other laser eye surgery providers. Furthermore, within the context of offering an advanced treatment, we considered that consumers would interpret the claim “almost all patients have achieved 20/20 vision” to mean they would likely attain perfect, or nearly perfect vision, after treatment. In addition, we considered consumers would understand from the ad that there were little to no side effects as a result of laser eye surgery. The ad stated, “it’s all over in a matter of minutes” which we considered implied that the procedure, and its recovery time, was complete within a very short period, and that normal day-to-day activities could be resumed immediately after treatment. The ad also stated that the procedure was “virtually painless”, which we considered implied that patients would not experience any side effects, and that in cases where patients did experience side effects, they were likely to be insignificant. We therefore expected Lasik Eyes would be able to demonstrate that their advertised procedure was an innovative form of laser eye surgery, that it would result in perfect vision, its procedure and recovery time was almost immediate, and that significant side effects would not be experienced. We assessed the evidence supplied to us by the advertiser. We first examined the website of the partner laser eye surgery clinic, provided to demonstrate the technology underpinning the procedure. It stated that the procedure was carried out using two different lasers, which we understood were used in LASIK surgery. We further understood that LASIK was a commonly performed and well-established type of laser eye surgery and, on that basis, we considered that it, alone, did not represent a new or innovative form of laser eye surgery. Because we did not receive any further evidence demonstrating the advertised procedure was industry leading, we considered that the use of the word “revolutionary” had the effect of exaggerating how advanced the procedure was and, therefore, was likely to mislead. Next, we assessed the eye-health website provided to substantiate the efficacy of LASIK surgery. We noted that it referred to research from 2016 that had shown 99% of patients who had undergone LASIK eye surgery had achieved 20/40 vision or better, and more than 90% had achieved 20/20 vision. While we acknowledged that most patients who underwent laser eye surgery experienced an improvement in their vision, we were not provided with the full study and as such we were unable to assess the sample used, specifically the eyesight or ocular health of those included in the research. Furthermore, we understood that individuals who had achieved 20/20 vision as a result of laser eye surgery may continue to experience or develop other vision issues, such as light scatter side effects, which we considered were significant issues that could affect an individual’s quality of vision. We were not provided with any evidence to demonstrate the occurrence of such side effects following surgery. For those reasons, we considered that the evidence supplied was insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy claims as they would be understood by consumers. Next, we assessed the NHS advice on laser eye surgery provided to substantiate claims regarding the duration of laser eye surgery. It stated that the procedure usually took between 20 and 30 minutes depending on the specific technique used. We acknowledged that laser eye surgery was typically an outpatient operation, and that patients were able to return home on the same day as the surgery. However, the advice also discussed the recovery period after surgery; for instance, it stated that patients would not be able to drive on the day of their surgery or be able to drive at night until their eyes had recovered. It also referred to several side effects which were likely to impact upon an individual’s recovery time. We therefore considered that there was a recovery period following laser eye surgery and that, while it was not a considerable length of time, recovery would not be immediate, and day-to-day activities may be impacted as a result. Because the ad implied that recovery from laser eye surgery was immediate and day-to-day activities could be resumed following surgery, when that was not the case, we considered that it was misleading. Finally, we assessed the article explaining different laser eye surgery techniques published by a well-known eye hospital. The article stated that patients did not feel pain but, rather, experienced a feeling of pressure and mild discomfort which continued for four to six hours after surgery. While we acknowledged that patients were unlikely to be in pain, we considered that patients were likely to feel a certain level of discomfort during and after the procedure. In addition, the NHS advice referenced above stated that it was commonplace to encounter a number of side effects, including dry eyes, after the procedure and, furthermore, that there was a chance of complications both during and after the operation. Because we understood that it was commonplace to experience side effects after laser eye surgery, when the ad implied that was not the case, we considered the ad gave consumers a misleading impression of the potential outcomes of laser eye surgery, including with regards to pain. Given the above, we considered that the claims “revolutionary laser eye procedure”, “Almost all patients have achieved 20/20 vision”, “it's all over in a matter of minutes”, “More effective than ever before” and “virtually painless” were misleading and had exaggerated the capability of LASIK eye surgery. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.11 (Exaggeration).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Marketing VF Ltd t/a Lasik Eyes to ensure that future marketing materials did not falsely imply they were acting for purposes outside their business, not to imply that they directly provided laser eye surgery if they did not, and to make clear that they were a referral company that received commission for their service. We also told them to ensure that future marketing materials did not misleadingly exaggerate the capability of LASIK treatment.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/marketing-vf-ltd-a24-1253881-marketing-vf-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Oakever Games PTE Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Two in-game ads for the mobile app game Zen Word, seen in August 2024: a. The first ad featured a person wearing blue medical scrubs. On-screen text stated, “What advice do you have for preventing Alzheimer’s disease in older adults? I recommend to all elderly individuals to avoid simple and boring games, as they offer no benefit to the brain. Instead, I would recommend playing a word game called Zen Word. Wait […] are you serious? Preventing Alzheimer’s disease by playing a word game? Yes, that’s right. This game can keep your brain constantly thinking, restoring youth and vitality. Although it’s quite challenging, it might be the most enjoyable way to prevent Alzheimer’s”. b. The second ad featured text on a billboard that stated, “As a neurologist, I strongly advise against simple, boring games for mental engagement, especially for seniors like my 60-year-old mother. These games don’t really help the brain. Instead, try Zen Word-the world’s toughest word game. It actively stimulates the brain, making you sharper and greatly improving your memory and sleep. Your brain will thank you! And you’ll look even younger […] I recommend everyone to play Zen Word for at least 30 minutes every day”.",The complainants challenged whether:,,"The CAP Code stated that medicinal or medical claims and indications could only be made for a medicinal product that was licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the Veterinary Medicines Regulations (VMD) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. In addition, the Medical Devices Regulations required that a medical device was registered with the MHRA before it was placed on the market in Great Britain. The ASA considered that consumers would understand ad (a) to mean that playing Zen Word could prevent Alzheimer’s disease. We therefore considered that ad made a medical claim, which required that the product met the requirements for medical devices. However, we understood that Zen Word was not registered with the MHRA, nor had we seen any evidence that the game had the applicable conformity marking. Therefore, no medical claims could be made for the product. Because the ad made such claims, we concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.10 (Legality) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). Ad (b) stated, “As a neurologist, I strongly advise against simple, boring games for mental engagement […] try Zen Word-the world’s toughest word game. It actively stimulates the brain, making you sharper and greatly improving your memory and sleep […] I recommend everyone to play Zen Word for at least 30 minutes every day”. We considered that consumers would understand the claim “greatly improving your memory and sleep” to mean that the Zen Word game was capable of improving users’ memory and sleep, if they played the game for 30 minutes daily. We further considered that the statement “As a neurologist” reinforced the impression that the app could provide a medical benefit to users. We therefore expected to see robust documentary evidence substantiating the claim that playing the Zen Word game was capable of helping people improve their memory and sleep, consisting of clinical trials conducted on people. However, we received no evidence from the advertiser to substantiate that the app could help people with their sleep and/or memory. In the absence of such evidence, we concluded that the claim had not been substantiated and was therefore misleading. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Oakever Games PTE Ltd t/a Zen Word not to make medical claims for devices that did not hold the applicable conformity marking and were not registered with the MHRA. We also told them to not make claims that their app could improve users’ memory and/or sleep unless they held adequate evidence to substantiate such claims.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/oakever-games-pte-ltd-g24-1257433-oakever-games-pte-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Origin Sleep UK Ltd t/a Origin Mattress,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website for Origin Mattress, www.originmattress.co.uk, seen in August 2024. The website included a banner at the top that included text which stated, “Mega Summer Sale up to 45% off […] ending in […]” followed by a countdown clock showing the days, hours, minutes and seconds left of the sale. A webpage, titled “SALE”, included links to the “Origin Hybrid Mattress” and the “Origin Hybrid Pro Mattress”. Text under the “Origin Hybrid Mattress” listing stated, “Up to 40% off”, under which the original price of £465 was shown with a line crossed through, followed by the sale price of £279.00. Text at the bottom of the listing for the “Origin Hybrid Pro Mattress” stated, “Up to 45% off – ENDS SOON”, under which the original price of £961.00 was shown with a line crossed through, followed by the sale price of £529. The product webpage for the “Origin Hybrid Mattress” included text that stated, “Absolute Pressure Relief […] Orthopaedic Back Support […] Designed by orthopedics [sic] and engineered for pain-free sleep – it’s time to kick that backpain for good”. Further text seen on the page stated, “the highest possible comfort and spinal alignment in any mattress” and “Offers more support in the center [sic] third of the mattress where your bodyweight is concentrated for a healthier back. Perfect for back & joint pain relief”. The product webpage for the “Origin Hybrid Pro Mattress” included the subheading “NEW & IMPROVED Revolutionary HexaGrid Plus for Deep Pressure-Relief”, under which text stated, “Three Times More Support […] Enhanced Pressure Relief […] Our proprietary technology is designed by orthopaedics and engineered for pain-free sleep.” Further text on the page stated, “Ultimate Dynamic Back Support […] Offers more support in the center [sic] third of the mattress where your bodyweight is concentrated for a healthier and stronger back”. Text under the subheading “Supported by Science” stated, “3x Greater Pressure Relief […] 2x Enhanced Back Support […] Designed to offer enhanced support where your bodyweight is concentrated to alleviate back aches”.",Emma Matratzen GmbH challenged whether the:,Origin Sleep UK Ltd did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Origin Sleep UK Ltd’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The website featured a banner along the top which stated, “Mega Summer Sale up to 45% off […] ending in” along with boxes displaying the days, hours, minutes and seconds left of the sale, which were counting down to zero. We considered consumers would therefore understand that the promotion was ending soon, and once the countdown clock reached zero, the products included in the sale would return to their usual selling price. We considered the phrase “Mega Summer Sale” reinforced the impression that the promotion was time limited.We did not receive any pricing history from Origin Mattress. However, we understood that the day after the “Mega Summer Sale” ended, the website displayed a new sale with a different name, offering the same discounts. Because consumers would expect the products included in the “Mega Summer Sale” to revert to their usual prices after the countdown ended, when in fact another sale started the next day, we considered that the promotion was not actually time limited. We further considered that the countdown clock was likely to pressurise consumers into making a swift transactional decision, including purchasing products, without giving their purchase the due consideration they normally would, because of the misleading implication that the sale would finish at the end of the time period displayed by the countdown clock. Because the ad implied that the products on sale in a time-limited promotion would revert to their usual price when the countdown ended when that was not the case, and because the countdown clock was likely to pressurise consumers into making a swift transactional decision, we concluded the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading Advertising), 8.17 and 8.17.4.e (Promotional marketing). The ad included listings for the Hybrid Pro Mattress with the struck through price of £961 followed by the advertised sale price of £529, above which text stated, “Up to 45% off – ENDS SOON”, and the Hybrid Mattress, with the struck through price of £465 followed by the advertised sale price of £279, above text which stated, “Up to 40% off”. We considered that consumers would understand from the struck through prices that the sale prices for both mattresses represented a reduction against the price at which they were usually sold at the time the ad appeared. We also considered that consumers would understand from the claims “Up to 45% off” and “Up to 40% off” that they would be able to achieve a genuine saving of up to 45% and 40% against the usual selling price of the Hybrid Pro and Hybrid mattress, respectively. We further considered that impression was reinforced by the presence of the countdown clock, which as discussed above, consumers would likely interpret to mean that the price of the mattresses would revert to the higher price once the countdown ended. Because we did not receive any pricing history for the products from Origin Mattress, we could not determine whether the referenced higher prices were the usual selling prices. However, we noted several reference and promotional prices for both mattresses seen in screenshots of their product listings over a three-month period, shared by the complainant. We noted that between 17 November 2023 and 31 January 2024 the Hybrid Pro mattress had been consistently advertised as being on sale, with the same reference and sale prices of £961 reduced to £529. During that timeframe, the Hybrid mattress had also consistently been advertised at a reduced rate, with a reference price of £499 and a sale price of £299. Throughout that timeframe, both mattresses were advertised as being available at a 45% and 40% discount as part of a series of concurrent sales (“Black Friday”, “New Year Sale”, Mid-Winter Sale”, Sleep Better Sale”). Because we had not seen evidence that the savings claims represented a genuine saving against the usual selling prices of the products, we concluded that the savings claims in the ad were misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (Prices). We considered that consumers would understand the claims “Absolute Pressure Relief”, “Orthopaedic Back Support”, “Designed by orthopedics [sic] and engineered for pain-free sleep”, “spinal alignment” and “Perfect for back & joint pain relief” to mean that the Origin Hybrid Mattress provided pressure relief to its users, offered medically-proven orthopaedic back support, had been designed by orthopaedically trained individuals, helped maintain a healthy spinal alignment during sleep, and could help people suffering with back and joint pain. We also considered that consumers would understand the claims “Enhanced Pressure Relief”, “Our proprietary technology is designed by orthopaedics and engineered for pain-free sleep”, “for a healthier and stronger back” and “Designed to offer enhanced support where your bodyweight is concentrated to alleviate back aches” to mean that the Origin Hybrid Pro Mattress offered provably high levels of pressure relief. Also, that it had been designed by orthopaedically trained individuals and could ensure pain-free sleep plus it was capable of helping to improve the health and strength of an individual’s back thus alleviating back pain. Further claims were made, which we considered were comparative in nature, and likely to be seen by consumers as comparisons against competitors in the market: “Three Times More Support”, “3x Greater Pressure Relief” and “2x Enhanced Back Support”. We therefore expected to see robust documentary evidence substantiating those various claims, consisting of clinical trials conducted on people. However, as discussed above, we did not receive evidence from Origin Mattress to substantiate any of the claims. In the absence of such evidence, we concluded that the claims had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors), and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Origin Sleep UK Ltd to ensure their ads did not mislead as to the closing date/time of promotions, or imply that discount offers were time-limited or would not be repeated if that was not the case. We also told them to ensure that future savings claims did not mislead, and to ensure they substantiated savings claims against the usual selling price of their products. We further told Origin to ensure they did not make claims about the orthopaedic and health properties of their products unless they could be fully substantiated. We referred the matter to CAP’s compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/origin-sleep-uk-ltd-a24-1253221-origin-sleep-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Person(s) unknown t/a Sereni,"The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Meta ad, seen on 2 July 2024, featured the text “Do you struggle with your child's ADHD? Meltdowns, outbursts, screaming and yelling ... You NEED to try out the Sereni Calming Vest … It uses deep pressure therapy to help: Calm Meltdowns & Outbursts, No More Hyperactivity, Reduce Impulsive Behaviour”. It also contained a video of children wearing the Sereni Calming Vest and voice-over which explained that it could help with the signs of ADHD.",The ASA challenged whether the ad made medical claims which breached the Code.,"Sereni told us their understanding was that class I low-risk medical devices, like their product, did not require certification from a notified body. This guided their advertising.","The Medical Devices Regulations 2002 required that a medical device should be registered with The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) before it was placed on the market in the UK. Further, the CAP Code (which reflected legislation) stated that medicinal or medical claims and indications may be made for a medicinal product that is licensed by the MHRA, VMD or under the auspices of the EMA, or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. The ASA understood that the claims “It uses deep pressure therapy to help: Calm Meltdowns & Outbursts”, “No More Hyperactivity”, “Reduce Impulsive Behaviour”, regarding the treatment and management of adverse symptoms of ADHD, were medical claims for the purposes of the legislation reflected in the Code. The product was therefore required to carry an applicable conformity marking. We contacted the MHRA to clarify the classification of the product. They told us that, in general, manufacturers of Class I medical devices could self-certify for the conformity marking. However, all medical devices must also be registered with the MHRA in order to be placed on the UK market. Because Sereni had not demonstrated that the calming vest had the applicable conformity marking to allow for medical claims to be made in the ad, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form.

ASA Ruling on Rehabs.uk,This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on rehab clinic referral companies. The ad was identified for investigation following complaints received from the Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT).,"The website home page www.rehabsuk.com, for Rehabs UK, seen in July 2024 included the claims “We partner with trusted, CQC registered rehab clinics, including luxury clinics, throughout the UK and abroad” and “We don't solely collaborate with rehabilitation facilities; we stand as a distinguished provider of addiction treatments. Our services range from in-home detoxification to outpatient rehabilitation, addiction therapy, online support groups, and comprehensive aftercare programmes. We lean on our expert knowledge and experience in order to find the right rehab or treatment plan for each of our clients, giving them a personalised solution and the best possible beginning to their recovery journey.”","The complainant, Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT), challenged whether the ad falsely implied that the marketer was acting for purposes outside its business and did not make clear their commercial intent.","Rehabs.uk t/a Rehabs UK stated that they had been active within addiction treatment since 2002 and they were owned by a company that was previously a Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered rehabilitation facility. They confirmed when the website was launched in 2022, that the rehabilitation facility was active but that it closed a few months later. Therefore, the wording on their website was accurate at the time the website launched. Since the closure of the rehabilitation facility, they had operated as a referral centre only, but their business had recently expanded. They now also managed admissions for one residential rehabilitation facility and one recovery retreat. They did that to support smaller independent rehabilitation centres in the UK who did not have access to large scale marketing. They also wanted to provide access to a range of treatment centres and give impartial guidance. They explained their role in making referrals was to connect individuals seeking addiction treatment with registered rehabilitation centres, clinics and healthcare professionals. They confirmed that they did not provide any direct addiction therapy or healthcare services and did not employ healthcare professionals. They stated their role was to assess individuals through an initial consultation and then refer them to CQC registered addiction treatment centres and qualified doctors. They did however provide free online support services themselves to offer guidance and support, and they had provided extensive aftercare at a cost to their organisation. Those services though did not involve clinical treatment and fell outside of the CQC regulation. They said that their website made clear they did make referrals. For instance, it stated, “We partner with trusted, CQC registered rehab clinics” and “We lean on our expert knowledge and experience in order to find the right rehab or treatment plan for each of our clients”. In addition, the website prominently stated, ""Impartial Advice for Addiction Recovery Treatment"". They believed the website therefore clearly outlined their role as a connector of clients with appropriately registered and qualified third-party services. They amended the claim “We don't solely collaborate with rehabilitation facilities; we stand as a distinguished provider of addiction treatments […]” to “We act as a distinguished connector to addiction treatment services. We assist individuals in finding the right professionals for their needs, from in-home detoxification to outpatient rehabilitation, addiction therapy, online support groups, and comprehensive aftercare programmes. Drawing on our expert knowledge and experience, we guide our clients to the most suitable rehab or treatment plan, ensuring they receive a personalised solution and the best possible start to their recovery journey"". They believed the amendment made clear their referral based business model. They explained that making referrals and receiving a fee was standard practice in the industry. That included rehabilitation centres and referral services. They said rehabilitation centres referred clients to other centres if the person’s specific addiction or needs made them unsuitable for treatment at their facility. They said most rehabilitation centres did not make that process clear on their websites. They said that the ad did not misleadingly imply they were acting for purposes outside their business or that they provided direct treatment services. However, they were willing to make further changes if that was needed.","The ASA noted that the website had stated, “We don't solely collaborate with rehabilitation facilities; we stand as a distinguished provider of addiction treatments. Our services range from in-home detoxification to outpatient rehabilitation, addiction therapy, online support groups, and comprehensive aftercare programmes.” We considered that consumers were likely to understand that claim, in conjunction with the multiple references to “treatment” on the website, such as “Confidential Addiction Recovery Treatment”, “ALCOHOL HOME DETOX TREATMENT” and “Addiction Rehab Clinics & Treatment Across the UK and Abroad”, to mean that in some circumstances Rehabs UK would provide treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated, and did not exclusively work with other services. We acknowledged that they had made a change on their website stating, “We act as a distinguished connector to addiction treatment services” and no longer stated that they were a “distinguished provider of addiction treatments” or that their “services range from in-home detoxification to outpatient rehabilitation, addiction therapy, online support groups, and comprehensive aftercare programmes”. However, we understood that Rehabs UK was a referral centre, as well as managing admissions to two specific services, that connected consumers seeking help for addiction with registered treatment providers and they received payment for doing so. While the amended website, which stated, “We act as a distinguished connector to addiction treatment services. We assist individuals in finding the right professionals for their needs […]” was clearer that they did not provide treatment directly, and they made referrals to third parties, the amended text was low down on the page. Overall, however, the website did not prominently or explicitly make clear what their business model was and how they were funded. The ad did not make immediately clear that they made referrals for which they received payment for facilitating the placements with partner rehabilitation facilities and instead implied that they also provided treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated. We therefore concluded that the ad implied that Rehabs UK were acting for purposes outside their business, and did not make clear their commercial intent. The ad therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 2.3 (Recognition of Marketing Communications).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Rehabs.uk t/a Rehabs UK to ensure that they did not falsely imply they were acting for purposes outside their business, not to imply that they provided treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated if they did not and to make clear that they were a company that received payment for their referral services.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/rehabs-uk-a24-1252129-rehabs-uk.html
ASA Ruling on Serenity Rehabilitation Ltd t/a Serenity Addiction Centres,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on rehab clinic referral companies. The ad was identified for investigation following complaints received from the Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT). Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website for Serenity Addiction Centres, www.rehabclinic.org.uk, seen on 11 July 2024. The home page contained branding and the name “Serenity Addiction Centres”. The homepage provided information about the organisation and stated, “We will beat your addiction together and give you the tools you need to achieve long-term sobriety. We have rehab clinics across the UK with rapid placements available” and “Our rehab clinics in the UK are equipped to treat all stages of addiction and all types of addiction”. Further down the page, under the headline “Our Memberships and Accreditations” was a list of logos, including for the General Medical Council, NHS Qualified Provider, Nursing & Midwifery Council and Care Quality Commission. The “London Drug & Alcohol Rehab Clinics” page had text which stated, “Our rehabilitation centres”. The page contained various sections, such as information about staff and facilities, which included the claim “All our rehab clinics have a team made up of […] BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy] accredited nurses”. Further down the page, under the headline “Make an appointment at our rehab clinics in London”, there was a list of clinics. Each clinic was listed with the headline “Serenity Addiction Centres” and Serenity’s email and phone details. That page also contained a box with the headline “FREE CONSULTATION” with the company’s contact details.","The Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT), challenged whether the:","1., 2. & 3. Serenity Rehabilitation Ltd t/a Serenity Addiction Centres said that they owned a clinic in Cyprus and had a variety of healthcare professionals working for them, which included subcontracted staff. They said that in the last two years, the website had not been fully functioning and did not appear prominently in Google searches. They said that they had also not made a referral to a rehabilitation centre in the past two years and had only organised a few home detoxes. They further said that they had made some changes to their website, and were in the process of selling the website, and they understood the buyers intended to make additional changes, following the complaint.","The ad had contained numerous references to “we” and “our” in relation to the listed rehabilitation centres and services. For example, the homepage stated “We will beat your addiction together and give you the tools you need to achieve long-term sobriety. We have rehab clinics across the UK with rapid placements available” and “Our rehab clinics in the UK are equipped to treat all stages of addiction and all types of addiction”. It further made multiple references to rehabilitation facilities, such as “Our rehabilitation centres”, “Make an appointment at our rehab clinics in London” and the name “Serenity Addiction Centres”. The ASA noted the list of clinics under the title “Make an appointment at our rehab clinics in London”, on the “London Drug & Alcohol Rehab Clinics” page, included the headline “Serenity Addiction Centres” and provided Serenity’s email and phone details for each clinic. We considered that consumers were likely to understand that Serenity Addiction Centres provided treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated. We understood however that the listed clinics were not owned or operated by Serenity Addiction Centres. Instead, they acted as a referral centre, whereby they received commission from partner clinics for the placement of individuals with those clinics. We acknowledged that Serenity Addiction Centres had made changes to their website, following the complaint, which included removing several claims that implied ownership or treatment facilities and the list of clinics on the “London Drug & Alcohol Rehab Clinics” page. However, the ad did not make clear, either in its original form or following the changes, that they were principally a referral company that received commission for facilitating placements with partner rehabilitation facilities. Instead it suggested that they provided treatments directly at clinics that they owned or operated. We concluded that the ad implied that Serenity Rehabilitation were acting for purposes outside their business and did not make clear their commercial intent. The ad therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 2.3 (Recognition of Marketing Communications). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not falsely claim that the marketer, or other entity referred to in the marketing communication, was a signatory to a code of conduct. The Code further stated that marketing communications must not claim that the marketer has been approved, endorsed or authorised by any public or other body if it has not or without complying with the terms of the approval, endorsement or authorisation. We considered that the heading “Our Memberships and Accreditations” on the homepage, followed by the logos for the General Medical Council, NHS Qualified Provider, Nursing & Midwifery Council and Care Quality Commission, were likely to be understood as claims that Serenity Addiction Centres was regulated or approved by those organisations. However, we understood that was not the case and that Serenity Addiction Centres’ nurses were not BACP (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy) members as claimed. We acknowledged that Serenity Addiction Centres had amended the ad, and had removed the “Memberships and Accreditations” section and reference to the BACP accreditation for their nurses. Nevertheless, for the reasons given, we concluded that the ad as it originally appeared breached the Code. On those points, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.50 and 3.51 (Endorsements and testimonials).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on UK Addiction Treatment Ltd t/a UKAT,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on rehab clinic referral companies. The ad was identified for investigation following complaints received from the Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT). Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A website www.uk-rehab.com, for UK Addiction Treatment Ltd, seen on 11 July 2024. The home page contained information about services provided by the organisation, which included the claims “FREE Advice including NHS & Private Options” and “Access to Hundreds of Drug and Alcohol Rehab Centres”. At the bottom of the page was a contact form, with a headline that stated, “Our trained addiction counsellors are on hand 24 hours a day”. The “About Us” page referred to the organisation as “UK Rehab helper”. Further down the page, in the ""Finding the right clinic"" subsection, the ad included the claim, “UK Rehab Helper has no bias for one rehab clinic over another – we help individuals find the best possible treatment for their needs” and “UK Rehab Helper will look at your budget and work with you to find the best UK rehab clinics possible”.","The complainant, Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT), challenged whether:","1. UK Addiction Treatment Ltd (UKAT) t/a UK Rehab said that their business was primarily the operation of eight CQC-regulated facilities. They stated the UK Rehab website was a legacy website directory for information purposes only, and did not generate profit. They explained that it was a directory containing resources for enquirers and had not been updated for many years, as it was no longer relevant to UKAT’s core business, providing treatment in rehabilitation centres. They said the website homepage contained a question mark which when clicked on explained that an enquirer would be contacting UKAT, upon providing their details to UK Rehab.They said UK Rehab signposted users to support and clinical care, helping enquirers to access free services including national government-funded services and 12-step meetings. If the enquirer required clinical care at a rehabilitation centre and was suitable for one of UKAT's treatment centres, they were referred to one of their facilities. However, when a patient was not suitable for their centres, they were referred to the appropriate service for their needs, including alternative rehabs, hospitals, mental health facilities as well as free options. UK Rehab said they did not receive any income from those referrals. They said following notice of the complaint, they had updated the wording on their website. “Access to Hundreds of Drug and Alcohol Rehab Centres”, had been changed to ""Directory of drug and alcohol rehab centres”, and “UK Rehab Helper will look at your budget and work with you to find the best UK rehab clinics possible” had been changed to ""our trained addiction specialists will help you find the ideal rehab programme that fits your budget"". They had also amended the general use of the name “UK Rehab Helper” to ""UK Rehab"". They had also added the wording ""Part of UK Addiction Treatment Centres"" to the footer of their website. 2. UK Rehab highlighted that there was no legal definition of the term counsellor or an obligation to register with a regulatory body before using the term. They said that in the context of their ad, ""counselling,"" as defined by most dictionaries, involved listening and offering advice. They said that when an enquiry came in, they provided guidance on matters related to family dynamics, boundaries, treatment options, and potential consequences. They clarified that did not equate to psychotherapy sessions and that enquirers who required in-depth therapeutic sessions were referred to a therapist, who could provide structured weekly sessions tailored to the individual's needs. They said their counselling provided immediate emotional support, directive advice, and basic assistance. They said all individuals who provided their callback service had undergone thorough training by UKAT and were equipped to deliver the highest quality of services to enquirers. They provided a breakdown of their training structure and guidance for phone operatives. They said new employees typically underwent a training period of three to six months and the training included face-to-face sessions with role-playing exercises. They stated that the aim of their phone staff was to encourage enquirers to begin their recovery process promptly. They said that when an enquiry was received, a qualified staff member who understood the enquirer’s situation would offer appropriate guidance and an initial consultation which involved an assessment of the enquirer's challenges, a discussion of potential therapies and general support to motivate the individual. They would also conduct further calls to follow up and ensure the enquirer had connected with a suitable program, if appropriate. They also highlighted the experience in their team and provided a breakdown of seven staff members and their experience in the addiction and rehabilitation industry. However, to avoid ambiguity, they had updated their website and removed one reference to counsellors and replaced another with ""addiction specialists"".","The ASA considered that consumers were likely to understand from the claims “FREE Advice including NHS & Private Options”, “Access to Hundreds of Drug and Alcohol Rehab Centres”, “UK Rehab Helper has no bias for one rehab clinic over another – we help individuals find the best possible treatment for their needs” and “UK Rehab Helper will look at your budget and work with you to find the best UK rehab clinics possible”, that UK Rehab was an impartial directory, unaffiliated with any one particular treatment provider and that they did not give primary consideration to any particular provider in the referral processWe noted that the website contained text, which stated, “Who am I contacting? Calls and contact requests are answered by admissions at UK Addiction Treatment Group. We look forward to helping you take your first step”. However, it was not immediately clear to consumers because a yellow question mark, near the bottom of the page, had to be clicked for that text to be displayed. Furthermore, that statement did not explain that the Rehab Guide website was owned by and part of UKAT who were a treatment provider. We acknowledged that Rehab Guide had made amendments to their website, including changing the references “UK Rehab Helper” to ""UK Rehab"" and adding the statement ""Part of UK Addiction Treatment Centres"" to the footer of their website. While the footer was clearer that the website was part of UKAT, we considered it did not change the overall impression of the ad, that UK Rehab was an impartial directory, and did not prominently or explicitly make clear, without contradiction, that the advice would preferentially suggest UKAT facilities for those who could pay for treatment, or that UK Rehab was part of UKAT. The ad did not make clear that UK Rehab was principally a referral service for UKAT facilities and that it was part of UKAT, and instead suggested they offered an impartial service. We therefore concluded that because the ad implied they were acting for purposes outside their business, and did not make clear their commercial intent, it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 2.3 (Recognition of Marketing Communications) We understood that “counsellor” was not a protected title and, as such, those using the term did not need to be professionally registered. However, we considered that consumers were likely to understand the “Our trained addiction counsellors are on hand 24 hours a day”, especially in the context of an addiction rehabilitation website, to mean that the phone staff could offer professional therapeutic counselling over the phone and that they had a level of external qualification that enabled them to conduct specific addiction counselling. We understood that was not the case from UK Rehab’s description of their internal training programme. We welcomed UK Rehab’s decision to remove the references to counsellors from their website. However, we considered that consumers were also likely to interpret the term ""addiction specialists"" to mean the call staff would be able to provide a more thorough and specific level of addiction support on the phone than we understood to be the case. We concluded that the claim “Our trained addiction counsellors are on hand 24 hours a day” was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading Advertising).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told UK Addiction Treatment Ltd t/a UK Rehab to ensure that their advertising did not falsely imply they were acting for purposes outside their business, not to imply their service was impartial if that was not the case and to avoid claims implying that they offered professional counselling or specialist treatment over the phone, unless they could demonstrate that was the case.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/uk-addiction-treatment-ltd-a24-1252013-uk-addiction-treatment-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Valterous Ltd t/a Therapie Clinic,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for a beauty clinic, Therapie Clinic UK, seen on 8 July 2024, stated in the caption “Cosmetic Injections […] 200+ Doctors on Our Team 10 Million + Treatments Completed”. The ad included a photo of a woman’s face. Text next to the image text stated, “DOCTOR-LED TREATMENTS COSMETIC INJECTIONS 3 AREAS”. Text along the bottom of the image stated, “Cosmetic Injections, Dermal Filler, Lip Filler”. Additional text stated, “Doctor Led Cosmetic Injections Therapie Clinic is Europe’s No.1 medical aesthetic clinic … Learn more”.","The ASA received complaints from the Joint Council for Cosmetic Practitioners (JCP) and Laser Clinics UK. They challenged whether the ads promoted Botox, and therefore breached the Code by advertising a prescription-only medicine (POM) to the public.","Valterous Ltd t/a Therapie Clinic UK said that all their cosmetic injectable treatments were categorised as ""Doctor-Led Treatments"" and were administered exclusively by qualified healthcare professionals. Those treatments included non-prescription only medicine treatments including dermal fillers, lip fillers, polynucleotides, Profhilo, HArmonyCA and Sunekos, as well as prescription-only medicine treatments that used ‘Toxin’ (Botulinum toxin), all of which were prescribed and administered in strict accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. They said that ""3 Areas"" referred to treatment zones commonly targeted for aesthetic improvements, such as: lips, jaw, nasolabial folds, marionette lines, cheeks, chin, tear troughs and temples for fillers; face, neck and hand areas for polynucleotides and Profhilo; eye and face areas for Sunekos; and the face for HArmonyCA. ""Cosmetic Injections"" encompassed a broad range of treatments, including dermal fillers, lip fillers, polynucleotides, Profhilo, HArmonyCA, Sunekos and Botulinum toxin, administered in precise doses to the areas described above, based on individual client needs.","The CAP Code stated that POMs or prescription-only medical treatments may not be advertised to the public. The ASA understood from the Therapie Clinic website that they offered a number of ""Cosmetic Injections"" treatments, which included polynucleotides, Profhilo, HArmonyCA and Sunekos, as well as “Anti-Wrinkle” treatments. They also offered “Fillers” which included dermal fillers and lip fillers. We further understood from the FAQ section on their website that anti-wrinkle injections were “also known as botulinum toxin injections”. Whilst polynucleotides, Profhilo, HArmonyCA, Sunekos, dermal filler and lip filler were non-POM treatments, botulinum toxin (Botox) was a POM. The ad stated, “COSMETIC INJECTIONS 3 AREAS FROM £179 […] Cosmetic Injections Dermal Filler Lip Filler”. We considered that consumers would understand from the ad that cosmetic injections were distinct from dermal fillers and lip fillers. As referenced above, whilst “Cosmetic Injections” referred to both POM and non-POM treatments, we understood that the promotion only applied to “Anti-Wrinkle” treatments, and not the polynucleotides, Profhilo, Sunekos, HarmonyCA or filler treatments that they offered. We therefore considered that the claim “COSMETIC INJECTIONS 3 AREAS FROM £179” referred to their “Anti-Wrinkle” treatments and, because that was a reference to botulinum toxin injections, the ad indirectly advertised a POM, namely Botox. We therefore concluded that the ad advertised a POM to the general public. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Valterous Ltd t/a Therapie Clinic UK not to advertise prescription-only medicines to the public in the future.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/valterous-ltd-g24-1253503-valterous-ltd.html

They believed sublingual vitamin B12 was a safe and effective alternative for individuals with general vitamin B12 deficiency and provided a study to support that claim. They did not promote the product as an alternative to seeking medical advice and believed that those who had a clinical vitamin B12 deficiency should speak to healthcare professionals before they decided to stop taking any prescribed medicines. 3. Vivo Life said the claims “My mood’s a lot better” and “I’ve got energy to get up and do stuff” were genuine customer testimonials and not direct claims about the product’s capabilities. The claims reflected the personal experiences of customers, who had described their improved mood and energy levels after using the product. They acknowledged the claims that made reference to energy, psychological function and fatigue did not match the precise wording of the authorised health claims on the GB Register. The claims instead expressed the health benefits of the product in everyday language. They believed that, despite the wording of the claims in the ads not being exact, they were still consistent with the relevant claims on the GB Register. For example, they believed the ads reflected the authorised claims that “Vitamin B12 contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism” and “Vitamin B12 contributes to normal functioning of the nervous system”. Vivo Life said they would make it explicitly clear to the influencers they worked with that all claims they made must be compliant with the CAP Code. They also said they would review all their ads and remove any which implied that customers should stop taking medically prescribed vitamin B12 injections.","The CAP Code required that ads for foods, including food supplements, must not claim to treat clinical vitamin deficiencies or state or imply that a food or food supplement could prevent, treat or cure human disease. The ASA considered the claims “my mood’s a lot better” and “my energy’s better” in ad (a), and “I feel I’ve got energy to get up and do stuff” and “Finally a supplement that actually works on my tiredness” in ad (b) would have been interpreted by consumers to mean that the Vivo Life Vitamin B12 droplets product was effective at treating the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency. We further considered the claims “If you get vitamin B12 injections you need to fuck them off and get these” in ad (a) and “this supplement of B12 that is just as effective as having a B12 injection” in ad (b) implied the product could treat a vitamin B12 deficiency. The ads therefore made claims that a food supplement could treat a clinical vitamin deficiency and one or more of its symptoms. We then assessed whether the ads irresponsibly encouraged consumers to stop taking medically prescribed vitamin B12 injections. We considered that the claims “I don’t need to go anywhere else to get my injection” in ad (a) and “this supplement of B12 that is just as effective as having a B12 injection” in ad (b) implied the product was equivalent to medicines which were prescribed to treat that deficiency. We considered that in making those claims the ad suggested consumers could take the advertised supplement instead of their medically prescribed vitamin B12 injections. We therefore considered the claims were irresponsible. Both ads claimed that a food supplement could treat a clinical vitamin deficiency and one or more of its symptoms, and irresponsibly encouraged consumers to stop taking medically prescribed vitamin B12 injections. We therefore concluded they had breached the Code. On those points, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.9 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the GB Register were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. Health claims were claims that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health. Any authorised health claims made in an ad must meet the associated conditions of use. We considered the claims “my mood’s a lot better” and “my energy’s better” in ad (a), and the claim “I’ve got energy to get up and do stuff” in ad (b), to be specific health claims that the product could help to regulate mood and improve energy levels, respectively. However, there were no authorised health claims relating to B12 improving mood and energy levels on the GB Register. The claims “Vitamin B12 contributes to normal psychological function” and “Vitamin B12 contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism” were authorised on the GB Register. We acknowledged Vivo Life’s comments that the claims in both ads simply expressed the health benefits of the product in everyday language. However, health claims must be presented clearly and without exaggeration. Marketers could exercise some flexibility in rewording a claim, provided that the reworded claim was likely to have the same meaning for consumers as the authorised health claim. The aim of the rewording was to aid consumer understanding while taking into account factors such as linguistic and cultural variations and the target population. We considered the phrasing “contributes to” in the authorised claims was important in conveying their full meaning. It made clear that the vitamin named in the claims was only one of a number of nutrients that were involved in providing the stated beneficial physiological effect. We also considered that in the absence of the wording “contributes to”, consumers were likely to interpret the claims “my energy’s better” and “I’ve got energy to get up and do stuff” as absolute, and so we considered the claims exaggerated the meaning of the authorised health claims. We therefore considered the claims “my energy’s better” in ad (a) and the claim “I’ve got energy to get up and do stuff” in ad (b) in relation to vitamin B12 had breached the Code. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1, and 15.7 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Vivostore Ltd t/a Vivo Life not to state a food supplement could treat clinical vitamin B12 deficiency or its symptoms, nor to irresponsibly encourage consumers to stop taking medically prescribed vitamin B12 injections. We also told them not to make specific health claims about vitamin B12 unless they were authorised on the GB Register.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/vivostore-ltd-a24-1253730-vivostore-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Which Rehab Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on rehab clinic referral companies. The ad was identified for investigation following complaints received from the Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT). Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","The website homepage www.whichrehab.co.uk, for Which Rehab, seen in July 2024, stated: “Drug and Alcohol Rehab London & UK I Free, Impartial, Expert Addiction Rehab & Treatment Advice”; “WHICHREHAB? HELPING YOU ACCESS THE RIGHT ADDICTION TREATMENT”; “Call Our Free 24-Hour Addiction Treatment Helpline”, “Our addiction treatments are designed to treat you as a whole person”, “Our rehab success stories”; “Our addiction treatment service covers the whole of the UK”; “Drug & Alcohol Rehab & Detox Treatment Wherever You Are. Our networks of rehabs and contacts in our rehab directory means [sic] we have the appropriate addiction rehab clinic near you, for you”; and “Which Rehab not only provide free advice…but also a number of proven addiction treatment services…We also effectively treat all manner of drug addictions, behavioural problems and mental health issues that are commonly linked to addiction.” The page showed the logos of seven major insurers and stated, “We accept most UK insurers for drug & alcohol rehab treatment”. The page further showed the “Regulated by the Care Quality Commission” logo and stated, “Which Rehab only work with and recommend rehabs that have been approved by the Care Quality Commission (CQC)”.","The complainant, Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment (EMCAT) challenged whether the:","1. Which Rehab Ltd said their website had never stated that they operated any clinics, and any misunderstanding in that respect would have been clarified when a consumer called their helpline. However, they acknowledged the wording on the website could have been more precise. They said that they did provide free and impartial advice to those who contacted them. Callers were then signposted to treatment providers who were best suited to their individual needs. This would take into account the consumer’s location, affordability, preference of length of stay at a rehabilitation facility, as well as other factors. Dependent on circumstances and preferences the consumer could be referred to a suitable private, not-for-profit or charity run service. They explained if the consumer was referred to a private service and they completed the pre-admission assessment and paid for treatment, Which Rehab would receive a referral fee. If an individual was signposted to a not-for-profit or charity run service no referral fee would be received. They explained that they had decided to review the website to ensure consistency and made changes to avoid any misunderstandings. 2. Which Rehab said that many consumers were concerned about the future potential costs of treatment. Therefore, they wanted to reassure those visiting their website that the treatment centres to which they referred accepted most UK insurers, and as such, they listed those companies on the page. They acknowledged however that the claim “We accept most UK insurers for drug & alcohol rehab treatment” could imply that they worked directly with the insurers. They said it would have been clear to consumers who called them that all insurance agreements were with the treatment centres themselves. However, they had amended the claim to make that clearer. 3. Which Rehab stated that they contacted the CQC in 2021 to request permission to use their logo. They were told by the CQC that they could display it as long as they made clear why it was on the website and that they were explicit that they only recommended CQC registered services. On that basis, the logo was shown on the website with text that stated, “Therefore, Which Rehab only work with and recommend rehabs that have been approved by the Care Quality Commission (CQC)… Our rehabs are all regulated by CQC… To find out more about how our CQC approved rehabs can help you…”. They confirmed that Which Rehab was not regulated by the CQC and believed that they had not presented themselves as such. However, they had made amendments to the text since the complaint and amended “Our rehabs” in the text that accompanied the CQC logo to say, “Our recommended rehabs” and removed the word “our” before “CQC approved rehabs”.","The ASA noted that the home page had stated, “Which Rehab not only provide free advice…but also a number of proven addiction treatment services…We also effectively treat all manner of drug addictions, behavioural problems and mental health issues that are commonly linked to addiction”. Further it had said, “Our Addiction Treatment Services”, “Our rehab success stories” and “Our addiction treatment service covers the whole of the UK”. We considered those claims were likely to be understood by consumers to mean that Which Rehab provided treatment directly at centres they owned or operated. In addition, the page also had said “Free, Impartial, Expert Addiction Rehab & Treatment Advice” and “Which Rehab?” and therefore implied that they offered impartial advice with no commercial incentive. However, we understood that Which Rehab was a referral centre that connected consumers seeking help for addiction with registered treatment providers and they received commission for doing so. We acknowledged that Which Rehab had made changes to their home page and wider website. The updated home page made clearer that they did not provide treatment directly and made referrals to third parties. However, the changes made were quite low down the page and therefore the home page still did not prominently or explicitly make clear what their business model was and how they were funded. The ad did not make immediately clear that they were principally a referral company that received commission for placements with partner rehabilitation facilities, and instead implied they provided treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated, as well as offering unbiased advice to those seeking help with addiction. We therefore concluded that the ad implied that Which Rehab were acting for purposes outside their business, and did not make clear their commercial intent. The ad therefore breached the Code. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 2.3 (Recognition of Marketing Communications). The home page had displayed the logos of seven major insurers and stated, “We accept most UK insurers for drug & alcohol rehab treatment”. We considered that consumers were likely to interpret the claim, particularly because of the use of “We”, to mean that Which Rehab directly accepted payment via claims made with the specific insurers listed on the website. However, as a referrer, not a treatment centre, Which Rehab did not engage with the insurers directly. We acknowledged that Which Rehab had made changes to the home page and it now stated, “The treatment providers that we refer to accept most UK insurers for drug & alcohol rehab treatment” just above the logos of the insurers. It therefore made clearer that the insurers would be accepted by the addiction centres themselves, rather than via Which Rehab. However, because the home page previously implied a direct arrangement that did not exist with those insurers, we concluded the ad at the time of the complaint was misleading. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading Advertising). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not claim that the marketer has been approved, endorsed or authorised by any public or other body if it has not or without complying with the terms of the approval, endorsement or authorisation. In addition, marketing communications must not falsely claim that the marketer, or other entity referred to in the marketing communication, is a signatory to a code of conduct. The home page had displayed the CQC name and logo with the text “Regulated by”. We considered that consumers were likely to interpret the claim “Regulated by Care Quality Commission” with the CQC logo as meaning Which Rehab itself was regulated by the CQC. We acknowledged that changes had been made to the home page regarding the use and positioning of the logo to make clearer, as the CQC had requested, that it was the rehab services that were CQC registered that Which Rehab recommended,.However, because the home page previously implied that Which Rehab were regulated by the CQC, rather than the services they recommended, we concluded the ad had breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.50 and 3.51 (Endorsements and testimonials).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Which Rehab Ltd to ensure that their advertising did not falsely imply they were acting for purposes outside their business, not to imply that they provided treatment directly at clinics that they owned or operated if they did not and to make clear that they were a referral company that received commission for their service. They must not imply a direct relationship with insurers if that was not the case and must not claim that they had been approved or authorised by any public or other body if that was not the case.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/which-rehab-ltd-a24-1252126-which-rehab-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Alchemy Bros Ltd t/a Energy Grant Access,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on home efficiency scheme grants, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 11 December 2024. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Meta ad for Energy Grant Access, published on 13 June 2024 included text that stated, “Homeowners in Scotland heating their homes with oil, electric, solid fuel or LPG, can get free solar panels with this government-backed scheme. You might also be eligible for other renewable heating and home insulation”. The ad included an image that displayed a coat of arms, the national flag of Scotland (the Saltire), and text that stated, “ECO4 is a Government energy-efficiency scheme in partnership with [Ofgem logo]”. Further text stated, “Is Your Property Off-Gas? Get a Free Heat Pump This government-backed scheme provides up to £45,000 in free home energy upgrades” and included a button labelled “Check My Eligibility”. Text underneath stated, “100% Free Heat Pump Instantly check your eligibility for a free heat pump under this government-backed grant” and a button labelled “Apply Now”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad:,"1. Alchemy Bros Ltd t/a Energy Grant Access stated that the logo used in the ad was their coat of arms that was intended to evoke a sense of “Britishness”, security and accessibility through use of the symbols of lions, keys and a shield. They did not intend it to imply any official endorsement or affiliation with any government body or official entity. Regarding the use of the national flag of Scotland (the Saltire), they stated that, although the Scottish government did include the blue and white Saltire in its logo, the flag was always accompanied by the text “Scottish Government – Riaghaltas na h-Alba” or “gov.scot”, and therefore they did not consider that their ad implied that they were endorsed by the Scottish government. They used the Saltire in their ad to denote their target audience, which was Scottish homeowners and tenants. Their intent was to communicate that the service they provided was specifically targeted at residents of Scotland. They included the Ofgem logo to communicate that the ECO4 scheme was a government initiative in partnership with Ofgem, and to provide reassurance that the funding was genuine and regulated by a reputable organisation, and not to imply any endorsement of Energy Grant Access’ specific services by Ofgem. They acknowledged that their use of the Ofgem logo may lead consumers to believe that their company was endorsed by or affiliated with Ofgem. They said they would amend the ad. 2. They acknowledged the importance of transparency in all their communications. They said that the commercial intent behind Energy Grant Access was to provide a comprehensive and consultative service that assisted homeowners in navigating the complex process of accessing energy efficiency grants. They actively engaged with homeowners to assess their eligibility, provide tailored advice, and ensure that they understood the various grant options available to them. They made informed decisions about the likelihood of eligibility based on each customer’s property, financial situation and specific needs. Only after this consultative process, did they connect homeowners with a select group of vetted installers. They said that their operations were far removed from mere commercial lead generation, focusing instead on providing a valuable, transparent and customer-centric service.","The ASA considered that Energy Grant Access’ logo, which appeared in their profile logo and the ad, and featured two lions standing either side of a shield with a crown atop, resembled the UK’s Coat of Arms that was used by the Government. We considered that the use of the Coat of Arms alongside the name “Energy Grant Access”, the Saltire flag and the references “ECO4 is a Government energy-efficiency scheme in partnership with ofgem” and “government-backed scheme”, gave the overall impression that Energy Grant Access was associated with, or endorsed by the Scottish Government. We understood that at the time the ad was seen, there was a government-endorsed home energy efficiency scheme available, but that Energy Grant Access was not specifically associated with or endorsed by the Scottish Government in any way. Because the ad gave the overall impression that Energy Grant Access was associated with, or endorsed by the Scottish Government, when that was not the case, we concluded that the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.50 (Endorsements and Testimonials). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not falsely clam or imply that the marketer was acting for purposes outside its trade, business, craft or profession and should make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. We considered that consumers would understand from the company trading name “Energy Grant Access” and their logo, which, as referenced at point 1, resembled the UK’s Coat of Arms, that they were a government-endorsed public entity. They would further understand from the ad that Energy Grant Access would assess consumers’ eligibility for free home energy upgrades. We understood that they did assess consumer’s eligibility and that, in circumstances where consumers were eligible for the scheme, they referred them to the installers they worked with who were able to obtain the government funding. However, we understood that Energy Grant Access was a commercial enterprise. Therefore, because the overall impression of the ad was that Energy Grant Access was a government-endorsed public entity, and that was not the case, we concluded that they misleadingly implied they were acting for purposes outside of their profession and did not make their commercial intent clear.

ASA Ruling on ECO4U LTD,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on home efficiency scheme grants, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 11 December 2024. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Four paid-for Facebook ads for Citizens Energy Advice, published on 18 June 2024: a.

ECO4U LTD t/a Citizens Energy Advice said that they did not intend for their ads to be misleading. Their services were not directly approved, endorsed or authorised by the UK Government. They provided consumers with information and support related to energy efficiency and eco-friendly initiatives, which were in line with government goals. They would review their ads to ensure that distinction was always clear. 2. They said that their business worked in partnership with certified installers to facilitate the installation of eco-friendly improvements. They helped homeowners understand and access energy efficiency grants and installations. They were not installers themselves and did not work exclusively for a single company. Instead they connected customers to a network of trusted installers to ensure that they received the best service. They said that they had now removed all the ads that were the subject of this investigation.","The ASA considered that the use of the UK Government logo, which featured the UK’s Coat of Arms, alongside “HM Government” in ad (a), and the use of a previous version of the crown logo used by GOV.UK, and “GOV.UK” in all of the ads, would be interpreted by consumers to mean that Citizens Energy Advice was associated with or endorsed by the UK Government. We further considered that the name, “Citizens Energy Advice”, which closely resembled Citizens Advice, an organisation which was part-funded by the government, added to that impression. We understood that at the time the ads were seen there was a government-endorsed home energy efficiency scheme available, but that Citizens Energy Advice was not specifically associated with or endorsed by the government in any way. Because the ads gave the impression that Citizens Energy Advice was associated with or endorsed by the UK Government, when that was not the case, we concluded that the ads were misleading.

We considered that consumers would understand from the company trading name “Citizens Energy Advice” which, as referenced at point 1, closely resembled Citizens Advice, alongside the government associated logos and wording, that the ads were from a government-endorsed public entity, rather than a business. We considered that consumers would understand from the ads that Citizens Energy Advice would assess consumers’ eligibility to receive a home efficiency grant, and if eligible, consumers would be able to claim the grant through them. However, we understood that the purpose of the ads was to gain interest from customers and then pass on their contact details to the installers that they worked with. Because they did not make clear that they were primarily a lead generating business that provided consumers’ contact details to installers, and instead implied that they were offering grants for energy upgrades, we concluded that they misleadingly implied that they were acting for purposes outside of their profession and breached the Code.

ASA Ruling on Guangzhou Shimo Culture Media Co Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An in-game ad for the mobile app game Surprise Onet – Match Game, seen in the mobile app games Candy Crush Soda Edition and The Walking Dead No Man’s Land, in September 2024 featured an animated image of a female character wearing a t-shirt and hot pants-style shorts sitting with her legs spread open facing the camera, with her hand placed on her crotch. The space between her legs was partially covered by tiles with animated images on them, and an on-screen hand was tapping one of the tiles. Text stated, “Find them all and unlock the full picture”.","The complainants, who believed that the ad was sexualised and objectified women, challenged whether the ad:","1. & 2. Guangzhou Shimo Culture Media Co Ltd t/a Surprise Onet – Match Game did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. King, the developer of the game “Candy Crush Soda Edition”, said the ad appeared in their game through a third-party advertising network. They had protections in place that, among other restrictions, required all adult and explicit ads to be blocked from appearing in their games. They were reliant on ad networks and advertisers correctly identifying their content, as it was not possible, or industry practice to review every ad. They understood that occasionally ads got miscategorised by ad networks or bad actors and got past those blocks, but they tried to report and block problematic ads to ensure that ads were served in the right way. They took action to block not only the current ad, but all ads for the advertiser’s product from advertising in their games. They were not aware of any other complaints made directly to them about the ad. Deca, the developer of the game “The Walking Dead No Man’s Land”, said that on receiving notification of the complaint they conducted an internal review and took immediate action to block the advertiser. They said the ad was managed and selected by Unity Technologies (Unity Ads) who were an independent third-party provider. They said they did not select or approve individual ads displayed within the game, but they had set general preferences, such as blocking certain categories of ads, and sexually explicit content should be prohibited by default. They had also contacted the ad network Unity Ads to emphasise the importance of ensuring that all ads complied with the CAP Code requirements, particularly concerning social responsibility and harm and offence. They also requested that Unity Ads review their processes to prevent similar ads appearing in future. They had not received any direct complaints from viewers regarding the ad. Unity Ads, the ad network which served the ad seen in “The Walking Dead No Man’s Land” game provided information on their terms of service, content policy restrictions and moderation process. They said ad content was ultimately the responsibility of each advertiser, and respective publisher, however for additional protection, they voluntarily applied their own moderation process to ads uploaded to their network. They had reviewed the moderation decision in light of the ASA investigation and blocked the ad from their platform. They were further reviewing their moderation systems and processes as they related to sexualised content and harmful gender stereotypes.Apple said they had alerted their app review team to investigate the app for compliance with their App Review Guidelines. If the investigation indicated a breach of those guidelines (which included prohibitions against content that may not be age appropriate for the app’s rating), they would work with the app to address the concern.","The ASA was concerned by Guangzhou Shimo Culture Media Co Ltd’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The ad featured an image of an animated female character facing the camera wearing hot pants-style shorts and a cropped t-shirt. The character’s hair was tousled over her face and her mouth was open in a sexually suggestive way. She was sitting on the ground, leant back with her legs parted open facing the camera. Although tiles with animated images of lampshades, American footballs and timers partially covered the space between her legs, one of her hands could be seen placed on her crotch. We considered that the way she was depicted, including her clothing, facial expression and pose, which alluded to masturbation, was overtly sexual in nature and likely to cause serious offence. The ad showed an on-screen hand selecting a tile with text which stated, “Find them all and unlock the full picture” implying that removing the tiles would reveal more of the lower part of the female characters body, which was the focus of the image. We considered that portraying the female character in that way, for no other reason than to promote an online game, objectified her by presenting her as a sexual object with the sole purpose of titillating viewers.Because we considered the ad was objectifying and overtly sexual, we further considered it was likely to cause serious and widespread offence and included a gender stereotype in a way that was likely to cause harm. We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence). We considered that, because the ad was objectifying and irresponsible and likely to cause serious or widespread offence, it was not suitable to be featured in any game, regardless of whether the advertiser had taken steps to target it away from specific audiences.We understood that the advertised game “Surprise Onet – Match Game” included gameplay similar to that depicted in the ad and had an age rating of 17+. The ad, which was played on an iPhone was seen in the Candy Crush Soda Edition game which was rated aged 4+ in the Apply App Store. Notwithstanding the above, we therefore expected Guangzhou Shimo Culture Media Co to have targeted any ad for the game responsibly, including limiting the audience to users aged 18 years and over. This should have been achieved using age verification measures including interest-based targeting factors that described an adult audience and excluded a child audience. We considered that consumers playing Candy Crush would not expect to be served an ad for a game which featured adult sexual content. Because the advertiser had not provided us with evidence that they had taken appropriate action to minimise the risk of under-18s being served the ad, we concluded that the ad had been irresponsibly targeted. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Guangzhou Shimo Culture Media Co Ltd t/a Surprise Onet – Match Game to ensure their ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious or widespread offence, including by objectifying and sexualising women and featuring a harmful gender stereotype. We also told them to ensure that their ads were responsibly targeted. We referred the matter to CAP's Compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/guangzhou-shimo-culture-media-co-ltd-g24-1262172-guangzhou-shimo-culture-media-co-ltd.html

Two of their directors were fully accredited retrofit assessors and domestic energy assessors, who completed the initial in-person retrofit surveys for customers who responded to their ads to ascertain what energy efficiency measures their home qualified for and then arranged subsequent installations for the customer. They provided certificates to demonstrate those qualifications. The Energy Company Obligation was divided into two sections in terms of customer qualification; either they received at least one of the qualifying benefits, or they were referred through the Local Authority Flexibility Scheme. The installers Ignite Sustainable Energy worked with were fully approved installers in all of the council areas that they targeted with their adverts. They collected all the qualifying evidence on initial survey for the Local Authority Flexibility Scheme and, either sent it to the council on behalf of the installer, or the installer sent it to the council themselves. They provided a list of the councils they had direct relationships with. They did not claim to be endorsed or affiliated with the UK Government. They used the Energy Company Obligation logo in their ads as this was the only scheme that they worked in, and it enabled potential customers to search for and find out more information about the scheme.","The ASA considered that the use of the logo which featured “GOV.UK”, a previous version of the crown logo used by GOV.UK and “Energy Company Obligation (ECO) in Partnership with ofgem”, in both ads would be interpreted by consumers to mean that Ignite Sustainable Energy was associated with or endorsed by the UK Government. We further considered that the presentation of ad (a), such as the fonts and graphics used, were similar to those used on UK government department websites and social media accounts, and therefore added to that impression. We understood that at the time the ads were seen there was a government-endorsed home energy efficiency scheme available, but that Ignite Sustainable Energy was not specifically associated with or endorsed by the UK Government in any way.Because the ads gave the impression that Ignite Sustainable Energy was associated with or endorsed by the UK Government, when that was not the case, we concluded that the ads were misleading.

They believed that it helped to convey the legitimacy and official support behind the scheme. They also said that many of their competitors also used the logo in their ads for the same grant, which reinforced their belief that this practice was acceptable.

ASA Ruling on Jaded London Ltd,,"An Instagram post by Jaded London, a clothing retailer, seen on 29 September 2024, featured two images. The first image featured a nude woman wearing a motorbike helmet and boots. She was placed between two motorbike wheels and was holding the front wheel, while her feet were on the back wheel. The second image featured a woman wearing a motorbike helmet, boots and a faux fur coat that was raised to expose her bottom. She was placed between two motorbike wheels and was holding the front wheel, while her feet were on the back wheel. A caption on the post stated “Introducing our newest collaboration with @newrock. 4 styles. Hand crafted in Spain. Launching 3rd October. Stay tuned”.","The complainant, who believed that the images objectified and sexualised women, challenged whether the ad was offensive and promoted a harmful gender stereotype.","Jaded London Ltd believed that the ad did not objectify or sexualise women. They said the purpose of the ad was to celebrate the strength of the female form and had received positive feedback from their customers, who they believed were predominately female. They said they wanted to ensure their customers felt respected.","The CAP Code stated that ads must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, must not cause serious or widespread offence and must not include gender stereotypes that were likely to cause harm. The women were seen holding the front wheels of a motorbike while their legs were on the back wheels, which meant that their bodies and arms were stretched out in a horizontal position. That gave the impression that they formed the main component of a bike. The ASA considered this suggested they should be viewed as parts of machinery and as objects, rather than as people. Both women were wearing motorbike helmets, meaning their faces were not visible. We considered obscuring the women’s faces made their bodies the focus of the ad and further presented them as objects. The women’s bodies were positioned so their buttocks were in the place of the motorbike seat and both women’s legs were bent at the knees. That had the effect of raising their buttocks in a manner which would have been understood as being sexually suggestive, as well as being a central focus of the ad. The woman’s body in the first image was entirely naked, meaning her breasts and buttocks were exposed, which added to that sexual impression. The woman in the second image was wearing a faux fur coat. However, the coat was raised, which exposed both her legs and her buttocks and made them the focus of the image. We acknowledged that the raised coat could have been interpreted as a reference to a motorbike moving at speed as the wind blew the coat upwards. However, we considered exposing her buttocks in that manner gave the image a voyeuristic feel. We considered that by presenting the women as motorbikes, in conjunction with the nudity and sexually suggestive position in which their bodies were posed, the images featured the harmful gender stereotype that women were sexual objects. Although the ad promoted a shoe brand, we considered the women’s bodies were the focus of the images, not the boots, and the nudity was not relevant to the products.For those reasons, we considered that the ad objectified the women depicted and gave the impression that their bodies were sexual objects. We therefore concluded that the ad included a harmful gender stereotype and was likely to cause serious offence. The ad breached CAP (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Jaded London Ltd to ensure that future ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious offence, including by featuring a harmful gender stereotype by objectifying or sexualising women.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/jaded-london-ltd-a24-1262531-jaded-london-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Lead Pronto Ltd t/a LeadPronto,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on home efficiency scheme grants, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 11 December 2024. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Two paid-for Meta ads for Gov Boiler Funding and two paid-for Meta ads for The Free Boiler Scheme: a. The first ad for Gov Boiler Funding, published on 18 June 2024, included text that stated, “GB ATTENTION UK HOMEOWNERS: You can now claim a FREE Boiler Grant if you or someone in your household is claiming benefits!

Text underneath stated, “UK Homeowners Claim Your FREE Boiler Grant Apply Now” with a button labelled “Apply now”.",The ASA challenged whether the ads:,"1. Lead Pronto Ltd t/a Gov Boiler Funding and The Free Boiler Scheme said that the free boiler scheme was legitimate. They were not endorsed by the government but the companies they worked with would receive funding from the government. Whilst Lead Pronto did not use the GOV.UK crown logo, they acknowledged that some of the adverts included a logo that looked similar to it. It included the words ‘GOV UK’, but it was not the actual government logo. Nonetheless, they recognised that they should not use that logo. Because the free boiler scheme was a government scheme, it was almost impossible not to describe it in words other than that. They accepted that they should explain that they were not the government, but did not believe that people thought they were. They included government links in the ads so that consumers could see that it was a legitimate government grant. Additionally, at no point did they say that they were the installers. They had been running campaigns for many years in the aim of helping people find legitimate grants. They passed their leads to companies to ensure people who could qualify for funding received the right information. They would remove any ads that used the word ‘GOV’. 2. They said that they would change the wording in their ads so that they were not seen as installers, but rather that they connected customers to an installer who could check if they qualified for the grant.They worked hard behind the scenes to ensure customers who qualified got the right service, and therefore believed that statements such as “check if you qualify” were reasonable as that is what they did.","The ASA considered that the name “Gov Boiler Funding” in ads (a) and (b), the use of “GOV.UK” in isolation in ads (b) and (d) and alongside a previous version of the crown logo used by GOV.UK in ad (c), and the references to “Backed by the Government”, as well as other references to the Government, in all of the ads would be interpreted by consumers to mean that Gov Boiler Funding and The Free Boiler Scheme were associated with or endorsed by the UK Government. We further considered that the profile logo in ads (a) and (b) resembled UK government department logos, and the presentation of ads (a) and (c), such as the fonts and graphics used, were similar to those used on UK government department websites and social media accounts, and therefore added to that impression. We understood that at the time the ads were seen there was a government-endorsed home energy efficiency scheme available that included boiler upgrades and replacements, but that Gov Boiler Funding and The Free Boiler Scheme were not specifically associated with or endorsed by the government in any way. Because the ads gave the impression that Gov Boiler Funding and The Free Boiler Scheme were associated with or endorsed by the UK Government, when that was not the case, we concluded that the ads were misleading. On that point, ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.50 (Endorsements and Testimonials). The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not falsely claim or imply that the marketer was acting for purposes outside its trade, business, craft or profession and should make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. We considered that consumers would understand from the ads that Gov Boiler Funding and The Free Boiler Scheme would assess consumers’ eligibility to receive a grant to get a free boiler, and, if eligible, claim the grant through them. However, we understood that the purpose of the ads was to gain interest from customers and then pass their contact details on to the suppliers that they worked with. Because Gov Boiler Funding and The Free Boiler Scheme did not make clear that they were primarily a lead generating business that provided consumers’ contact details to boiler installers, and instead implied that they were companies offering grants for a free boiler, we concluded that they misleadingly implied they were acting for purposes outside of their profession and breached the Code. On that point, ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Lead Pronto Ltd t/a Gov Boiler Funding and The Free Boiler Scheme to ensure their future ads did not misleadingly imply that they were associated with or endorsed by the UK Government.

ASA Ruling on Metamind AI Ltd t/a AI Persona,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An in-game ad for the mobile app game AI Persona: AI Talk AI Friend, seen in the mobile app game Tower War – Tactical Conquest on 2 July 2024, featured a video with text which stated, “Download AI Persona see what they say!” It featured an image of a female character with bare shoulders and in the background were tiles of images of female characters all with large breasts posing in lingerie or tight revealing clothing. One animated image depicted a female character with a very youthful appearance, dressed in a tight shirt and mini skirt. Beneath the image text stated, “CREATE AI CHARACTER” with the “STUDENT” option highlighted. Another image depicted a female character with a stethoscope around her neck with the text “NURSE” highlighted. Some of the other female characters were depicted as “STEPMOTHER” or “STEPMOM” and were posing in a suggestive manner, with one featuring text which stated, “ROLEPLAY WITH AI STEPMOM”. Another image featured a screenshot of a text chat on a mobile phone sent by “Stepmom” which stated, “Your dad is away for a while…What are you going to do?” The reply stated, “I guess you can show me something in your room [winking face emoji]”.",,"1. & 2. Metamind AI Ltd t/a AI Persona: AI Talk AI Friend said that prior to being notified of the complaint, they were informed by the advertising network AppLovin about an issue with their ads. They conducted a detailed investigation and found that a small independent channel used what they considered to be vulgar content which they had reported to various media platforms. They subsequently blocked all advertising operations with the channel and had terminated their relationship with them. They also suspended ads in the UK and said they aimed to follow the regulations and policies of the countries they operated in to provide users with safe and compliant products and services. AppLovin Corporation, the ad network that served the ad, said their terms of use included content restrictions which prohibited ads that could be considered explicit or offensive, among other prohibited categories. Advertisers agreed that their ads would comply with those requirements and all applicable laws and regulations. AppLovin also made clear that non-compliance would result in ads being blocked and/or a ban of advertisers’ AppLovin accounts.They said upon receiving notification of the complaint, they contacted the advertiser to confirm that the ad would not be re-used or re-served through the AppLovin platform, and they reminded the advertiser about their policies concerning ads.","We were concerned by Metamind AI Ltd's failure to provide their geographical business address, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7.1 (Compliance). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide this information to the ASA or CAP without delay if requested. The ad, which was for a game app, showed different AI characters who were described as “Student”, “Stepmother”, “Career Women” or “Nurse” that could be used. It featured only female characters, all of whom had very large breasts, wore tight clothing and were posing in a manner which accentuated the top half of their bodies. The female characters described as “Stepmother” were portrayed as having a flirtatious manner either through their appearance or pose. One image in the ad showed text messages on a mobile phone with the name “Stepmom” at the top of the phone screen. It stated, “Your dad is away for a while… What are you going to do?” The reply was, “I guess you can show me something in your room” with a winking face emoji. We considered that viewers would understand that the text messages were between the stepmother character and her stepchild and would interpret their interaction as being sexually suggestive. Given the ad’s reference to the father being away, we considered the implication of the messages was that the stepchild was having a relationship of a sexual nature with their stepmother. We considered that the ad used tropes from pornography to portray the female characters as sexual objects which objectified and stereotyped them. Because the ad included harmful gender stereotypes and was likely to cause serious offence, we therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence). The CAP Code also stated that marketing communications must not portray or represent anyone who was, or seemed to be, under 18 years of age in a sexual way.One of the female characters was described as a “student”. She was dressed in a white blouse and black pleated skirt, with the straps of a backpack bag visible over her shoulders, which we considered was typical of a school uniform for someone under 18 years of age. However, while her facial features were very youthful and childlike, she was depicted as having a voluptuous body, and the skirt she wore was extremely short and the blouse was tight over her large breasts. We considered that because of her appearance, along with the “student” characterisation, the ad had the effect of portraying someone under 18 years of age in a sexual way. We therefore concluded the ad also breached the Code by portraying or representing someone who seemed to be under 18 in a sexual way. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.1 and 4.8 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Metamind AI Ltd t/a AI Persona AI Talk AI Friend to ensure that their ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious or widespread offence, and not to harmfully stereotype women as sexual objects. We also told them not to portray or represent anyone who was, or seemed to be, under 18 years of age in a sexual way.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/metamind-ai-ltd-a24-1251099-metamind-ai-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Ovira Australia t/a Ovira UK,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","Three paid-for Meta ads for Ovira, a food supplement company: a. The first ad, published on 5 June 2024, included text that stated, “‘I was close on getting on prescription weight loss medication but decided to give these a try and I am amazed. I take them first thing in the morning on an empty stomach. I Notice [sic] a good energy boost from them which is a plus for me. I hardly get hungry throughout the day so I started taking multivitamins and protein shakes to get some kind of nutrition. If you want to stop putting away the sweet stuff, try this product.

The ad included an image with text that stated, ""POV: when u have PCOS and try the ozemp*c dupe pills and finally lose weight"" and a photo from a Harry Potter film with text that stated, ""WHAT KIND OF SORCERY IS THIS"". Further text underneath stated, ""Highest rated cravings supplement (4.9/5) Get FAST relief from cravings. Food Craving Control Naturally Feel Full Faster & Stay Full Longer Reduction in Overall Appetite Optimize Fat Burning Efficiency Blood Sugar …"" and a button labelled ""Learn more"". b. The second ad, published on 17 June 2024, included the same text as in ad (a). The ad included an image with text that stated, ""when u hear that ozemp*c dupe pills work for menopause weight gain"". Further text underneath the image stated, “Proven Results”, and the same text as that underneath ad (a). c. The third ad, published on 17 June 2024, included text that stated, “‘I was skeptical [sic] when purchasing because I didn’t know if it would work. IMO it works a little too well! I can’t tell if I’m hungry. I almost feel like I’m forcing myself to eat. I don’t really like that feeling. But at least it’s working!’”. Text alongside ticked bullet points stated, “Fast Relief From Cravings”, “Boosts Metabolism”, “No Side Effects” “Real Results” and “Backed by Science”. The ad included an image of two Curb Crave bottles with text that stated, “SUMMER BODY IN A BOTTLE BURN HARD TO LOSE AREAS APPETITE SUPPRESSION BOOST METABOLISM LOSE 15-20% OF BODY WEIGHT WEIGHT LOSS FEEL FULLER FASTER & LONGER” and a button labelled “SHOP NOW”. Text underneath stated, “Proven Results” and then included the same text as underneath ad (a).",Two complainants challenged whether:,"Ovira Australia t/a Ovira said that the ads were part of a global campaign on Meta’s platform, which allowed targeting of users in any country, including the UK. They said that whilst this worldwide approach had been effective for them in reaching diverse audiences, they had not adapted the ads to meet the specific local requirements of the UK market. They confirmed that they had removed the ads and were also undertaking a review of all their marketing practices and implementing measures to ensure that all future ads complied with the CAP Codes.","The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB NHC Register) were permitted in marketing communications for foods. The Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food, drink or ingredient and health. Brand name or fancy names which may be construed as a health claim must be accompanied by a related authorised health claim. Ads (a) and (b) included the claims “Get FAST relief from cravings”, “Food Craving Control”, “Feel Full Faster & Stay Full Longer”, “Reduction in Overall Appetite” and “Optimize fat burning Efficiency Blood Sugar”. Ad (c) included the claims “BURN HARD TO LOSE AREAS”, “APPETITE SUPPRESSION” and “BOOST METABOLISM”. The ASA considered those were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code. However, we had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that those claims were authorised on the GB NHC Register. Ad (c) also featured the name “Curb Crave” on the supplement bottle, which we understood to be a fancy name for the product. We considered that claim was also a health claim. However, it was not accompanied by a related authorised health claim.We concluded the above claims were unauthorised claims and that the ads breached the Code. On that point, ads (a), (b) and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims), and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). The CAP Code stated that health claims that referred to a rate or amount of weight loss were not acceptable when made in relation to a food supplement.We considered that consumers would understand from the claim “LOSE 15-20% OF BODY WEIGHT” in ad (c), that by using the Curb Crave food supplement product, they could reduce their body weight by 15 to 20%. We considered that the claim referred to an amount of weight loss in relation to a supplement and therefore breached the Code. On that point, ad (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.6 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code stated that claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease were prohibited for foods; including food supplements. It also stated that medicinal claims may be made for a medicinal product that was licensed by the MHRA or under the auspices of the EMA. Medicines must have a license from the MHRA or under the auspices of the EMA before they were marketed. Ad (a) stated, “… when u have PCOS and try the ozemp*c dupe pills and finally lose weight"". Ad (b) stated, ""… when u hear that ozemp*c dupe pills work for menopause weight gain"". We considered those claims implied that the food supplement could treat or cure weight gain that was a symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the menopause. PCOS was a medical condition and we considered ad (a) therefore implied that the food supplement product could prevent, treat or cure that condition. While the menopause was not itself a medical condition, symptoms of the menopause were adverse medical conditions. We therefore considered that ad (b) also breached the Code in that regard. We further considered that the references in ads (a) and (b) to “prescription weight loss medication” and “ozemp*c dupe pills” implied that the food supplement had the same weight-loss effects as the prescription-only medicine Ozempic and other medicines prescribed for their weight-loss effects. Those claims therefore implied that the food supplement had medicinal properties, which fell under the prohibited claims that a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease. Additionally, claims that a product had medicinal properties may only be made for a licensed medicinal product. We had not seen evidence that the product was appropriately licensed. Because the ads implied that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure human disease, and featured claims that an unlicensed product had medicinal properties, we concluded that they breached the Code. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 12.1, 12.11 (Medicines, medical devices health-related products and beauty products), 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Ovira Australia t/a Ovira to ensure that specific health claims were authorised on the GB NHC register, and did not refer to a rate or amount of weight loss. They should not state or imply that a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease. We also told them not to make medicinal claims for unlicensed products.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/ovira-australia-g24-1252527-ovira-australia.html
ASA Ruling on Pulsio Ltd,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Pulsio Compression, a muscle compression product, seen on 2 October 2024. The ad included an image of an individual using the product with superimposed text that stated, “BLACK FRIDAY SALE NOW LIVE”. Crossed out text stated “£599”, alongside further text which stated “£299 SAVE £300”. Text in the caption stated, “ONLY £299 THIS BLACK FRIDAY. SAVE £300. Leading Compression Power Without The Price Tag”.","The complainant, who understood that the product had never been sold at the higher price, challenged whether the reference price and associated savings claims were misleading and could be substantiated.",Pulsio Ltd said they had removed the ad and had amended the promotional offer for their future advertising.,"The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the struck-out price of £599 that the promotional price represented a genuine reduction against the price at which the product was usually sold. We considered that consumers would also understand from the claims “SAVE £300” and “ONLY £299 THIS BLACK FRIDAY” that they would be able to achieve a genuine saving of £300 against the usual selling price of the product. We considered that impression was reinforced by the reference to Black Friday, and consumers were likely to interpret that to mean the promotional price would only be available for a short period of time, before reverting to being sold at the higher price once more. We did not receive any pricing history for the product from Pulsio, and therefore, we could not determine whether the referenced higher price in the ad was the usual selling price of the product. However, we understood that different reference and promotional prices had been advertised for the same product over a six-month period. On 22 May 2024, the product was advertised with a reference price of £799 and a promotional price of £399, on 11 September 2024 the product was advertised as having a 50% discount with a promotional price of £299.99, and in October 2024 the product was advertised as having a reference price of £599 with a promotional price of £299 as part of a Black Friday sale. We considered that the reference price of the compression product fluctuated throughout that period; for example, the reference price decreased by £200 between May 2024 and September 2024. Furthermore, we considered that the product appeared to have been discounted throughout the six-month period. Moreover, we understood that there was only a 99 pence reduction between the Black Friday sale price as seen in the ad, and the previous promotional price seen in September 2024. Given that the reference price changed over a short period of time, that the product had been discounted several times within that period, and we had not been supplied with any pricing history, we considered that Pulsio had not demonstrated that £599 was the usual selling price of the product at the time of sale. Because we had not seen evidence that the savings claims represented a genuine saving against the usual selling price of the product, we concluded that the savings claims in the ad were misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 3.17 (Prices).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Pulsio Ltd to ensure that future savings claims did not mislead and that they substantiated any savings claims against the usual selling price of the product.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/pulsio-ltd-a24-1262766-pulsio-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Samsung Electronics (UK) Ltd t/a Samsung,,"The website www.samsung.com, seen in June 2024, included a webpage for a cashback promotion. Text stated, “Claim up to £500 cashback when you buy selected Samsung products. Hurry, offer ends of [sic] 2nd July”. A further webpage stated, “With up to £500 cashback on selected devices, now’s the time to experience the Galaxy AI universe”. Further text stated, “Purchase a qualifying Samsung product from a participating retailer between 5th June 2024 and 2nd July 2024 to be eligible for up to £500 cashback. Claims must be submitted within 45 days of purchase”. Below four text boxes outlined the steps to claim cashback and included the text “3. We check your claim. We’ll let you know within 5 working days whether your claim has been approved. You can check the progress anytime by using Track My Claim” and “4. Cashback. Once your claim has been approved, we’ll send your cashback to the bank account provided on your Claim form within 45 days”.","Thirteen complainants, who had not received their cashback within 45 days of the claim being approved despite fulfilling the terms of the promotion, challenged whether the promotion was administered fairly.","Samsung Electronics (UK) Ltd t/a Samsung said that of all validated claims, 10% had taken longer than the 45-day deadline for the cashback payment, with 3% of those claims exceeding 60 days. They explained that they used their third-party handling agency to process cashback claims and that they were advised there had been a delay in processing some claims due to a maintenance system issue at their bank which resulted in the failure of all payments being processed at that time. The third party had not received any notification of the error from the bank until 23 August 2024, and because of the error, immediately carried out a manual check to identify which payments remained outstanding and ensure the impact to consumers was minimal. They explained that due to this issue outside of their control, some of the claims were processed beyond the 45-day payment deadline. They said of the claims that exceeded the 45-day payment deadline, 43.4% had been processed before the banking error and 56.6% were processed after. Of those claims processed before the banking error, 53% were delayed due to the bank processing error directly. A further 45% were delayed due to an internal, human processing error, impacted by serial number checks; however, they highlighted that the error was not due to a lack of adequate resources available to administer the promotion and had since implemented measures to ensure the same error would not occur in future promotions. The remainder of the claims that fell outside the 45-day payment timeframe were due to the provision of incorrect bank details by the consumer. Of the cashback payments made after the banking error, 99% of claims exceeded the 45-day timeframe due to a backlog within their payments team caused by the repercussions of the bank processing error, that affected claims at various stages of the claim process. They explained claims in the backlog would not have had the full 45 days from the date of notification of the error and therefore may only have had a few days before they went outside the 45-day timeframe. They said those payments were made between one and nine days after the 45-day deadline. In addition, 1% of those claims which fell outside the 45-day payment timeframe were due to the provision of incorrect bank details by the consumer. They said, in those instances, the length of time it took consumers to respond was outside of their control and in some instances substantial delays in a response from a consumer would cause delays to the payment, resulting in claims being paid outside of the 45 days. They further highlighted that the payment delays were not due to a failure in meeting the response rate or in estimating the likely response but instead due to an error outside their control. They explained that, throughout the claim process, consumers were able to use a function on the claim site that showed the entire process from claim date through to the date the claim was completed. They also said that all affected customers were kept updated throughout the process and their communications included an email on 23 August explaining the delay. They had also sent a further email on the 29 August, advising customers that their payment had now been processed and would soon be available in their bank. They said they had been willing to provide an assurance that they would review whether they needed to extend their cashback payment timeframe for future promotions.","The CAP Code stated that promoters were responsible for all aspects and all stages of their promotions and that promoters must conduct their promotions equitably, promptly and efficiently and be seen to deal fairly and honourably with participants and potential participants. Promoters must avoid causing unnecessary disappointment. Additionally, the Code required promoters to ensure that their promotions were conducted under proper supervision and make adequate resources available to administer them, and not to give consumers justifiable grounds for complaint. The ad explained the different steps that were necessary to fulfil in order to receive the cashback. It stated that it was necessary to purchase a qualifying product within a specific timeframe, make a claim within 1 to 45 days, and that, once a claim had been approved, that participants would receive their cashback within 45 days. The ASA considered that consumers would understand the terms of the promotion to mean that if they had purchased a qualifying product and submitted their claim within the correct time period, they would receive a cashback payment of up to £500 within 45 days of being notified that their claim was successful. We also considered the timeframe within which the cashback payment would be received was a significant condition that would affect a participant’s decision to take part in the promotion. We understood that of all cashback claims that had been made, approximately 10% had been paid outside of the 45-day timeframe. We understood that the majority of those payments made outside of the 45-day deadline had been affected by a banking error. We further understood that 23% of those claims had been directly impacted by the bank processing error, however, 56% had been delayed due to an internal backlog of payments caused by the banking error. We considered the payment backlog was within Samsung’s control, and although there was a delay, 45 days should still have been a sufficient length of time to allow the payments to be made, and we therefore considered that they had not ensured they administered the promotion fairly. Furthermore, 2% of the total claims, 20% of those claims that fell outside the payment timeframe, were affected by a further internal issue which we acknowledged was due to human error and not a lack of resources. Nevertheless, we considered it was still their responsibility as part of the administration of the process to take into account errors that might occur in the process to ensure consumers did not have justifiable grounds for complaint. We considered the number of consumers impacted by issues caused by the administration of the promotion was significant and had, therefore, caused consumers unnecessary disappointment because they did not receive their cashback as described in the terms of the promotion. We acknowledged that Samsung said consumers were able to track the progress of their claims via the dedicated website and that they had sent communications to those consumers affected by the banking error. However, we understood that some complainants could no longer use the tracking tool, had not received any emails updating them on the progress of their claims, nor had they received responses to their queries. In any case, we considered that a participant’s ability to track their claim via the dedicated website did not negate the need for Samsung to pay the cashback within the 45-day timeframe as stipulated in the terms of the promotion. Because a significant number of consumers had not received their cashback payment within the timeframe set out in the terms, we concluded the promotion had not been administered fairly and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.14 (Promotional marketing).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Samsung Electronics (UK) Ltd t/a Samsung to ensure they did not cause unnecessary disappointment and that their promotions were administered fairly by ensuring they adhered to their promotional terms.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/samsung-electronics--uk--ltd-g24-1255968-samsung-electronics--uk--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Sparring Partners Ltd t/a Gymbox,,"An Instagram ad for Gymbox Official, posted on 20 September 2024, included text that stated, “AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THE GYMBOX TEAM”. The ad included a photo of a condom pack with text on it that stated, “PRACTICE SAFE SETS GYMBOX”. Further text stated, “PRODUCT RECALL Recently we handed out over 6,000 condoms as part of a promotional giveaway […] We are recalling batch 3809-3. We are sincerely sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you. For more information and any concerns, please email [email protected] .”","The complainants, who understood that the product recall for the condoms was a hoax, challenged whether the ad was irresponsible and caused undue distress.","Sparring Partners Ltd t/a Gymbox said that the ad was not just a way of promoting their gym membership, but it was also a way to promote sexual health awareness. They stated that if consumers emailed the address in the ad, they received an immediate response email which included advice and support on the topic of sexual health. They said that all health was important to them as a company, and they believed it was a good way to promote this topic. They provided a copy of the email. They said that they would remove the ad.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, and must not cause fear or distress without justifiable reason.The ad included an image of a Gymbox branded condom and stated that the condoms they had recently handed out were being recalled. We understood that the product recall was a hoax. We considered that consumers who had been given a free condom from Gymbox and had seen the ad, were likely to understand that the condoms had a fault which may have made them less effective at preventing pregnancy or reducing the risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. We considered that unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections were serious concerns for consumers because they could have life-changing implications. We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to have caused distress to some consumers. We noted that the ad included an email address and, if consumers contacted this address, they received an email that explained that the product recall was a joke and offered them a promotional code for Gymbox membership and a brief message on where to get information about sexual health. However, we considered that many people who saw the ad would not have emailed Gymbox to seek more information and therefore, because there was nothing in the ad itself to explain that the product recall was a hoax, would be unaware that it was a joke. We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to cause undue distress without justifiable reason and was irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social Responsibility) and 4.2 (Harm and Offence).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on get_0ut_0f_debt Ltd,,"A TikTok video from the get_0ut_0f_debt TikTok account, seen in September 2024, showed a man standing on a chair in an empty office. He placed a looped length of cord around his neck. The other end of the cord was suspended above his head. Text stated, “Had to sleep here last night because got evicted due to debt, everyone knows I’m not in a good place, can’t take it any more… can you relate?” The scene then cut to colleagues running through the door. The man was lying face down and motionless on the floor with the cord around his neck and the other end of the cord reaching up towards the ceiling. One of the colleagues attempted to rouse the man and dialled 999 on their mobile phone. The man remained lying on the floor as the camera zoomed out. The soundtrack to the video featured the song lyric “One step closer”.","The Insolvency Service challenged whether the ad was irresponsible, distressing and offensive.","get_0ut_0f_debt Ltd t/a get_0ut_0f_debt said the video was an organic post rather than a paid ad. They said they posted regularly on a variety of subjects. Their aim was to highlight mental health issues and their causes. They said on reflection they could appreciate why the post, which was no longer appearing, might have been perceived in the way it had. They gave an assurance that they would not repeat the approach and that they would remove any posts of a similar nature. They intended to seek guidance in future to ensure that their content was in line with the Code.","The ASA first assessed whether the post was an ad for the purposes of the Code. The video was posted on get_0ut_0f_debt’s business account on TikTok. Text showing the TikTok handle for the page appeared on screen throughout the video. We considered that viewers would understand that the video, which referenced debt problems, promoted the service offered by get_0ut_0f_debt. We therefore considered that the video constituted an ad for the purposes of the Code. The CAP Code required that ads be prepared with a sense of responsibility to the audience and to society and not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. They must not cause fear or distress without justifiable reason and, if it could be justified, the fear or distress should not be excessive. The video showed a man placing a cord around his neck. He was then seen lying face down on the floor and did not respond to an attempt to rouse him. The on-screen text referred to eviction due to debt and stated, “… everyone knows I’m not in a good place, can’t take it any more”. We considered that viewers would understand that the man was distressed due to being in debt and had chosen to end his life because of his financial situation. We considered that the depiction of colleagues rushing to help, alongside the implication that it was too late to save the man, added to the distressing tone. We considered that the ad, in highlighting and demonstrating a method of suicide, and creating an association between debt and suicide, was irresponsible, and that the graphic nature of the portrayal was likely to cause serious offence, and significant distress, which was not justified by its context. In particular, we considered that the question “can you relate?” was irresponsible in appealing to consumers who were experiencing problems with debt, who were likely to be particularly vulnerable. We concluded that the ad was irresponsible and likely to cause serious offence and unjustified distress. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.2 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Bodystreet Franchise (UK) Ltd,,"A paid-for Instagram ad for Bodystreet, a fitness centre, seen on 25 July 2024, featured text stating, “Just one 20-minute session per week is equivalent to 3 one-hour sessions at a regular gym”. The ad also featured images of people exercising whilst wearing a vest that appeared to have electrodes attached to it.",The complainant challenged whether the claim “Just one 20-minute session per week is equivalent to 3 one-hour sessions at a regular gym” was misleading and could be substantiated.,"Bodystreet Franchise (UK) Ltd t/a Bodystreet believed their claim was supported by various studies about the impact of electrical myostimulation (EMS) training, and that their claim was an understatement rather than an exaggeration. They explained that, according to a YouTube video produced by the manufacturer, whole-body EMS delivered 85 muscle contractions per second, whereas with a conventional workout each muscle contraction would take between 1 and 1.5 seconds. They said that, in a conventional workout, each set of 10–15 muscle contractions with a two-minute rest period would be required to affect results. They did not believe that was the case with whole-body EMS training. They believed that EMS training worked muscles 40% harder and said that both the agonistic and antagonistic muscles were worked at the same time in EMS training, further reducing the workout time. They submitted five studies, one article written by a research institute providing an overview of EMS and a document summarising six unpublished diploma theses on whole-body EMS from a university. They also provided a fact sheet produced by an EMS device manufacturer, which stated, “EMS training sessions last 20 minutes. This 20-minute workout delivers the same benefits as two and half hours of conventional strength training, and two hours of high intensity training (HIT)”.The Bodystreet said that they had removed the claim from their ad.","The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim to mean that one 20-minute session at Bodystreet per week would provide an individual with the same physiological results, such as weight loss, cardio and muscle improvements, as three one-hour sessions at a regular gym and could therefore be used as a time saving alternative to a traditional gym workout.We accepted that when electrical stimulation (EMS) devices were applied to the abdominal region they could temporarily tighten and tone muscles, and that this could be maintained with repeated use. However, claims that muscle stimulators could be used as a slimming application, could facilitate weight and inch loss, reduce fat, help break down cellulite or fatty deposits, tighten and tone sagging body muscle, enhance muscles, restore muscle strength or change fat into muscle were unlikely to be acceptable without robust clinical trial evidence. We considered that a substantive body of relevant evidence, consisting of clinical trials conducted on humans that had been published and peer-reviewed, was needed to substantiate the claim.We assessed the evidence provided by Bodystreet. The first study looked at 30 postmenopausal women aged 55 and older, and compared the effects of exercising whilst wearing a whole-body EMS device on resting metabolic rate, body composition and maximum strength against traditional training methods. Whilst improvements in strength and abdominal fatness were reportedly higher for the EMS group compared to the traditional training group, we considered that the study had a small cohort of a sub-group of people not representative of the general population and that the results did not show that one 20-minute session of EMS per week was equivalent to three one-hour sessions at the gym. We therefore considered the study was not adequate substantiation for the claim. The second study was a randomised controlled trial comparing the effects of exercising whilst wearing a whole-body EMS device to high intensity resistance (HIT) training on body composition and muscle strength in a cohort of 48 men between 30 and 50 years of age. The study reported that there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of improvements in body composition and muscle strength. Notwithstanding that, we also considered that there were limitations with the study, in particular the cohort was small and limited to a sub-group of people not representative of the general population. We therefore considered the study was not adequate substantiation for the claim. The third study looked at the effects of whole-body EMS training on strength, sprinting, jumping and kicking measures in 22 elite football players over a period of 14 weeks and compared these with traditional training methods. Whilst the study reported significant differences between the two groups, with those in the EMS group achieving significantly greater improvements in the outcome measures, we considered that the cohort was small and not representative of the general population. Also, the study did not show that one 20-minute session of EMS per week was equivalent to three one-hour sessions. We therefore considered it was not adequate substantiation for the claim. The fourth study, again involving professional football players and therefore not representative of the general population, reported the effect of whole-body EMS on human red blood cell deformability. We considered that the outcome measures were not sufficiently relevant to the claim in the ad and therefore the study was not adequate substantiation for the claim. The fifth study measured the effect of a 12-week whole-body EMS training programme compared to traditional training on physical performance and cardiometabolic markers in 28 obese females aged around 18 years. Although significant outcomes were reported in the EMS group compared with the control group, the study was limited by the size of the cohort and was not representative of the general population. Furthermore, the results did not show that one 20-minute session of EMS per week was equivalent to three one-hour sessions. For those reasons, we considered the study was not adequate substantiation for the claim. We considered that the article by a research institute, which provided an overview of EMS training, including the risks and guidelines, was not adequate substantiation for the claim. We considered that the document summarising six unpublished diploma theses on whole-body EMS from a university was not adequate substantiation for the claim because the document provided summaries and not the full studies. Also, the theses had not been peer-reviewed.We considered that the factsheet and YouTube video from an EMS device manufacturer was not adequate substantiation for the claim. For those reasons, we considered that the claim “Just one 20-minute session per week is equivalent to 3 one-hour sessions at a regular gym” had not been substantiated and concluded that the ad was therefore misleading. We welcomed the Bodystreet’s assurance that they had removed the claim from their ad. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.11 (Exaggeration).","The ad must not appear again in its current form.

ASA Ruling on Churchill Retirement Living Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on promotional offers on retirement properties, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 13 November 2024.","A national newspaper ad for Churchill Retirement Living, a retirement property company, published on 24 April 2024, included text that stated, “RETIREMENT APARTMENTS FOR SALE”. Further text stated, “For a limited time only receive up to £20,000 Cashback* or select a Moving Package worth thousands* - It’s your choice”. Small text at the bottom of the ad stated, “*T&Cs apply, visit our website for more information”.",The ASA challenged whether the conditions of the promotion had been made sufficiently clear.,"Churchill Retirement Living Ltd said that they had taken care to ensure the ad made clear that the offer was time related and that there was a cap of the monetary incentive. It clearly stated that terms and conditions applied, and that they could be found on the website. Given the relatively small size of the advert, they did not believe it was realistic to have the full terms and conditions within the ad itself. They took care to ensure that the full terms and conditions were clear and easily accessible from the homepage of the website for the duration of the campaign. Although their customers were seniors, their experience was that they had good access to the internet – either directly or with the help of family and friends – and that potential customers considering a major purchase such as this would be capable of accessing the website to read the information. Nevertheless, should any potential customers have been without internet access, a phone number was provided on the ad which enabled customers to speak to a member of their team to find out more, or request information to be sent to them by post. The cashback offered in the promotion was for 3% of the purchase price, up to a maximum of £20,000. They said they had a number of properties available in the promotion whereby 3% of the purchase price would have exceeded £20,000, and that was why the cashback was capped at that amount.","The CAP Code stated that all marketing communications or other material referring to promotions must communicate all applicable significant conditions or information where the omission of such conditions or information was likely to mislead, including a prominent closing date if applicable. The ASA considered consumers would understand from the claim “For a limited time only receive up to £20,00 Cashback* or select a Moving Package worth thousands*” that the promotion was time limited.We understood that to be eligible for either the cashback or the moving package, consumers had to have completed the purchase of the property by 21 June 2024. That information was not specified in the ad. We considered that the duration of the promotional period and the speed at which it was necessary to complete the sale of the property was information likely to influence consumers’ understanding of and decisions about the promotion. They were therefore significant conditions which should have been stated prominently in the ad. We also understood that there were further terms and conditions to the promotion, including that the cashback was calculated at 3% of the purchase price up to a maximum of £20,000, the offer was only available on selected apartments at participating developments and it only applied to new properties. We considered those were significant conditions that were likely to affect a consumer’s understanding of the promotion and their decision to participate, and they should also have been stated prominently in the ad.We considered that the omission of those significant conditions was likely to mislead. We acknowledged that the asterisks linked to small text at the bottom of the ad that stated, “*T&Cs apply, visit our website for more information” and the ad included a web address. However, the address provided was not specific to where the terms and conditions could be found on the website. In any case, we considered the ad was not sufficiently limited by time or space to justify their omission. We concluded that because the ad had omitted significant conditions, including a prominent closing date, the promotion breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.17, 8.17.1, 8.17.4 and 8.17.4.a (Promotional marketing).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Churchill Retirement Living Ltd to ensure that their future promotions communicated all applicable significant conditions or information, including a prominent closing date, where the omission of such information was likely to mislead consumers.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/churchill-retirement-living-ltd-a24-1248717-churchill-retirement-living-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Vita Studio Pte Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An in-game ad for the mobile app game Vita Mahjong, seen on 20 July 2024 in the mobile app game Crossword Jam, featured a man wearing blue medical scrubs. On-screen text stated, “I recommended [sic] you to play Vita Mahjong […] It’s a game designed Exclusively for people with memory loss and sleep loss […] Play it for 30 minutes everyday it will greatly help you with memory and sleep”.",Two complainants challenged whether:,"Vita Studio Pte Ltd said that upon being made aware of the complaint, they had conducted a thorough review and taken action to address the issues raised. They said the ad had been removed from circulation, apologised for any issues it may have caused, and confirmed that they would be strengthening their internal review processes, to help ensure future ads adhered to the CAP Code and industry standards.","The CAP Code stated that marketers must not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. For example, they must not offer specific advice on, diagnosis of, or treatment for such conditions, unless that advice, diagnosis or treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional.The ad stated, “It’s a game designed Exclusively for people with memory loss […] Play it for 30 minutes everyday it will greatly help you with memory”. We considered that implied that the Vita Mahjong mobile app game could help people suffering from memory loss problems. We considered that memory loss was a condition for which medical supervision should be sought. While we welcomed Vita Studio’s assurance that the ad had been removed from circulation, they did not supply any evidence in their response which showed that their app provided treatment conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. We therefore concluded that the ad discouraged essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought and had breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.2 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). We considered that consumers would understand the claim “It’s a game designed Exclusively for people with […] sleep loss […] Play it for 30 minutes everyday it will greatly help you with […] sleep” to mean that the Vita Mahjong mobile app game was capable of helping people who suffer from problems with sleep loss to improve their sleeping, if they played the game for 30 minutes daily. We further considered that the appearance of the man seen in the ad, who was wearing medical scrubs, reinforced the impression that the app could provide a medical benefit to users. We therefore expected to see robust documentary evidence substantiating the claim that playing the Vita Mahjong app would help with sleep problems, consisting of clinical trials conducted on people. However, as above, we received no evidence from the advertiser to substantiate that the app could help people suffering with sleep loss. In the absence of such evidence, we concluded that the claim had not been substantiated and was therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Vita Studio Pte Ltd not to make claims that discouraged the essential treatment for a condition for which medical supervision should be sought. We also told them to ensure that they did not make claims that stated or implied that they could help treat sleep loss problems.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/vita-studio-pte-ltd-g24-1253610-vita-studio-pte-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Samsung Electronics (UK) Ltd,,"A webpage on the Samsung website, seen on 14 July 2024, featured text which stated, “Claim 6 months free Persil detergent when you buy a Samsung 11kg ecobubble washing machine”, alongside an image of a washing machine containing stuffed animal toys. Further text stated, “Step 1 Purchase a qualifying Samsung 11kg Washing Machine between 15th May 2024 and 31st January 2025. Step 2 submit your claim using your receipt. Step 3 use the coupon within 90 days from the day of issue in a participating retailer to receive your free product”. Terms and conditions located at the bottom of the webpage stated, “Using this coupon, there are three products available to redeem: a. 55W Persil Wonder Wash Liquid (Speed Clean Non-Bio, Odour Defy, Ultra Care) for a value of £7.00 discounted off the product or via cashback; b. 48W Capsules (Bio, Non-Bio, Colour) for the value of £10.50 cashback; c. 46W Ultimate Liquid (Touch of Comfort, Active Clean, Fresh and Mild) for a value of £7.50 discounted off the product or via cashback.”",The complainant challenged whether the ad was misleading and the promotion breached the Code.,"Samsung Electronics (UK) Ltd confirmed that they had a commercial relationship with Persil and that Persil had approved all of their promotional marketing materials. They also confirmed that Persil had provided the terms and conditions for the promotion. Before the promotion started, they believed that the vouchers would be sufficient to cover the total cost of the products and reiterated that the use of the word “free” had been approved by Persil. They explained that, upon notification of the complaint, Persil had confirmed that, since retailers were free to set their own prices, in some cases the coupon value, which was set based on the products’ promotional Recommended Retail Price (RRP) would be less than the retail price. After notification of the complaint, they agreed with Persil to increase the value of the voucher which would mean most of the redeemable products were “free” and, in addition, Samsung would amend the ad to remove the term “free”. Samsung also agreed, other than the short terms and conditions located at the bottom of the webpage, the ad did not make clear that consumers would have to pay for one of the products upfront before receiving cashback. They also said that Persil had outlined their intention to change the mechanic of the promotion to remove the coupon, and instead, all participants would be able to claim cashback up to the RRP of the detergent products. When that change was made, they said they would amend the ad to make it clear to participants that they would have to claim cashback for the products. Samsung believed that the picture of the three Persil products included within the ad suggested to participants that it was possible to redeem all three products. They also believed that it was clear that all three products were available as part of the promotion throughout the customer journey of making a claim for the products. However, because of the complaint, they agreed to make that clearer within the ad. They therefore planned to update the ad to make it clear that participants would be eligible to redeem cashback for all three products. Samsung also referred to the full terms and conditions of the promotion, and highlighted that they made clear that only 3,000 vouchers were available for each of the three products and that participants only had 20 minutes after they clicked the link to redeem the coupon. Despite that, they agreed that those significant conditions could have been made clearer in the ad. They confirmed that they would make it clear that there were only 3,000 coupons available. However, because the mechanic of the promotion was changing, and it would no longer rely on coupons, they said it would not be necessary to state the 20-minute stipulation. Samsung confirmed that they had not received any other complaints directly in relation to this ad or promotion. Unilever UK Ltd t/a Persil confirmed that they had a commercial relationship with Samsung. They agreed to the launch of the digital coupon campaign in collaboration with Samsung, whereby consumers who purchased a Samsung washing machine of at least 11 kg could claim a digital coupon for the 55W Persil Wonder Wash, 48W Persil Capsules and the 46W Persil Ultimate Liquid. They stated that the promotion was scheduled to run from 15 May 2024 until 31 January 2025, or until all of the coupons had been redeemed. Persil explained the promotional mechanic in more depth. They said that the digital coupons were administered via a third party, and that there were two options for participants in the promotion; namely, that they could use the coupon to pay for the products up to the value described in the terms and conditions; or purchase the products and then claim cashback up to the value described in the terms and conditions. They stated that there were 3,000 coupons available for redemption across the UK for each of the three products. They did not, however, expect to run out of coupons before the end of the promotional period. They explained that the limit of 3,000 coupons was calculated as an estimate of the total number of consumers likely to redeem the coupons. It was not intended to be a limited promotion whereby there were many consumers unable to redeem the coupons who had wished to. For that reason, they said they did not include the coupon restriction within the ad, but as a result of the complaint, intended to add this condition to the abridged terms and conditions viewable within the ad. Persil said that the cashback option had been offered for two reasons; specifically, because some retailers were not able to manage digital coupons, and because there was a limit to the value which could be redeemed by a digital coupon. Because of that, the Persil 48W Capsules were available on a cashback only basis. They confirmed that the money-off coupon option was available for the other two products included in the promotion. They highlighted that this information was explicitly referenced in the terms and conditions of the promotion as a significant condition. With regards to the use of “free” within the ad, Persil said that retailers were able to establish their own retail prices. The promotional terms and conditions included a reference to the maximum value of the coupon or cashback that Persil would provide and a statement clarifying that where the price was greater the difference would have to be covered by the consumer. Notwithstanding that, they acknowledged that the value of the coupons offered was not equivalent to the relevant RRP for each of the products. They confirmed that the word “free” would be removed from all relevant marketing communications. Persil said that both the short- and long-form terms and conditions referenced all three Persil products, and that it was clear, once the participant registered for the coupon, that it was possible to redeem all three products. They explained that those participants would receive a text message with a link to the coupon code for all three products. They reiterated that participants would receive clear communication that they could use the voucher against all three products. Persil also explained the stipulation that the coupons must be used within 20 minutes after activation was listed in the full terms and conditions. They also supplied a copy of a digital coupon which they said made clear that the participants should not click the coupon until they are ready to checkout. They confirmed that they had received no further complaints directly in relation to this ad or promotion.","The CAP Code made clear that marketing communications must not describe a product as ""free” if the consumer had to pay anything other than the unavoidable cost of responding and collecting, or paying for delivery, of the item. Furthermore, the Code stated that all marketing communications referring to promotions must state all applicable significant conditions where their omission was likely to mislead. Significant conditions may, depending on the circumstances, include information about how to participate and technological or other restrictions. The Code also stated promoters must not encourage consumers to make a purchase or series of purchases as a precondition to applying for promotional items if the number of those items is limited, unless the limitation is made sufficiently clear at each stage for them to accurately to assess whether participation is worthwhile. The ASA welcomed the assurances from both advertisers that they would amend the ad to comply with the CAP Code. The ad stated, “Claim 6 months Free Persil detergent” in large font, and immediately underneath that, smaller text continued “when you buy a Samsung 11kg ecobubble washing machine”. The ASA considered that consumers would understand that, upon purchase of the specified Samsung washing machine, they would receive a six-month supply of Persil detergent. On that basis, we considered that consumers would understand that they would not have to pay towards the cost of the detergent in order to redeem the promotional offer, nor would they have to pay the cost of the detergent upfront and then claim the money back at a later date. We considered that impression was furthered by the three steps listed underneath the promotion, which were necessary for consumers to fulfil in order to redeem the detergent. The steps outlined that participants must “purchase a qualifying Samsung 11kg Washing Machine”, “submit your claim using your receipt” and then “use the coupon within 90 days from the day of issue in a participating retailer to receive your free product”. We considered consumers would interpret that to mean, in return for the coupon, they would be able to receive the detergent at no cost to themselves.In addition, we noted that as part of the promotion there was no reference to a limit or restriction on the number of coupons available. Consequently, we considered that participants would assume that, on the condition that they purchased an eligible Samsung washing machine, they would be able to take part in the promotion and redeem the detergent. The coupon for the 55W Persil Wonder Wash Liquid amounted to £7.00, the 48W Capsules amounted to £10.50 and 46W Ultimate amounted to £7.50. However, we understood that the RRP of each product was higher than the value of the corresponding coupon. As such, we considered it was very likely that consumers would be unable to purchase the three products available to redeem using the coupon solely. In the case of the complainant, we noted that there was a £3, £1 and £1.50 price discrepancy across the three products respectively. We considered that the coupons did not, therefore, necessarily allow participants to redeem the detergent for free, at no cost to themselves. Furthermore, we understood that it was necessary for participants to purchase one of the products, the 48W Capsules, upfront. After purchase, participants could then apply for cashback up to the value of the coupon to be credited back to their account. We considered that was not made clear in the ad, and that consumers would be unaware that a specific product could only be purchased via a cashback mechanism. We acknowledged that the short-form terms and conditions stated, “48W Capsules (Bio, Non-Bio, Colour) for the value of £10.50 cashback”. However, we considered that the font used was small, and the text was located at the very bottom of the webpage, and as such, was likely to be missed by consumers. In any case, we considered that the text contradicted, rather than clarified, the overall impression of the ad – in particular, the text “use the coupon within 90 days from the day of issue in participating retailers to receive your free product”. We also understood that each product was limited to a total of 3,000 redemptions. We noted that neither the main copy of the ad nor the short-form terms and conditions at the bottom of the ad, made reference to the coupon availability. We therefore considered that participants did not have the opportunity to assess whether or not participation was worthwhile, since they would have purchased a qualifying washing machine without knowing if the 3,000-coupon limit per product had been reached. Whilst we understood that Persil had estimated the number of coupons likely to be redeemed and did not believe that the coupons would run out before the end of the promotion, we considered that, by its nature, limiting the number of redemptions meant it was possible that participants who had purchased one of the relevant Samsung washing machines would not be able to redeem the promotional items. Notwithstanding that, the Code prohibited encouraging participants to make a purchase as a precondition to applying for promotional items, if the number of those items were limited, unless the limitation was made sufficiently clear. Moreover, we understood that, once activated, the coupons would no longer be valid after 20 minutes, and we considered that represented a significant condition which was likely to affect a consumer’s understanding about how to participate in the promotion. Similarly, we noted that this was not mentioned in either the main part of the ad nor the short-form terms and conditions at the bottom of the page. We acknowledged that the stipulation was referenced in the full terms and conditions, which were accessible via a link within the ad. Despite that, we considered, given the information was a significant condition, the information should have been presented clearly in the ad itself to ensure consumers were able to understand how to participate in the promotion. Because the ad misleadingly stated that, participants would receive a free promotional item when that was not the case; it did not make clear that one of the products had to be purchased upfront or that there was a limited number of coupons available; and omitted a significant condition, we concluded that the ad was misleading and the promotion breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.23 (Free), and 8.12 and 8.17 (Promotional marketing).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Samsung Electronics (UK) Ltd and Unilever UK Ltd t/a Persil to ensure that they did not describe a promotional item as “free”, if consumers had to pay towards the cost of purchasing those items, and to make clear if those promotional items would have to be purchased upfront before being redeemed via a cashback mechanism. Furthermore, they should not encourage consumers to make a purchase or series of purchases as a precondition to applying for promotional items if the number of those items is limited, unless the limitation is made sufficiently clear at each stage for the consumer to assess accurately whether or not participation was worthwhile. We also told them to ensure that their future marketing communications referring to promotions included all significant conditions, where the omission of those conditions was likely to mislead.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/samsung-electronics--uk--ltd-a24-1252670-samsung-electronics--uk--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Wizz Air Hungary Ltd,,"A paid-for Google ad for airline Wizz Air, seen on 9 June 2024, stated “Fly Wizz Air – one of the greenest choices in air travel”.",The ASA challenged whether the claim “one of the greenest choices in air travel” was misleading.,"Wizz Air Hungary Ltd (Wizz Air) said it had committed billions of Euros to aiding the airline industry’s decarbonisation efforts. They operated the youngest and most carbon-efficient fleet in Europe, with an average age of 4.3 years. As a result, they had the lowest carbon emissions per passenger at 52 g carbon dioxide per revenue passenger kilometres (CO2/RPK). RPK was the number of seat kilometres flown by paying passengers – a figure that had been independently verified. They provided a copy of the report from which the figure had been taken. Wizz Air explained that they were actively renewing their fleet of aeroplanes – replacing the Airbus A320ceo aircraft with the Airbus A321neo, with a reduction in fuel consumption of 10% and a per-seat fuel improvement of 20%. The Airbus A321neo was the widest and most efficient single-aisle aircraft with the lowest fuel consumption per seat kilometre in its category. Additionally, the newer model gave a 50% reduction in noise compared to the older model. Wizz Air had invested in the research and development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). They were an equity investor in SAF, having invested in two companies developing the fuel, and had concluding offtake agreements to purchase SAF once it had been produced. They aimed to reach 10% SAF usage by 2030, exceeding the ReFuel EU Aviation Regulation requirements. They held membership of the Alliance for Zero Emission Aviation (AZEA) and the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuels Value Chain Industrial Alliance (RLCF) to ensure investment and deployment of future technologies in the field. As part of its environment, social and governance strategy (ESG) Wizz Air had established an independent Sustainability and Culture Committee and appointed a dedicated ESG Officer, who was a member of the senior leadership team. The independent Committee ensured the company took environmental issues into account when defining the Company’s strategy. As part of its duties, the Committee ensured Wizz Air’s statements on sustainability adhered to legislation, and that claims were verified by data, assurance and benchmarking.","The CAP Code stated that the basis of comparative claims such as ""greener"" or ""friendlier"" must be made clear. It also required that comparisons with identifiable competitors were verifiable and needed to include, or direct consumers to, sufficient information to allow them to understand the comparison, and be able to check the claims were accurate, or ask someone suitably qualified to do so. The ASA considered consumers would understand the claim “one of the greenest choices in air travel” in the ad as meaning that Wizz Air’s environmental impact was among the lowest of all the airlines operating flights to and from the UK. While we acknowledged that Wizz Air had based the claim on the type of aircraft they used, and the carbon emissions per passenger measured in CO2/RPK, that was not stated in the ad. Furthermore, the ad had not included information that would allow consumers to understand the comparison. Because the ad had not made clear the basis of the claim, or provided verifying information, we concluded it had breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.33, 3.35 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors), 11.1, and 11.3 (Environmental claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Wizz Air Hungary Ltd to ensure the basis of future comparative environmental claims was made clear and did not give a misleading impression of their flights’ environmental impact, and that ads provided sufficient information to enable consumers to verify comparisons with identifiable competitors or signposted consumers to such information.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/wizz-air-hungary-ltd-a24-1253458-wizz-air-hungary-ltd.html
"ASA Ruling on Aurum & Argenti Ltd t/a Bullion Club, bullionclub.co.uk","This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on unregulated investments. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid for Google ad for Bullion Club, a supplier of gold, seen in June 2024 stated, “… Gold Investments 2023 Gold Collectors Guide. Gold has historically held its value over time, making it a good hedge against inflation. Gold …”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad was misleading because it:,"1. Aurum & Argenti Ltd t/a Bullion Club said they understood the importance of informing potential investors that investments could vary. They explained that the ad was limited by space and led to a landing page that said, ""The value of investments is variable and can go down as well as up"" and “Aurum & Argenti is not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority”. They said the information was prominently and clearly displayed on the landing page. 2. Bullion Club agreed the need to clarify that past performance did not give a guide to the future. They said that their website stated, ""Past performance does not guarantee future performance"" alongside investment examples. They said they were willing to make changes to the disclaimer and had amended the landing page to make the information more prominent.","The CAP Code required that material information should not be omitted and should be presented clearly. The ASA understood that the gold investment market was not regulated within the UK, nor was it subject to the protections afforded by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service. We considered this to be material information that consumers required in order to make informed decisions about Bullion Club’s services. In addition, the Code stated marketing communications for investments should make clear that past performance or experience was not necessarily a guide for the future, and that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up. We noted that the ad contained no text stating that investments were variable and could go down as well as up or that gold investment was unregulated. We understood that the ad had led to a landing page on the Bullion Club’s website that had included text with information that the value of gold could fall and rise, and that they were not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. However, the relevant text was at the bottom of the page at the time the ad appeared. It therefore had not been immediately visible and consumers had to scroll a long way to the bottom of the page to locate it. While we understood from Bullion Club that a second similar explanation had been displayed more prominently on the landing page at the time the ad was originally seen, we had not seen evidence of that. The ad further stated, “Gold has historically held its value over time, making it a good hedge against inflation”. Therefore, it referred to the previous performance of gold and we considered that by referencing inflation, implied it would continue to do well in the future. We noted that the ad also contained no warning or further information to explain that past performance was not a guide for the future. We again understood that the landing page for the ad had included text that stated, “past performance is not a guide to future performance”, but that was also located at the bottom of the page at the time the ad appeared and was therefore not sufficiently prominent. We noted that changes had been made to the website. The risk warnings about gold being unregulated, that investments could go down as well as up and that past performance was not necessarily a guide for the future, were more prominent when viewing on a mobile device, although a consumer still had to scroll down on the desktop version. In any case, because at the time the ad was seen it did not include any risk warnings and the landing page had not presented that information immediately to consumers, we concluded that the ad was misleading. On those points the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification) and 14.4 and 14.5 (Financial products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form.

ASA Ruling on Fern Brady,,"A paid-for ad for comedian Fern Brady, seen on the Sky News website on 18 August. The ad contained an image with the text “FERN BRADY” at the top and “I GAVE YOU MILK TO DRINK” overlayed on a stained-glass window. The image contained a woman with Fern Brady’s face, holding a baby, and spraying milk directly from her partially obscured breast into the mouth of a kneeling holy figure.","The complainant challenged whether the ad was offensive, because they believed it mocked the Christian faith.","Fern Brady explained that the image in the ad was a direct recreation of the religious painting titled “The Lactation of St. Bernard”. That artwork, created in the 17th century by Spanish painter Alonso Cano, depicted the Virgin Mary nursing St. Bernard of Clairvaux by spraying milk from her breast into his mouth. The painting was well known within Christian art and had been widely accepted and respected within religious contexts for centuries. The ad creatively referenced that image, by using satire and humour as part of Fern Brady’s comedic brand. The intention was not to mock or belittle the original religious significance, but to offer a contemporary interpretation that aligned with her public persona as a comedian known for her irreverent style and her religious up-bringing. The text “I GAVE YOU MILK TO DRINK” overlayed a stained-glass window, which emphasised the artistic and cultural reference rather than aiming to offend. Efforts had been made to avoid any unintentional offence, in particular by covering Fern’s breast with a beam of light, which differed from the original painting. Fern Brady acknowledged that religious imagery was a sensitive area, and had approached the ad with the knowledge that the original painting was a respected piece of Christian art. However, humour was also subjective, and she believed while some may have found the portrayal distasteful, that did not necessarily mean it was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. Fern Brady believed that in the context of satire and artistic reenactment, the ad instead reflected a long tradition of artistic reinterpretation. Sky UK Ltd told us that the ad was not individually reviewed or cleared for use. They instead followed their standard processes whereby available advertising had to clear their advertiser and category block-lists, which the ad did. They were not aware of receiving any complaints directly.","The CAP Code stated that ads must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. Particular care must be taken to avoid causing offence on certain grounds, including religion or belief. We acknowledged Fern Brady’s comment that the ad was based on the religious painting titled “The Lactation of St. Bernard”, which we understood showed the miracle of Chatillon-sur-Seine, in which St. Bernard received divine grace from the Virgin Mary. We understood that the painting on which the image was based had been selected for comic effect. Because of the subject matter of Fern Brady’s material, the effect had been compounded by deviations from the original painting, such as her knowing the text “I GAVE YOU MILK TO DRINK”, a ray of light shining through a stained glass window and across her breast, and the more exaggerated presentation of the milk. Regardless of consumers’ familiarity with the painting, or the content of Fern Brady’s work, we considered the ad, which appeared on a general news website, was likely to be seen as depicting the Virgin Mary, a highly revered individual in the Christian tradition, breastfeeding an adult holy figure in a church setting, for the purposes of humour. In that context, we considered that the ad was likely to be seen as mocking the religious figures shown. We therefore concluded that it was likely to cause serious offence to some within the Christian faith who saw the ad on the site. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 4.1 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of, in media in which it was likely to cause serious offence. We told Fern Brady to take care to not cause offence on the grounds of religion in future ads.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/fern-brady-a24-1255841-fern-brady.html
ASA Ruling on Gold Warehouse Ltd t/a Gold Bank,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on unregulated investments, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA.","Three radio ads for Gold Bank, a gold dealing company, heard on LBC during July 2024: (a) The first ad said, “From Gold Bank London, the safe and sound way to buy gold. Part one security. It’s imperative your gold is of the highest grade and securely stored for the future. The gold refined by Gold Bank comes with fine scan technology ensuring our highest authenticity and traceability. It is kept safe to a world class grade five security standard. Gold Bank London kept safe, for your future and sound, with solid guidance. Visit goldbank.co.uk.” (b) The second ad said, “From Gold Bank London, the safe and sound way to buy gold. Part two. Not all gold is the same. Every gold bar or coin is unique, so it takes a gold expert to help you have faith in what you're buying. At Gold Bank, we have the knowledge and know how to make your gold buying experience a rewarding one. Gold Bank London, kept safe, for your future and sound, with solid guidance. Visit goldbank.co.uk.” (c) The third ad said, “If you're a gold buyer, you know you're safe with Gold Bank. At Gold Bank, safe is in our DNA. Feel safe in the knowledge that our unique fine scan technology ensures our highest authenticity in the gold we produce. Feel safe that your gold comes certified with a unique identifying serial number and feel safe that Gold Bank’s 30 years of experience means you can trust us in the recommendations we make. Visit goldbank.co.uk.”","The ASA challenged whether ads (a), (b) and (c) breached the Code because they implied that gold, which was an unregulated product, could have investment potential and this should not have been broadcast on a non-specialist radio station.","Gold Warehouse Ltd t/a Gold Bank said they did not present gold as an investment in their advertising. They also did not provide investment advice, but they ensured that they provided advice on the cost, process and security of gold when consumers bought their products. They said they targeted people who were interested in buying gold, precious metals or collectables for various reasons. For example, many Asian communities purchased gold for events such as Diwali and other special occasions. Other consumers bought special items as gifts and Gold Bank provided a link to the gift items section of their website. Radiocentre said they understood that gold was not to be considered as a “collectors’ item or other unregulated product or service that could have investment potential (in the colloquial sense)” and that BCAP Code rule 14.5.4 did therefore not apply. They believed that as long as the word “investment” or suggestion of investment potential were avoided, and that the purchase of gold was not framed as an investment in any way, which was the case in the ads, it was acceptable.","The BCAP Code stated that certain categories of advertisements may be broadcast on specialised financial channels, stations or programming only, such as those for investments not regulated or permitted under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA). An advertisement that implied, for example, that a collectors' item or other unregulated product or service could have investment potential (in the colloquial sense) would normally be unacceptable. The ASA acknowledged Gold Bank’s comments that gold was purchased as a collectable keepsake, and not only for its investment potential. However, we considered that the focus of ads (a), (b) and (c) was on gold which was purchased as an investment. Ad (b) referred to gold bars, which we considered would usually be purchased for investment potential. The ads also included claims such as, “It’s imperative your gold is of the highest grade”, “it takes a gold expert to help you have faith in what you're buying”, “the gold refined by Gold Bank comes with fine scan technology”, and “our unique fine scan technology ensures our highest authenticity in the gold we produce”. We considered those statements, along with references to the expertise of the advertiser, emphasised the investment potential of the gold sold by Gold Bank, given its type and quality. We also acknowledged Gold Bank’s comments that gold was purchased for cultural or special occasions. However, those reasons were not mentioned in any of the ads and there was otherwise no suggestion that the gold was being purchased to be given as a gift. Ads (a) and (b) featured the claims “securely stored for the future” and “kept safe, for your future”, and “make your gold buying experience a rewarding one”. We considered those claims further gave the impression that the purchase of gold was being presented as an investment opportunity which would provide financial returns in the future, in a similar way to money being invested in a traditional bank. Further to this, all the ads directed consumers to the advertiser’s website. The carousel homepage featured a page headed “Members”. At the bottom of that page were three options for ascending membership tiers where consumers could open an account when making purchases. Text for the Bronze level stated, “Starter Account. Where the investment journey begins”; for Silver, “Your gateway to investment beginnings and beyond”; and for Platinum, “Elevate your investment journey to unparalleled heights”. Further text stated, “Gold Bank is an investment gold company established over 30 years with headquarters in West London”. When the “Become a Member” link was clicked, text at the top of the page stated “Why not join the millions of savvy investors by utilizing our fast track rewards program to financial freedom”. We understood from this that Gold Bank offered an investment service, as suggested in ads (a), (b) and (c). We considered that the ads implied that gold, which was not regulated under FSMA, could have investment potential. The ads should therefore have been broadcast only on a specialised financial radio channel and because that was not the case, we concluded that the ads breached the Code. Ads (a), (b) and (c) breached BCAP Code rules 14.5 and 14.5.4 (Financial products, services and investments).","The ads must not be broadcast again in the form complained of on non-specialist stations. We told Gold Warehouse Ltd t/a Gold Bank to ensure that future ads which implied that gold, which was an unregulated product, could have investment potential were broadcast only on specialised financial stations.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/gold-warehouse-ltd-a24-1252738-gold-warehouse-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Gold Warehouse Ltd t/a Gold Bank,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on unregulated investments, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA.","A press ad by Gold Bank, seen on 18 May 2024, featured images of both sides of gold bullion. Text stated, “GOLD BANK LONDON RISE OF THE PHOENIX COULD THIS BE THE BEST INVESTMENT YOU’VE EVER MADE?”",The ASA challenged whether the ad was misleading because it failed to illustrate the risks of the investments.,"Gold Warehouse Ltd t/a Gold Bank said the claim, ""could this be the best investment you've ever made?"" was not making any claim that it was or was not the best investment to purchase the gold. It was just inviting the consumer to think about it by asking them the question. They said the claim could be amended instead to say something like, ""could this be the best-looking gold bar you've ever seen?”. They also said they could add additional text to their ad to say gold prices could be volatile and that the price of gold may go up as well as down.","The CAP Code required that material information should not be omitted and should be presented clearly. The ASA understood that the gold investment market was not regulated within the UK, nor was it subject to the protections afforded by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service. We considered that was likely to be material information that consumers required in order to make informed decisions about Gold Bank’s services. In addition the CAP Code required that marketing communications for investments should make clear that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up. The ad featured images of gold bullion, with text that stated, “Gold Bank […] could this be the best investment you’ve ever made?”. We considered consumers would understand from the ad that if they purchased the gold bullion, it would provide them with a significant return that could exceed alternative types of investment which they could make. We considered that because the gold bullion had been presented as an investment, the ad should have included text which stated that the value of investments could go down as well as up and that gold investment was unregulated. Because the ad did not include any risk warnings that the value of gold prices could go down as well as up, and that gold investment was an unregulated activity, we concluded it was misleading and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification) and 14.4 (Financial products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form.

ASA Ruling on Harrington & Byrne Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on unregulated investments, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A press ad by Harrington & Byrne, a coin retailer, seen on 30 May 2024, featured headline text which stated, “Own the brand new 2024 UK Gold Sovereign today” accompanied by images of both sides of the coin. Further text stated, “Struck in 22 Carat Gold […] The combination of precious metal content along with real long-term numismatic significance has made the Sovereign one of the most popular ways that you can own gold […] The even better news for collectors is that the 2024 UK Gold Sovereign is available VAT-Free and does not attract any Capital Gains Tax […] due to the constant fluctuations in the market, which has seen gold hit record highs in recent months, there is a real potential for sharp increases in price, we can only guarantee this price for 2 days.”",The ASA challenged whether the ad was misleading because it:,"1. & 2. Harrington & Byrne Ltd said that the ad had nothing to do with investment. At no point did they state that the UK Gold Sovereign was an investment vehicle or should be purchased as an investment and all the language used within the ad was factual only. They said by using the word fluctuation, by definition, they were stating that the market could go both up and down, which they believed was an accurate reflection of the gold market. Harrington & Byrne provided information in the form of graphs which they said showed the gold market over: 24 hours; a month; six months; annually; and over a decade. They said the information showed that the price of gold had increased by over 20% in the last 12 months. Despite that, they intentionally had not said that in the ad to avoid any contention that they were advertising the coin as an investment. They presented the coin as a piece for collectors, including the claim “The even better news for collectors”. The only reference to potential sharp increases in prices, was in relation to the retail price of the coin being guaranteed for only two days. They said that statements about the variability of investments, the gold being unregulated and that past performance did not necessarily give a guide for the future, were irrelevant for a coin that was being offered as a collectors’ piece; therefore, there was no reason to include them in the ad. They believed the ad complied with a complaint about a similar ad which was previously resolved informally by the ASA. However, they were willing to remove the claim “there is a real potential for sharp increases in price” and to make other amendments to the ad where necessary.","The CAP Code required that material information should not be omitted and should be presented clearly. The ASA understood that the gold investment market was not regulated within the UK, nor was it subject to the protections afforded by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service. We considered this was likely to be material information that consumers required in order to make informed decisions about Harrington & Byrne’s services. In addition, the CAP Code further required that marketing communications for investments made clear that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up. They should also make clear that past performance or experience did not necessarily give a guide for the future. If they were used in marketing communications, examples of past performance or experience should not be unrepresentative.We acknowledged that the ad referred to the Gold Sovereign coin as having “numismatic significance” and as being “for collectors”. However, the ad featured the claim, “due to the constant fluctuations in the market, which has seen gold hit record highs in recent months there is a real potential for sharp increases in price”. While fluctuations could mean that retail prices of the coin were variable, we considered that consumers would primarily have understood from the claim that positive fluctuations in the gold market had caused gold prices to rise and they would continue to rise. The claim therefore suggested it was a good time for consumers to purchase the coin to take advantage of the future successes of gold and therefore it was presented as an investment. We also considered the claim that the coin “does not attract any Capital Gains Tax” further added to the overall impression that the coin was being presented primarily as an investment purchase. However, the ad did not include any text which stated that the value of investments could go down as well as up or that gold investment was unregulated. The ad further stated that high gold prices had been the pattern of recent months. Therefore, it made a reference to past performance of gold, but there was nothing in the ad that explicitly stated past experience was not a guide for the future. Because the ad did not include any risk warning to make clear that the value of gold investments could go down as well as up, that it was an unregulated activity and did not make clear that past performance was not necessarily a guide for the future, we concluded it was misleading and breached the Code. On points 1 and 2 the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification), 14.4 and 14.5 (Financial products).","The ad must not appear again in its current form.

ASA Ruling on Solomon Global Ltd t/a Buy Bullion,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on unregulated investments. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid for Facebook ad for Solomon Global, a supplier of gold and silver, seen in June 2024 stated, “At times, it can be overwhelming to understand the gold market. With Buy Bullion, you’ll gain the knowledge and guidance you need to make successful investments”. Further text on a gold background said, “Earn 10-12%. PA How to Invest in Gold. Download Your Free Guide”. Text at the bottom of the ad said, “Request our 2024 Gold Report. Gold has averaged 11.5% per annum for the last 20 years”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad was misleading because it:,"1. & 2. Solomon Global Ltd explained that they had previously been given legal advice and were told the sale of physical gold was not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and ads for their product would not be considered a financial promotion. Similarly, they had been advised that using the word “investment” in their ads did not cause them to be considered financial promotions under the FCA’s rules. They further confirmed that they did not hold or manage their client’s funds for the purpose of investing. They stated that physical gold, like other tangible products such as art, luxury watches, cars, art and antiques, were purchased by collectors, as gifts and for investment. However, none were considered financial products that needed risk warnings. An ad for a luxury watch, for example, would not need to warn consumers that purchasing it would not allow them access to the Financial Ombudsman or the Financial Service Compensation Scheme. They said further, to include such a risk warning for their products could mislead consumers into believing they offered financial products or services when that was not the case. They also stated that as far as they were aware no other advertisers offering similar products included such risk warnings in their ads. They said that the landing page the ad linked to on their website did include risk warnings that stated precious metals could be volatile and their value may go down as well as up. However, they said that on receiving the complaint they had removed the ad, and any similar ads, and conducted an audit into all their advertising. In future, they would also be taking further steps to ensure their ads complied with the CAP Code. That would include text that highlighted the risk and volatility of precious metals and that historical performance did not give a guide to the future. They acknowledged that in isolation the ad did need further clarification, stating that investments could go down as well as up and that past performance did not necessarily give a guide to the future.","The CAP Code required that material information should not be omitted and should be presented clearly. The ASA understood that the physical gold investment market was not regulated within the UK, nor was it subject to the protections afforded by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service. We considered that to be material information that consumers required in order to make informed decisions about Solomon Global’s services. In addition, the Code stated marketing communications for investments should make clear that past performance or experience did not necessarily give a guide for the future, and that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up. We noted that the ad stated, “With Buy Bullion, you’ll gain the knowledge and guidance you need to make successful investments” and “How to Invest in Gold”. Therefore, it promoted gold as an investment, not a gift or as a collector’s item, but it contained no text stating that investments were variable and could go up and down or that gold investment was unregulated. We understood that the ad had led to a landing page on the Solomon Global website that had included text about the volatility of precious metal prices, but not that it was unregulated. In addition, the relevant text was at the bottom of the page and relatively small, therefore it was not immediately visible and consumers would have had to scroll a long way to the bottom of the page to locate it. The landing page had been updated to include another risk warning that precious metals could go down as well as up. While that information appeared higher up the page than the original text – approximately halfway down the page – it was still not prominent and consumers had to scroll down to find it. The ad further stated, “Gold has averaged 11.5% per annum for the last 20 years”. Therefore, it referred to the previous performance of gold and we considered the implication from the ad was that it would continue to perform in the same way in the future. We noted however that the ad contained no information to explain that past performance was not a guide for the future. We understood further that the landing page the ad linked to also contained no relevant warning. While we acknowledged the changes proposed by Solomon Global, because the ad did not include risk warnings to make clear that gold investment was unregulated, that investments could go down as well as up and that past performance did not necessarily give a guide for the future, plus the landing page did not present that information immediately to consumers, we concluded that it was misleading.

ASA Ruling on Stirling Health Ltd,,"A press ad for Collagen Prime Cream, seen on 29 May 2024. The heading stated, “My joints feel great thanks to Prime Cream” with the subheading “Collagen is essential for good joint health”. Text below the photo stated, “For those who suffer from: -Joint Pain -Stiff back, hands, hips, wrists, knees -Arthritis”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad made medicinal claims for an unauthorised product.,Stirling Health Ltd t/a Collagen Prime Cream confirmed that they would stop using the ad.,"The CAP Code stated that medicinal claims and indications may be made for a medicinal product that was authorised by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A medicinal claim was a claim that a product or its constituent(s) could be used with a view to make a medical diagnosis or could treat or prevent disease, including an injury, ailment or adverse condition, whether of body or mind, in human beings. The ASA assessed the claims: “My joints feel great thanks to Prime Cream”; “Collagen is essential for good joint health”; and “For those who suffer from: -Joint Pain -Stiff back, hands, hips, wrists, knees -Arthritis”. The claims were presented as the testimonial from a 62-year-old woman. We considered that consumers would understand those claims to mean that Collagen Prime Cream could relieve joint pain and stiffness, including when they occurred as symptoms of arthritis. We therefore considered that those were medicinal claims which required the product to be authorised as a medicine. However, we understood that the cream did not have the relevant marketing authorisation from the MHRA and because of that no medicinal claims could be made for the product. Because the ad made medicinal claims for a product which was not authorised, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 12.1 and 12.11 (Medicines, health devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

Invest in tax-free gold with competitive rates, buy-back guarantee and first-class service. As specialist brokers, we understand the market and your reasons for invest…”.",The ASA challenged whether the ads were misleading because they failed to illustrate the risks of the investments.,"The Pure Gold Group Ltd t/a The Pure Gold Company stated that their service differed from most of their competitors as they did not sell products directly from their website. The website acted as an educational tool. It also put consumers in touch with their brokers who provided expert guidance based on an individual’s circumstances and investment aims. They said Google ads were limited in space and should be considered in the wider context of the landing page to which the ads linked. They confirmed that the landing page, and every page on their website stated, “Users should understand the market rate for gold / silver can go down as well as up”. They said that as a result of the complaint they had also added, “Past performance does not necessarily indicate future performance” to the website.They explained that the landing page now also included a boxed section where claims related to gold’s investment performance were immediately qualified with the text “** The value of gold like any investment is variable and can go down as well as up. Past performance does not necessarily indicate future performance.” They positioned the second warning near to the first reference on that page to the investment performance of gold, which they believed was the most suitable location because it was the first time consumers would think about investment outcomes. It was presented in clear language and font, and was asterisked to relevant text that mentioned how much gold had appreciated in the last ten years. They also said that the landing page featured free guides about gold investment. Those guides, in conjunction with the professional guidance provided by their brokers, the fact you couldn’t buy directly from their website and the qualifying text meant that as a whole the ads made clear that investments were variable. They said they were unaware of any other advertiser making statements relating to being unregulated for a physical product or that they were required to do so. They explained that consumers were aware of when a company was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) because those companies had to include those details on their website and in any documentation. In addition, consumers could search for the company on the FCA register. They said that while physical gold was not regulated, financial advice was, and they were very clear on their website that they did not offer financial advice. They were also clear on their website and when they spoke to clients that they were not regulated by the FCA. They said further that consumers who had products with regulated firms did have access to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which offered recompense when those authorised firms were unable to pay consumers. They explained that was not relevant to physical gold, because the customer took ownership of the physical product. Therefore, if their business failed it would make no difference to the value of the consumer’s holdings. They stated therefore that while they agreed material information should be presented clearly, for the reasons given they did not believe that their product being unregulated was material information.","The CAP Code required that material information should not be omitted and should be presented clearly.The ASA understood that the gold investment market was not regulated within the UK, nor was it subject to the protections afforded by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service.

ASA Ruling on Great Grass MCR Ltd t/a Great Grass,,"A poster for Great Grass, an artificial grass supplier, seen in July 2024, featured an image of a woman’s torso and upper legs. She was wearing flesh-coloured underwear and held a potted plant in front of her crotch. She held scissors in her other hand. Headline text stated, “No trimming needed! [wink emoji]”.",,"Great Grass MCR t/a Great Grass said the ad had been on display for several months and had therefore been seen by hundreds of thousands of people. They believed that, because there had been only one complaint, most of those who saw it were not offended by the ad. They said they had in fact received 47 positive comments about it. They believed the ad generated business because people found it amusing and memorable. Great Grass believed it was wrong to assume that the person featured in the ad was a woman when it could equally be a man or a transgender person. They said it made no mention of women or sex, nor did it show any obvious female sexual features. 75Media, the media owner, said the ad was already on display when they took over the poster site in July 2024. They said they took the ASA’s concerns very seriously and would remove the ad immediately if it was found to breach the CAP Code.","Upheld The ASA considered that those who saw the ad would interpret the image as featuring a woman, due to her slim waist, curved hips, slim arms and lack of obvious body hair. The model was dressed only in flesh-coloured underwear, which we considered was intended to suggest that she was nude. The image was cropped from the chest down, so her face could not be seen. The model held a pot plant in front of her crotch, with scissors posed as if to trim the plant. We considered that those elements made the model’s groin area the dominant focus of the ad. The ad stated, “No trimming needed!” We considered that, alongside the image of the pot plant placed over the groin area, the text would be understood as an allusion both to pruning a plant and to trimming pubic hair. The ad appeared in an untargeted medium. We considered that the tone was not overly sexual and that the image was not explicit. We acknowledged that many would see it as a light-hearted reference to the low maintenance properties of artificial grass. We considered, however, that the cropped image of a woman in underwear accompanied by text that alluded to pubic hair had the effect of demeaning and objectifying women by using their genitalia to draw attention to an unrelated product. We considered that the emoji next to the text, which featured a winking face with its tongue out, added to the degrading and mocking tone. Because we considered the ad objectified women, we further considered it was likely to cause serious and widespread offence and included a gender stereotype in a way that was likely to cause harm. We concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Great Grass MCR Ltd t/a Great Grass to ensure their future ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious or widespread offence, including by featuring a harmful gender stereotype by objectifying women.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/great-grass-mcr-ltd-a24-1257296-great-grass-mcr-ltd.html

Offers are available on selected apartments only and will be paid on completion. *The Stamp Duty offer does not include any additional or incremental Stamp Duty payments payable by investors or those who will result in owning more than one home as a result of this purchase or any additional Stamp Duty payable by overseas purchasers. **50% service charge will be discounted at the rate applicable at the point of reservation and deducted from the completion statement. Purchasers must complete by 30th June 2024. We reserve the right to extend, reintroduce or amend any such offer as we see fit at any time. Prices correct at time of print. Please speak to our sales team for more information.”",The ASA challenged whether the: 1. conditions of the promotion had been made sufficiently clear; and 2. ad misleadingly omitted information regarding the price for the service charge.,"1. Pegasus Homes Ltd said Fitzjohn’s was a luxury, boutique development of 29 apartments located in Hampstead and exclusively for those aged over 55 years. They said the buyer demographic was typically wealthy retirees with generational and acquired wealth, and that all purchasers at Fitzjohn’s to date had been cash purchasers and who were not reliant on selling a property to complete the purchase. They said the promotion offered customers a choice between having their Stamp Duty Land tax paid, having a 5% discount off the purchase price or 50% off the service charge for 10 years. They said to help customers make a choice, the sales team informed them of the likely best financial deal for each apartment. The ad included a qualification that stated, “Terms and conditions apply. Offers are available on selected apartments only and will be paid on completion. Purchasers must complete by 30th June 2024. We reserve the right to extend, reintroduce or amend any such offer as we see fit at any time. Prices correct at time of print. Please speak to our sales team for more information.” The closing date was clearly stated, and they believed the qualification was sufficient in communicating applicable conditions and restrictions. They accepted that the text size of the qualification was smaller than the main body copy, but considered it was still clearly legible.There was also a direct web link, QR code and phone number for customers to access alternative sources of information where conditions of the promotion were stated. Additionally, when customers enquired with the sales team and visited the sales suite, the incentive details and any terms that applied were discussed in detail. If the customer went ahead and utilised the incentive, there was an addendum to their reservation contract that gave details on the incentive and any terms that applied. They provided a copy of that wording. 2. Pegasus Homes said the service charge price depended on the apartment customers wished to purchase. It was calculated on a pound per square foot basis. As each apartment differed in size, the service charge price would also differ. The service charge for each apartment was included in the price list which was given to customers at the point of enquiry and discussed by the sales team.They said the current service charge for Fitzjohn’s was £14.52 per square foot, but that it could increase or decrease each year. The price of the service charge was not omitted to mislead customers. It was not included, however, because the concept of a service charge was difficult to portray to customers who would have most likely lived in a freehold property for all of their lives. They said they preferred to discuss the specifics of the service charge with their customers in person.","1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that all marketing communications or other material referring to promotions must communicate all applicable significant conditions or information where the omission of such conditions or information was likely to mislead, including a prominent closing date if applicable. The ASA considered consumers would understand from the claim, “Simply choose from one of our three exclusive offers […] Option 1: Stamp Duty paid* Option 2: Save 5% off the asking price Option 3: 50% off the service charge for 10 years**” that if they purchased a Fitzjohn’s apartment, they would qualify for one of those offers.The ASA understood that to be eligible for one of those offers, consumers had to have completed the purchase of an apartment by 30 June 2024.We acknowledged that the ad stated, “Purchasers must complete by 30th June 2024”. However, we considered this wording appeared in very small text at the bottom of the ad, and therefore it could be overlooked. We considered that the duration of the promotional period and the speed at which it was necessary to complete the sale of the property was information likely to influence consumers’ understanding of, and decisions about, the promotion. They were therefore significant conditions which should have been stated prominently in the ad. Additionally, because the asterisk that linked to that wording was only alongside the claim that related to receiving 50% off the service charge for 10 years (option 3), and not the offers about having the Stamp Duty paid or 5% off the asking price, which came before it, it was therefore ambiguous as to whether the terms and conditions, including the closing date specified in the small text, applied to all three promotional options. We acknowledged that the small text stated, “Terms and Conditions apply. Offers are available on selected apartments only […] Please speak to our sales team” alongside a QR code, website and telephone number. Notwithstanding that we considered the text was small and could be overlooked, we understood that the QR code and website were not specific to where the terms and conditions could be found. We had not seen the full terms and conditions of the promotion. We understood that to be eligible for 50% off the service charge for 10 years or 5% off the asking price, consumers had to have two weeks in between exchanging contracts and completing on the sale of the property. We considered that was a significant condition which was likely to affect consumers’ understanding of the promotion and their decision to participate. We therefore considered the omission of significant conditions from the ad was likely to mislead. We concluded that because the ad had omitted significant conditions, including a prominent closing date, the ad breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.17, 8.17.1, 8.17.4 and 8.17.4.a (Promotional marketing). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that quoted prices must include non-optional taxes, duties, fees and charges that apply to all or most buyers. It also stated that if a tax, duty, fee or charge could not be calculated in advance, for example, because it depended on the consumer's circumstances, the marketing communication must make clear that it was excluded from the advertised price and state how it was calculated. We understood that the service charge was a non-optional, ongoing fee for maintenance of the Fitzjohn’s development. We acknowledged that because the service charge was calculated on a pound per square foot basis and the apartments varied in size, the price depended on the apartment a customer wished to purchase.We noted that Pegasus Homes preferred to discuss the service charge with customers in person. However, the ad contained no information about the price of the service charge or how it was calculated, such as the price per square foot. We also understood that the price of the service charge was subject to an annual review. Although we acknowledged that the ad included the “Buy from” price, we considered the price of the service charge was material information of which consumers should also have been made aware.Because the service charge was a non-optional fee which had been excluded from the ad, and because the ad did not make clear that it was excluded or how the charge was calculated, we concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.18 and 3.19 (Prices).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Pegasus Homes Ltd to ensure that their future promotions communicated all applicable significant conditions or information, including a prominent closing date, where the omission of such information was likely to mislead consumers.

See also related rulings published on 13 November 2024.","A national newspaper ad published on 27 April 2024 for Pegasus Homes, a retirement property company, included text that stated, “Try before you buy with Pegasus Rent-to-Buy Experience the joy of a new Pegasus later living home, without the wait”. Further text stated, “Once you’re ready Purchase within 12 months and get 9 months [sic] rent back* or Receive 5% off the asking price”.

Offers are available on selected apartments only. *The rent-to-buy tenancy must start by 30th June 2024 and your rental cashback will be refunded on purchase completion […]”.",,"Pegasus Homes Ltd said the ‘Rent to Buy’ scheme gave customers the opportunity to try living in one of their communities before deciding whether to purchase the property. If, at the end of the 12 months of renting the property, they decided to purchase the property, there was a financial benefit whereby they received nine months’ rental value off the purchase price. If they did not want to proceed at the end of the 12 months, they could give one month’s notice to vacate the property and development without any contractual obligation to purchase the property.

The ASA understood that to be eligible to receive a refund of nine months’ rent, consumers had to have started their rental tenancy by 30 June 2024. We acknowledged that the ad stated, “The rent-to-buy tenancy must start by 30th June 2024”.

They were therefore significant conditions which should have been stated prominently in the ad.

Further text stated, “Hear-pods are far more comfortable than normal hearing devices […] when in reality you are listening to every single word and sound around you […]”, “I can hear things I hadn’t heard before […] I can hear conversations, so sharp and clear […]” and “Hears a whisper from 30 metres away”.",,,"Upheld The CAP Code stated medicinal or medical claims and indications could only be made for a medicinal product that was licensed by the MHRA, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. In addition, the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 required that a medical device should be registered with the MHRA before it was placed on the market in Great Britain.The ad included claims such as “Boost your hearing with NEW Hear-Pods”, “Do you struggle to hear the TV?”, “Our NEW Hear-Pods will enable you to listen to the TV, at the volume you want, without having to turn it up too high”, “You will hear everything that is being said, crystal clear, even 30 metres away” and “Hear-Pods are far more comfortable than normal hearing devices that you insert into or behind your ears”. The ASA considered that the overall impression of the ad was that Hear-Pods could be used as an alternative to other types of hearing aids and could alleviate hearing loss. We therefore considered that the ad made medical claims, which required that the product met the requirements for medical devices. We understood that the product was not registered with the MHRA, nor had we seen evidence that the Hear-Pods had the appropriate conformity marking. Therefore, no medical claims could be made for the product. Because the ad made such claims, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.10 (Legality) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form.

ASA Ruling on Supreme CBD Ltd t/a Supreme CBD,,"A post on Anthony Fowler’s X page, seen on 21 July 2024 for Supreme CBD. Mr Fowler promoted a discount code for CBD products and said, “A lot of people message me saying ‘I want to try CBD, I don’t know where to start, I’m quite scared to spend money in case it doesn’t work.’ […] It will work, for everyone, because we all have the same system called [sic] endocannabinoid system which works with cannabinoids, like CBD. It’s the reason we’re so popular. Most […] supplements, you take it, you don’t feel any different. With CBD after, like, a few days, you feel a big difference. Then you really, really get the benefits.”",,,"Upheld The ASA noted that Anthony Fowler believed he was simply providing his personal opinion on his personal social media account. However, Anthony Fowler was the owner of Supreme CBD and the post’s content related to Supreme CBD. The post was therefore an ad for Supreme CBD, and any claims must comply with the CAP Code. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food, or ingredient, and health. References to general benefits of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health-related well-being could be used in marketing communications, if they were accompanied by a specific health claim authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register) in relation to the relevant nutrient or food. We considered that consumers would understand the claims “It will work, for everyone, because we all have the same system called [sic] endocannabinoid system which works with cannabinoids, like CBD” and “Most […] supplements, you take it, you don’t feel any different. With CBD after, like, a few days, you feel a big difference. Then you really, really get the benefits” to imply that the CBD in the product would be generally beneficial to health and well-being. The claims must therefore be accompanied by a specific authorised health claim for CBD. However, the ad did not include any authorised claims. Furthermore, we noted there were no authorised health claims for CBD on the GB Register. We concluded that the claims breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1, 15.2 and 15.7 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Supreme CBD Ltd and Anthony Fowler not to make any general or specific health claims about CBD, until such time as a health claim was authorised on the GB Register in relation to CBD.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/supreme-cbd-ltd-a24-1253019-supreme-cbd-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Vintage Associates Fine Wine Merchants Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on unregulated investments. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","Two paid for social media ads seen in June 2024 for Vintage Associates, a wine investment company: a. A Facebook ad stated, “Discover the stability of wine investment. One of the most stable investments on the market. Inflation and recession resistant for a secure investment journey. Proven growth: Up 600% in the last 20 years…Secure Your Future: Invest in the stability and resilience of fine wine…”. An accompanying video featured a man explaining where Vintage Associates’ wines were sourced from. He stated, “We deal with five key wine making regions. Those being Bourdeaux and Burgundy in France. And also Italy, California and Champagne … those historically have always been the best performing wines on behalf of our clients.” b. A LinkedIn ad stated, “Learn to invest… without risking your future”. The ad featured a picture of a wine cask. Text adjacent to the cask stated, “BUILD YOUR COLLECTION OF AGEING FINE WINE. BOUGHT FOR (24/05/2021) £6,550. SOLD FOR (04/05/2022) £11,000 RETURN 67.94% IN ONE YEAR”. Further text at the bottom of the ad stated, “Fine wine has shown average returns of 12% p.a for over 40 years. The longer you hold a wine for, the more rare it becomes. It’s this rarity that improves the value of your current holdings...”.","The ASA challenged whether ads (a) and (b) were misleading because they: 1. failed to illustrate the risk of the investments; and 2. did not make clear that past performance, examples of which must be representative, did not necessarily give a guide for the future. 3. The ASA further challenged whether the claim “Proven growth: Up 600% in the last 20 years” in ad (a) could be substantiated and was misleading.","1. Vintage Associates Fine Wine Merchants Ltd t/a Vintage Associates acknowledged that the ad did not explicitly state that investments could go down as well as up or that the product was unregulated. They explained that it was always discussed at client consultations but going forward all future advertisements would outline the risk. 2. Vintage Associates said that the examples of past performance in ads (a) and (b) were based on factual information. The references in ad (a) to “Proven growth: Up 600% in the last 20 years” and “historically have always been the best performing wines” were supported by the Liv-ex Burgundy 150 index. The claim in ad (b) that “Fine wine has shown average returns of 12% p.a for over 40 years” came from the Liv-ex Fine Wine Investable Index which had shown considerable growth since 1988. In addition, the reference in ad (b) to the bottle of wine that sold for £11,000 was in relation to a bottle of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, La Tache. However, they acknowledged that both ads had not included an explanation that past performance was not an indication of future results.3. Vintage Associates said the claim “Proven growth: Up 600% in the last 20 years” was based on the Liv-ex Burgundy 150 index which had shown a 578% growth since 2004.","1. & 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that material information should not be omitted and should be presented clearly. The ASA understood that the wine investment market was not regulated within the UK, nor was it subject to the protections afforded by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service. We considered that this was material information that consumers required in order to make informed decisions about Vintage Associates’ services. In addition, marketing communications for investments should make clear that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up, and that past performance or experience did not necessarily give a guide for the future. Ad (a) stated, “Discover the stability of wine investment. One of the most stable investments on the market. Inflation and recession resistant for a secure investment journey” and ad (b) said, “Learn to invest… without risking your future”. However, they contained no information stating that investments were variable and could go down as well as up or that wine investment was unregulated. Ad (a) further stated, “Proven growth: Up 600% in the last 20 years …” and “… those historically have always been the best performing wines on behalf of our clients”. Ad (b) said, “Fine wine has shown average returns of 12% p.a for over 40 years”, and included an example of wine that was bought for £6,550 and sold for £11,000 within one year. Therefore, the ads referred to the previous performance of wine and we considered the implication from the ads was that it was likely to perform in the same way in the future. We noted however that the ads contained no information to explain that past performance was not a guide for the future. In addition, while we understood from Vintage Associates that Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, La Tache had sold for £11,000 in 2021, we had seen no evidence that the sale was a representative one. Because the ads did not include any risk warnings to make clear that wine investment was unregulated, that investments could go down as well as up or that past performance did not necessarily give a guide for the future and referenced an example of past performance that was unrepresentative, we concluded they were misleading. On those points the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification) and 14.4 and 14.5 (Financial products). 3. Upheld The CAP Code stated that before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers were likely to regard as objective and that were capable of objective substantiation. Ad (a) stated, “Proven growth: Up 600% in the last 20 years …”. The accompanying video mentioned that Vintage Associates dealt with wines in five regions, Bourdeaux, Burgundy, Champagne, Italy and California, without referring to any specific wines. Therefore, we considered that consumers were likely to understand from the ad that wines in general in those five areas had grown by 600% in the last 20 years.The information provided by Vintage Associates, the Liv-ex Burgundy 150 index, referred to selected wines from Burgundy having grown by 578% since 2004. However, the source of the information considered the last ten vintages across 15 Burgundy brands and not Burgundy wines in general. It also did not relate to wines in any of the other regions referred to in the ad. Therefore, because we considered consumers were likely to understand the claim to refer to all wines in the five regions mentioned in the ad, and the evidence only referred to a select number of wines from Burgundy, we concluded that the claim had not been substantiated and was misleading. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1(Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained about.

ASA Ruling on Vinverum Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on unregulated investments. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Facebook ad published by Simply Invest UK for Vinverum, a wine investment company, seen in June 2024, stated, “Transform Your Portfolio with Fine Wine Investment”. A caption on the post stated, “Delve into the world of fine wine investment with our exclusive guide. Inside, discover: The lucrative advantages of fine wine investment. Expert strategies for crafting a tailored wine portfolio. Proven tips for maximising returns on your fine wine collection. And valuable insights to refine your investment approach. Act now – download your free guide.”",The ASA challenged whether: 1. the ad was misleading because it failed to illustrate the risks of the investments; and 2. the claim “proven tips for maximising returns on your fine wine collection” was misleading and could be substantiated.,"1. Vinverum Ltd said that fine wine was an unregulated product and that they understood that they were not subject to Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulations. They said the ad did not refer to specific returns an individual could make and that they simply claimed that wine could be profitable. Simply Media Manchester Ltd t/a Simply Invest UK acknowledged that the ad could have been clearer. They said that they understood that fine wine was not regulated by the FCA, but considered they had acted responsibly. 2. Vinverum said the purpose of the claim “proven tips for maximising returns on your fine wine collection” was to advise wine investors to consider only investing in the top traded wine brands in the world. They said the Liv-Ex 1000 index, which tracked the price performance of the top 1,000 wine brands traded on the platform, had grown by 285.5% over the last 20 years.Simply Invest UK said that Vinverum were experienced in assisting their clients when investing in fine wine. They said details of the advice Vinverum would typically give was not included in the ad because that was information they would provide exclusively to their clients.","1. Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications for investments made clear that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up. The CAP Code further stated that material information should not be omitted and should be presented clearly. The ASA understood that wine investment was currently not regulated in the UK, nor was it subject to the protections afforded by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or the Financial Ombudsman Service. We considered that this was material information that consumers required in order to make informed decisions about Vinverum’s services. The ad stated, “Delve into the world of fine wine investment […] The lucrative advantages of fine wine investment. Expert strategies for crafting a tailored wine portfolio”. However, it contained no text stating that investments were variable and could go down as well as up, or that fine wine investment was unregulated. Because the ad did not make clear that wine investment was unregulated, and that investments could go down as well as up, we concluded it was misleading.

Upheld The CAP Code stated that before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers were likely to regard as objective and that were capable of objective substantiation. The ASA considered that consumers were likely to interpret the claim “proven tips for maximising returns on your fine wine collection” to mean that the advice they received from Vinverum would allow them to ensure the value of their investments performed optimally. We considered that because Vinverum’s tips were “proven”, and because they related to “maximising returns”, consumers were likely to consider that those investments were likely to substantially increase. We also considered the phrase “lucrative advantages” further added to that impression. We therefore expected to see robust evidence that demonstrated that the claim could be substantiated, in relation to fine wine investments. We acknowledged that the Liv-ex Fine Wine 1000 indicated that the 1,000 wines which had been tracked had increased in value by 7% overall within the five-year period captured. However, we also noted that within that timeframe, the overall value of wine had gone down as well as up. For example, the wines had decreased in value by 18.8% in the last two years. We therefore considered that evidence was insufficient to substantiate that investments in fine wine, through “proven” tips, were likely to substantially increase. Because we had not seen sufficient evidence to support the claim “proven tips for maximising returns on your fine wine collection”, we concluded it had not been substantiated. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

The CurrencyWave website made numerous references to the fact that CurrencyCloud conducted the payment services and they believed it clearly stated that the service was powered by CurrencyCloud.When signing up to the service, the clients’ contract was with CurrencyCloud which was made clear through the online onboarding process and terms and conditions. CurrencyWave provided an example of the email their clients received when they signed up, which they believed made clear the client’s relationship with both CurrencyWave and CurrencyCloud. Currencycloud required its introducer-brokers like CurrencyWave, to share with it for review and/or approval marketing materials prior to launch or publication.When a client applied for an online account and signed up to the CurrencyCloud terms and conditions, CurrencyCloud would then perform due diligence and identification checks; any additional information was requested from the client by CurrencyWave. Once the account was approved, the client received details for setting up password credentials and would be able to use the platform to conduct payment services. They would also have access to the CurrencyWave helpline and support if they needed assistance. Each page of the website contained the following statement: “For clients based in the United Kingdom and rest of the world, payment services for CurrencyWave are provided by The Currency Cloud Limited”.CurrencyCloud said they were an e-money institution authorised by the FCA and CurrencyWave was one of their foreign exchange introducer-brokers. Under their arrangement, CurrencyWave maintained the end-client relationships day-to-day and they could submit orders and instructions on customers behalf to CurrencyCloud, who provided regulated payments and e-wallets to customers. CurrencyWave handled customers online accounts and transactions as the appointed authorised person. Currencywave was involved in the facilitation of a service that Currencycloud ultimately provided, and they did not believe that the marketing of such arrangements was misleading, although they accepted that clarification may be helpful. In practice, the customers agreed a trade with the foreign exchange introducer-broker, who then booked the trade on CurrencyCloud’s platform on behalf of the end client, and CurrencyCloud executed the trade. They said the arrangement was common across the industry and were aware of other firms which operated similar arrangements with similar marketing practices. They had reviewed CurrencyWave’s website and found instances of language that was not in line with their marketing policies and had worked closely with CurrencyWave to update the language and bring it in line with their policies.CurrencyCloud said the qualification “payment services for CurrencyWave are provided by The Currency Cloud Limited”, was in line with broader financial industry practice and they were aware of a number of other financial institutions that operated on the same basis. They had had engagement with the FCA regarding their arrangements with foreign exchange introducer-brokers. Their interactions with the FCA had focussed on ensuring the language on introducer-broker websites was not misleading in a number of ways, and the placement and size of the disclosures in isolation had not to date, been raised as a concern. They were aware of a number of finance companies with similar types of arrangements, using similar language on their websites, who used multiple regulated e-money or payment service providers. They believed their approach was an acceptable one across the industry and they had not seen anything to the contrary from the FCA. 2. The animated video on the home page of their website made clear the relationship between CurrencyWave and CurrencyCloud. It made one reference to payment services where it said, “Your payment will be sent through a fully FCA authorised platform”. It did not say ‘our’ or ‘CurrencyWave’s’ fully FCA authorised platform, but it referred to a fully FCA authorised platform. The following statement was also on each page of the website “The Currency Cloud Limited is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority under the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 for the issuing of electronic money”. Further text on the home page stated, “FCA Regulated E-Money Partner” which they believed made it clear that payments and funds were processed by their E-Money partner, CurrencyCloud.Neither the video nor the website stated that CurrencyWave was FCA authorised. It was made clear that payment services were provided by CurrencyCloud, who were the FCA regulated entity. Furthermore, when accessing the ‘About Us’ page of their website, they made clear the relationship between CurrencyWave and CurrencyCloud. It stated, “Payment services for CurrencyWave are provided by CurrencyCloud, a leading payment provider and a subsidiary of Visa Inc. Currencycloud is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) […] Client funds are safeguarded by our FCA-regulated e-money partners in segregated accounts at tier one banks. In the unlikely event of Currencycloud ceasing to exist, your money remains protected.” When clients applied for an account, it was made clear that they were entering into a contract with CurrencyCloud, not CurrencyWave as in the terms and conditions. They believed that taking into account all the information provided to the client, it was clear who was FCA authorised and what CurrencyWave’s relationship to CurrencyCloud was.3. CurrencyWave said exchange rates were dynamic and subject to continuous change which was why they stated on the cost comparison table the date on which the data was collected and compared. They believed that consumers would be able to ascertain from the date given in the comparison that the information was historic, intended only as a guide, and did not constitute a real time comparison. They said they obtained data from some competitors directly from their websites and for others via a personal banking app.CurrencyWave said they were in the process of re-developing their website and ahead of that they had removed the animated video and the cost comparison table.","1.Upheld The ASA understood that CurrencyWave acted as an introducer for CurrencyCloud and that it was CurrencyCloud that handled all the foreign exchange payments and financial transactions. We considered it was material information for consumers to be aware that their contract for the provision of financial services was with CurrencyCloud and not CurrencyWave.At the top of the webpage, the ad featured the claims “CURRENCYWAVE SMARTER GLOBAL PAYMENTS”, “Transparent pricing, secure transactions”. The cost comparison table gave the cost of sending money with CurrencyWave. Further text stated. “CurrencyWave removes the complexity and high cost of receiving, holding and sending payments in multiple currencies and serves a growing market of businesses involved in global trade”. Under the heading “CurrencyWave for Individuals” text stated, “wherever you live in the world, we can offer you a simple way of transferring money abroad, or repatriating funds back to your home country”. Throughout the homepage, CurrencyWave was repeatedly mentioned as facilitating the foreign exchange payments. We considered those claims implied that CurrencyWave was the entity responsible for conducting the payment transactions for consumers, whether individuals or businesses, and the references to “we” in relation to CurrencyWave further added to that impression. We also considered that the similarity of the company’s names, CurrencyWave and CurrencyCloud, would add to the likelihood of ambiguity regarding their relationship and whether or not they were linked. The rest of the webpage included information on CurrencyWave’s service, how it worked and the steps to register with CurrencyWave to open an account. We therefore considered that consumers would understand that CurrencyWave was the provider of the foreign exchange payment services and that their online accounts and transactions would be handled by CurrencyWave. We acknowledged that the ad included the wording “Powered by: Currencycloud A Visa Solution” near the top of the home page. However, we considered “powered by” was ambiguous and did not explain the nature of the relationship between CurrencyWave and CurrencyCloud. There were also references to CurrencyWave having an “FCA E-Money Partner”, which appeared under the heading “Use CurrencyWave With Confidence”. We did not consider that claim was sufficient to make clear that another company was responsible for handling the payments or that consumers would have understood that to mean that CurrencyCloud was the company that was conducting the payment services. We considered that was information that should have been included upfront.The ad included text in the footer that stated, “payment services for CurrencyWave are provided by The Currency Cloud Limited”. We considered that wording appeared in very small text and at the bottom of the page, and therefore it was likely to be overlooked. Notwithstanding that, even if some consumers had seen it, it was insufficient to override the impression that the foreign exchange payment services were carried out by CurrencyWave. Because the ad gave the impression that the foreign exchange payment services and financial transactions were provided by CurrencyWave when that was not the case, we concluded that the ad was misleading and breached the Code. On this point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 and 3.10 (Qualifications). 2.Upheld As referenced above, we considered that the overall impression of the ad was that CurrencyWave was responsible for conducting the payments. Under the heading “Use CurrencyWave with Confidence”, the webpage featured the claims “FCA Regulated E-Money Partner” and “Funds are Safeguarded by our FCA Regulated E-Money Partners at a credit institution”. The embedded video in the ad opened with on-screen text which stated, “CurrencyWave - Smarter Global Payments” and discussed the process and costs of making foreign exchange payments via a consumer’s bank, which were presented as costly and time consuming. The voice-over said, “But there is another way” and CurrencyWave was then presented as an easier and cheaper alternative method to do such transactions. It featured the claims “Your payments will be sent through a fully FCA Authorised platform” and on-screen text stated, “FCA Authorised”. The video did not mention CurrencyCloud and we considered in that context, the claims referencing FCA authorisation and regulation would be understood by consumers to refer to CurrencyWave as being FCA regulated. However, we understood that CurrencyCloud was FCA authorised, but CurrencyWave was not.At the bottom of the webpage text stated, “The Currency Cloud Limited is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority”. As referenced above, that wording appeared in very small text, positioned at the bottom of the page, and therefore we considered it was likely to be overlooked. Notwithstanding that, even if some consumers had seen it, it was insufficient to override the impression that CurrencyWave was FCA authorised. Because the ad implied that CurrencyWave was authorised by the FCA when that was not the case, we considered the claims and impression of the ad was likely to mislead. On this point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9, 3.10 (Qualifications) and 3.50 (Endorsement and testimonials). 3.Upheld The ad featured a chart comparing the cost of sending $75,000 with CurrencyWave and four other companies and included the amount that was saved if they used CurrencyWave over those other providers. Text stated that this information was obtained from exchange rates obtained on 25 October 2022. We noted CurrencyWave’s point that exchange rates were dynamic and subject to continuous change. We therefore considered that using exchange rate data taken more than 12 months prior to when the ad was seen could not give a reliable or accurate representation of the rates consumers could expect to receive from CurrencyWave or from the other companies. The information explaining the basis of the cost comparison was in small text underneath larger, more prominent text. Notwithstanding that, even if that information had been more prominently stated any pricing claims that were based on that data would be misleading. We also considered that for comparisons to be accurate, monitoring of competitor exchange rates would need to be updated much more frequently; we had not been provided with any evidence that this was being done. We therefore concluded that the cost comparison information was likely to mislead and breached the Code. On this point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3, (Misleading advertising) and 3.33 (Comparisons).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told CurrencyWave Ltd to ensure they did not imply that they conducted foreign exchange payments and financial transactions if that was not the case. We also told them not to claim or imply they were FCA authorised if they were not, and to ensure that any future price comparisons were accurate, including by using up to date exchange rates.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/currencywave-ltd-a24-1236439-currencywave-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Eurostar International Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid for Instagram post and a post on Eurostar’s Facebook page seen in June 2024: a. The paid for Instagram post stated, “Book now – London > Amsterdam from £39 each way* […] *T&Cs apply.” b. The post on the Eurostar Facebook page stated, “Book now – London > Brussels from £39 each way* […] *T&Cs apply.”","The complainant, who had only found limited tickets at the advertised price, challenged whether ads (a) and (b) were misleading because they: 1. exaggerated the availability of the advertised tickets; and 2. omitted a significant limitation.","1. Eurostar International Ltd (Eurostar) stated that providing ticket availability, at an advertised price, as a percentage of total tickets, for tickets looking forward from a specific date did not give an accurate representation of availability. That was because a certain number of their tickets would be sold business to consumer and a certain proportion business to business and that was dynamic and demand driven. In addition, they regularly injected tickets when availability at a particular price could be low. On that basis, they believed a forward-looking calculation was not simple and could be misleading. They stated that they could provide a calculation based on actual sales figures. They showed that as of 21 July 2024, 11.6% of tickets at £39 had been sold for travel on the two routes between the relevant travel dates, excluding blackout dates. They believed on that basis the “from” claim in the ads did not exaggerate the availability or amount of tickets available to consumers. 2. Eurostar said that the travel dates were clearly set out in their terms and conditions. They were presented on a page one click away from the ad. They believed that was a common way of displaying them and most consumers would expect the dates to be located there. They explained that there was only limited space in the ads to include all conditions.They said that when the ads were live, the travel periods for which the advertised price was available covered typical forward-looking periods and a significant majority of their customers usually purchased tickets in advance in line with the forward-looking travel dates. For that reason, forward-looking periods would not have been seen as a restriction for the majority of their customers and consumers would not have seen the offer as open ended.","1. Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claims “Book now – London > Brussels from £39 each way*” and “Book now – London > Amsterdam from £39 each way*” to mean that a significant proportion of fares to Brussels or Amsterdam would be available to purchase at £39 from June 2024, when the ads were seen, for the current bookable period. We also considered that consumers would expect to find the tickets available at the “from” price across a range of dates and times within that period, and that they would have a reasonable chance of obtaining a seat at the advertised price. We therefore expected to see evidence demonstrating that a significant proportion of the available tickets could be purchased at the “from” price of £39. We understood that the dates the offer applied to when the ads were seen were 26 June 2024 to 30 October 2024 for London to Brussels and 15 May 2024 to 18 September 2024 for London to Amsterdam. However, that was not made clear in the ad. Notwithstanding that, Eurostar had not been able to provide us with evidence demonstrating the proportion of tickets available at the “from” price at the time the ad was seen, either for the bookable period at the time, or for the period during which the promotion ran. The historical data provided by Eurostar only gave information about the number of tickets sold and did not provide figures on the availability of the £39 tickets or the number of full priced tickets. We did not consider that was sufficient evidence to demonstrate the availability of tickets at the promotional price at the time the ad was seen. Concerning the future facing data, we noted Eurostar’s explanation that due to how they sold their tickets, such as private sales and the ad hoc injection of tickets, they were unable to provide forward looking data about availability that accurately represented their fares. Nevertheless, the responsibility was on Eurostar to demonstrate that the ""from"" price did not exaggerate the availability or number of benefits likely to be obtained by the consumer. The only data they had provided showed that 4.2% of the total number of tickets for London to Brussels and 1.6% of the total for London to Amsterdam were priced at £39. Therefore, because Eurostar were not able to provide historic availability figures and future facing data did not show a significant proportion of fares to Brussels or Amsterdam would be available to purchase at £39, we concluded the ads exaggerated the availability or number of benefits likely to be obtained by the consumer. The ads therefore were misleading.On that point the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), and 3.17 and 3.22 (Prices). 2. Upheld Ad (a) stated “Book now – London > Amsterdam from £39 each way* […] *T&Cs apply” and ad (b) stated Book now – London > Brussels from £39 each way* […] *T&Cs apply”. Neither ad qualified the claims, by stating that the offer applied to specific dates. We considered that the time period for which the offer applied, and any excluded dates, were likely to be material information to consumers. The ads were seen in June 2024 and we understood that for ad (a), the London to Amsterdam route, the dates the tickets were available from were 15 May 2024 to 18 September 2024. For ad (b), the London to Brussels route, the dates the tickets were available from were 26 June 2024 to 30 October 2024. Eurostar told us that those dates were available for consumers to see on the landing page that the ad clicked through to. That information on the landing page was located near the bottom of the page. Consumers would have had to click on an arrow next to text that stated “*Terms and conditions” which would then have revealed the relevant dates. We noted that qualifying tickets should have been immediately available for consumers who saw the ads in June, and these tickets would continue to be accessible until 18 September for London to Amsterdam and 30 October for London to Brussels. We considered however that some consumers would have wanted to book tickets outside of those dates, for instance in October for London to Amsterdam and November for London to Brussels. There was no information in the ads regarding dates that the tickets were available for. While information was on the landing page, it was close to the bottom and consumers would have to click further to reveal the dates. Therefore, it had not been immediately visible, and consumers would have had to scroll a long way to the bottom of the page to locate it. Because the ads did not include any information about the offer dates, which was material information, and the landing page had not presented that information immediately to consumers, we concluded that the ads were misleading. On that point the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 3.9 (Qualification).","We told Eurostar International Ltd to ensure that when using “from” price claims in future, a significant proportion of the advertised fares were available at the advertised price. We also told them to ensure that future marketing made travel dates sufficiently clear for tickets with limited availability.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/eurostar-international-ltd-a24-1247879-eurostar-international-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Go Night Night (unconfirmed),,"A website for sleep consultancy company Go Night Night, www.go-night-night.com, seen on 14 June 2024. Every page of the website featured the Federation of Antenatal Educators’ logo, which contained the text “FEDANT, Federation of Antenatal Educators”.","The Federation of Antenatal Educators (FEDANT), who said that Go Night Night were not registered with them, challenged whether the use of their logo was misleading.",Go Night Night did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Go Night Night’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. We considered consumers would interpret the inclusion of FEDANT’s logo, which appeared on every page on the website, and contained the text “FEDANT, Federation of Antenatal Educators”, to mean that Go Night Night was registered with them. FEDANT administers the national register and professional standards of antenatal educators, breastfeeding counsellors and doulas in the UK.However, we understood that Go Night Night was not registered with them. We therefore concluded that the use of the FEDANT logo was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.50 and 3.51 (Endorsements and Testimonials).",The ad must not appear again in its current form.

ASA Ruling on The Boots Company plc,,"A TV and Video on Demand (VOD) ad for Boots’ No7 Future Renew serum, seen in April 2024: a. The TV ad began with a woman looking at a photograph from 10 years ago and she said, “Remember this? Can’t believe we didn’t always use sunscreen.” Small print stated, “Recommended with daily SPF usage”. Another version of the woman, with a second woman, came to life in a photograph and responded saying, “I know right, we were too busy having fun.” It then switched to a contemporary version of the first women in a photograph, saying, “Let’s not regret our sunny memories.” To which the second woman in a framed photo next to the first whispered, “Let’s do something about it.” The voice-over then said, “No 7 Future Renew serum.” The voice-over and on-screen text then said, “Clinically proven to reverse visible signs of sun damage. A world-first peptide technology.” Small print stated, “APPEARANCE OF FINE LINES & WRINKLES, UNEVEN SKIN TONE AND DULLNESS”. The final shot showed the range of No7 Future Renew products. The voice-over and on-screen text said, “Don’t regret just reverse.” b. The VOD ad contained the same content as ad (a).","Eighteen complainants, who believed ads (a) and (b) condoned not using sunscreen by stating skin damage could be dealt with retrospectively with the product, objected that the ads were irresponsible and harmful, particularly due to the risks associated with skin cancer.","The Boots Company plc t/a Boots said as a pharmacy-led retailer and a manufacturer of health and beauty products, including sun protection and skincare products, they took sun protection very seriously. Their promotion of sunscreen and sun protection included partnerships with MacMillan Cancer Support, the Irish Cancer Society and the American Cancer Society. They also had various initiatives in store to train their staff to provide assistance and advice to consumers about sun protection. Boots explained that the background to the ad was based on three pieces of consumer research. They showed many consumers regularly did not apply sunscreen or only did so when in the sun for extended periods or in full sunshine, and few understood that the main cause of the visible facial signs of ageing was the damaging effects of repeated exposure to the sun. Skin ageing was often seen by the women surveyed as an inevitability and even when they were made aware that 80% of visible skin damage was caused by the sun, they struggled to attribute it to the damage and not just the passing of time. Boots said further, that 70% of annual exposure to the sun occurred outside of the traditional two-week summer holiday, including in the autumn and winter months. Based on that knowledge the ad depicted a series of outdoor memory scenarios, such as a picnic in the shade, a festival or a walk in the woods where both the settings and clothing shown indicated temperatures that were not especially hot. They were events where using sunscreen would not have been at the forefront of a person’s mind ten years ago. Boots confirmed there was also intentionally no use of scenes such as the beach or pool, of prolonged lack of sun protection or of sun protection intentionally not being used. That was reinforced by the woman, in the first few seconds of the ad, saying, “I can’t believe we didn’t always use sunscreen” alongside superimposed text that stated “Recommended with daily SPF usage”. The ad therefore made clear that sunscreen was not worn consistently in the past and indicated that there was now a higher awareness of the need to wear it regularly. In addition, the superimposed text regarding “daily SPF usage” clarified that the advertised products should always be used with a daily SPF regime and that the use of No7 Future Renew serum, the featured product in the ad, did not mean that sun protection was not necessary.Boots said the ad also had additional on-screen text, “APPEARANCE OF FINE LINES & WRINKLES, UNEVEN SKIN TONE AND DULLNESS”, that qualified the spoken “Clinically proven to reverse visible signs of sun damage” claim. The ad therefore did not imply that all forms of damage caused by the sun could be addressed by using the No7 Future Renew serum and was prepared with a sense of responsibility to the audience and society. Clearcast said the women in the ad were older, looking back at their younger days, and it was clear they regretted their decision to not wear sunscreen consistently. They noted that one of the women said, “I can’t believe we didn’t always wear suncream”, which made clear that the women historically did wear sun protection but not as regularly as guidance advised. They further highlighted the superimposed text in the ad that stated, “Recommended with daily SPF use” which meant the ad advised sun protection. They also raised that while the main product in the ad was the No7 Future Renew serum, the last frame of the ad showed the range of products and that included a day cream with SPF 40. Clearcast explained the ad sold an anti-ageing cosmetic product and clearly defined who was being targeted. It was not aimed at young people and never suggested that it was a good idea not to wear sun protection. In contrast, the ad highlighted the specific cosmetic damage the sun does. The ad therefore, while promoting an anti-ageing product, was a positive example of why sun protection should be worn at all stages of life.Clearcast said that the ad only addressed the visible signs of sun damage and explained in the qualifying text what that meant. It would therefore have been clear to viewers, who they believed had a good knowledge of protecting their skin from the sun, that it was a cosmetic product and would not assist with serious conditions such as cancer, which went beyond the visible cosmetic signs highlighted in the ad. The ad therefore was not irresponsible or harmful.","The ASA acknowledged Boots’ argument that the examples of not using sunscreen were historic, and therefore not a reflection of the women’s current attitude, and that all scenes were of times when the sun was either low or obscured. However, the women in the ads made statements such as “too busy having fun” to have always used sunscreen and ”Let’s not regret our sunny memories” but “do something about it” using the product, which was stated to be “Clinically proven to reverse visible signs of sun damage”. On-screen text further said, “DON’T REGRET JUST REVERSE”. We considered that the tone of the conversation between the women was light-hearted and flippant about the subject of sun damage and would be seen to suggest that not using suncream could be taken lightly. We considered that message was further reinforced by claims that the visible signs of damage resulting from previous exposure to the sun could be reversed by using the product. Although small on-screen text said, “Recommended with daily SPF usage”, it appeared at the beginning of the ad only for a brief period of time. For those reasons, we concluded the ads condoned exposure to the sun without sunscreen and therefore were irresponsible and harmful. Ad (a) breached BCAP Code rules 1.2 (Compliance) and 4.4 (Harm and Offence), and ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Compliance) and 4.5 (Harm and Offence).",The ads must not appear in the form complained of. We told The Boots Company plc t/a Boots that ads should not condone or encourage the non-use of sunscreen.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/the-boots-company-plc-g24-1242237-the-boots-company-plc.html
ASA Ruling on Wickes Building Supplies Ltd t/a Wickes,,"An X post on Wickes’ own account, posted on 25 June 2024, stated, “We’ve teamed up with @jeffbrazier to find a garden lover who could win £5,000 worth of vouchers to transform their outdoor space! Take a picture of your outdoor entertaining space, and share with #WickesBestHost T&Cs apply”. The post also featured a video with photos of outdoor entertaining spaces and on-screen text that stated, “Show us what you’ve got! Enter now. Win £5,000 for your outdoor entertaining space. Tag us in your garden pictures. Share a photo for your chance to win £5,000 for your outdoor entertaining space. Show us what you’ve got!”.","The complainants challenged whether the competition was misleading, because they believed participants were not provided with sufficient information regarding the criteria and mechanism for judging entries.","Wickes Building Supplies Ltd t/a Wickes said the competition entrants were required to take a picture of their outdoor entertaining space and upload the picture with the hashtag #Wickesbesthost. That hashtag was included in the X post, which also had a video with more details on how to enter the competition and details of the prize. Similarly, that hashtag was included in the “How to participate” section of the terms and conditions. They said that hashtag suggested and incorporated the messaging that the “best” outdoor entertaining space would be the deciding factor for the winner. Wickes said one of the judges of the competition was a representative from Clarion, the public relations agency that created and administered the promotion. The representative did not otherwise work directly with Wickes and was responsible for shortlisting the entries. Jeff Brazier, who also was not employed by Wickes, was a guest judge and was responsible for selecting the winner. They said the judges were provided with guidelines to use when shortlisting and selecting a winner, which included key things to consider, such as that the outdoor entertaining space should illustrate a set up for hosting guests during the summer and that it should not be limited to outdoor furniture, but should also include the use of, for example, plants, lighting, paint or a gazebo. In addition, the judges were given a scoring matrix which was based on five key questions, for example, “How do you rate the visual aesthetics of the outdoor space?”. They explained that, as noted in the terms and conditions, shortlisted entrants were asked to provide, in 200 words or less, an explanation on the motivation behind the design of their outdoor space. They said that also demonstrated that the judging criteria was centred on the best outdoor hosting/entertaining spaces.","The CAP Code stated that prize promotions must specify on all marketing communications or other material referring to them, clearly before or at the time of entry, in a competition, the criteria and mechanism for judging entries, where its omission was likely to mislead. All marketing communications or other material referring to promotions must also communicate all applicable significant conditions or information where the omission of such conditions or information was likely to mislead. Significant conditions may include how to participate. The ASA understood that to enter the competition, entrants were required to take a picture of their outdoor entertaining space and upload the picture with the hashtag #WickesBestHost. Judging criteria included a scoring matrix based on five key questions the judges had to consider. We considered the judging criteria to be material information that consumers required to inform a potential entry to the competition. However, the ad did not provide information on how the two stages of the competition would be judged, apart from the hashtag #WickesBestHost. We considered, however, that “WickesBestHost” alone was not sufficient to explain to entrants what the judging criteria were. We acknowledged there was a video on the X post that stated, “Show us what you’ve got” and “Tag us in your garden pictures for your chance to win £5,000 for your outdoor entertaining space”. However, that video also did not provide any further information to entrants on what the criteria was for judging entries. We further noted that shortlisted entries had to provide a 200-word explanation on the motivation behind the design of their outdoor space. We considered the existence of that second stage of the competition was a significant condition relating to how to participate and therefore that requirement should have been made immediately clear to potential entrants in the ad, rather than only in the terms and conditions. Furthermore, we considered that the requirement to provide an explanation on the motivation behind the design of their outdoor space was also not sufficient to make the judging criteria clear to potential entrants or provide a definitive explanation as to how to get shortlisted. We considered the criteria for judging entries to the competition, and the significant conditions on how to participate, were not made sufficiently clear and the competition was therefore misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.17 and 8.17.1 (Significant conditions for promotions) and 8.28 and 8.28.6 (Prize promotions).","We told Wickes Building Supplies Ltd t/a Wickes to ensure they clearly set out the criteria for judging entries in future competitions, along with significant conditions on how to participate.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/wickes-building-supplies-ltd-g24-1254614-wickes-building-supplies-ltd.html

The complainant, who believed they had qualified for the offer in ad (a), but was unclear why they had initially been unable to access it, challenged the presentation of the promotion. 2. The complainant, who had been unable to access the offer in ad (b), challenged whether the promotion had caused unnecessary disappointment.","1. Just Eat.co.uk t/a Just Eat said it was never their intention to mislead consumers and on identification of the complaint, they had taken steps to resolve the matter. The promotion was originally run from 18 April to 1 May 2024, allowing the customer to claim a £12 voucher to be redeemed against their next order no later than 9 May 2024. As stated in the promotional terms, the offer was valid on a “first come first served for up to 33,000 orders” basis. At the end of the initial campaign period, their records showed that a significant number of the vouchers remained unclaimed.They confirmed the complainant did receive the voucher on 15 May, but it had been delayed. The reason for the delay was because the minimum order value of £20, as set out in the terms, was initially calculated based only on the value of food orders and did not include any service charges or delivery fees. Once that was spotted, they updated the calculation and subsequently contacted all impacted customers by email with a voucher. They said they would ensure future promotions clearly set out the components of the minimum order value. 2. Just Eat said the restaurant in question was not a named restaurant in the promotion communications. They said a technical issue resulted in the “Order Now” button within the 28 May 2024 Cheeky Tuesday promotion communications linking through to a landing page on Just Eat’s website that included a variety of offers, including, but not limited to, Cheeky Tuesday offers, instead of taking the customer to the usual “Cheeky Tuesday” promotion landing page (which included only restaurants opted-in to Cheeky Tuesday on the relevant date). That technical issue was fixed prior to the 4 June 2024 Cheeky Tuesday promotion communications. The complainant’s order journey within the Just Eat platform on 28 May 2024 would have communicated which offer(s) the restaurant was running and would apply to their order. That meant there would have been no reference to the Cheeky Tuesday offer throughout the order journey and in relation to the restaurant. While the complainant’s order on 28 May 2024 did not benefit from the Cheeky Tuesday offer, the complainant did receive a separate (free item) offer, worth £5. They acknowledged that the marketing email sent to the complainant included a link, which may have resulted in confusion as to how to navigate to restaurants that had opted-in to the Cheeky Tuesday offer once the complainant landed on their website.","The CAP Code stated that all marketing communications or other material referring to promotions must communicate all applicable significant conditions or information where the omission of such conditions or information was likely to mislead. Significant conditions or information may, depending on the circumstances, include how to participate, including significant conditions and costs, and other major factors reasonably likely to influence consumer's decision or understanding about the promotion. The ASA understood that the limit of 33,000 vouchers had not been reached and that the offer was still available at the time the complainant attempted to redeem it. Notwithstanding, we noted that the ad stated, “Redeem your £12 voucher on your next order in the Just Eat app by 9th May 2024. Minimum order value of £20 …”. We considered consumers were likely to understand therefore that to redeem the £12 voucher, they would have to spend a minimum of £20 in total. However, the complainant had not received the voucher because the minimum order value of £20 was based only on the cost of the food order, and any service charges or delivery fees were excluded. That condition, which we considered to be significant, was not made clear in the ad and we therefore concluded that the promotion breached the Code. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code Edition 12 rules 8.17 and 8.17.1 (Promotional Marketing). The CAP Code stated promoters must conduct their promotions equitably, promptly and efficiently and be seen to deal fairly and honourably with participants and potential participants. Promoters must avoid causing unnecessary disappointment.The ad stated, “Feeling cheeky yet? On Tuesdays you get 20%* off” and further text stated, “*Selected restaurants only”.We acknowledged that the restaurant in question was not part of the Cheeky Tuesday offer and understood it was not listed as being part of the Cheeky Tuesday offer on the Just Eat website. However, the ad included a link, via the “ORDER NOW” button, which directed the complainant to a landing page that we understood contained a number of offers, including the Cheeky Tuesday promotion. We considered consumers were therefore likely to understand that the Cheeky Tuesday offer featured would apply to the restaurants accessed from that page, including the one the complainant placed an order with. However, the promotion was not available with that restaurant. Because the ad contained a link that directed consumers to restaurants that were not part of the Cheeky Tuesday offer, we concluded that the promotion was likely to have caused participants unnecessary disappointment. We therefore concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code Edition 12 rule 8.2 (Promotional Marketing).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Just Eat.co.uk t/a Just Eat to ensure their future promotions included all significant conditions and to avoid causing unnecessary disappointment to participants.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/just-eat-co-uk-ltd-g24-1248327-just-eat-co-uk-ltd.html
"ASA Ruling on Webloyalty International Ltd t/a Webloyalty, Complete Savings","This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on online choice architecture, identified for investigation following complaints received and intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 25 September 2024. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld. Working with Moonpig.com Ltd 10 Back Hill, London, EC1R 5EN ","Two in-app ads and a pop-up banner ad for Webloyalty, a shopper reward programme, seen in December 2023 and January 2024: a. The first in-app ad, seen in the Domino’s Pizza mobile app at the end of the checkout process, featured text that stated, “Your order is complete. £20.87 cash back! Tap here to claim the above reward, credited onto your card, when you next place an order at Domino’s!” above a clickable button labelled “Continue”. Smaller text underneath that button stated, “By tapping above, you can join our partner programme for £18/month and claim your reward”. b. The second in-app ad, seen in the Moonpig mobile app at the end of the checkout process, featured text that stated, “Your order is complete. £20.87 cash back! Tap here to claim the above reward, credited onto your card, when you next place an order at Moonpig!” above a clickable button labelled “Continue”. Smaller text underneath that button stated, “By tapping above, you can join our partner programme for 18 pounds/month and claim your reward”. c. The banner ad, seen on the Asda website at the end of the checkout process, featured text that stated, “Your order is complete. £20.87 cash back! Tap here to claim the above reward, credited onto your card, when you next place an order at Asda!” above a clickable button labelled “Continue”. Smaller text underneath that button stated, “By tapping above, you can join our partner programme for £18/month and claim your reward”.",The complainant challenged whether: 1. ad (a) was misleading because the presentation of the options at conclusion of payment was unclear. The ASA challenged whether: 2. ads (b) and (c) were misleading because the presentation of options at conclusion of payment was unclear.,"1. & 2. Webloyalty International Ltd t/a Webloyalty said that the first reward a consumer would receive under the cashback programme, which was referenced in the ads, was a welcome reward for those who joined the Complete Savings programme. They explained that the welcome reward was a fixed amount, although the amount could vary by partner, but confirmed all consumers would be offered the same reward on any given partner website. They believed that the average consumer would interpret the word “reward” as being a welcome reward for joining the programme because the text under the “Continue” button stated, “By tapping above, you can join our partner programme for 18 pounds/month and claim your reward”. They also explained that when the “Continue” button was clicked, the following webpage made clear that the reward was contingent upon joining the Complete Savings website. They highlighted that their ads only appeared at the end of a consumer’s online journey with a retailer and said that consumers were reminded several times of the fact that their transaction with the partner website was complete and that no further action was required. They referred to examples on the webpages preceding the ads, the order confirmation webpages in which the ads were seen and the ads themselves. They said that, prior to seeing the ads on the checkout page, text on the preceding order confirmation pages for each of the retailers would have signalled to consumers that their order would shortly be completed. They asserted that it would be unusual for consumers to have to complete an additional stage after payment had been taken. Because of that, they believed consumers would not believe it was necessary to click the “Continue” button seen in the ads to finalise their purchase.In relation to the webpages in which the ads were seen, Webloyalty believed that it was clear a consumer’s order was complete. In ad (a), they referred to the text “We’ve got it”, along with the inclusion of an estimated delivery time, and a button which linked to a “Pizza Tracker”, which they said made clear to the consumer that their transaction with Domino’s Pizza was complete. They also said that ad (b) included the text “Order Confirmation” and that ad (c) stated, “Thanks for your Order” with an estimated order arrival date, which again they believed made clear that no further steps were required of the consumer to complete their order. With reference to the ads themselves, they believed that the text “Your order is complete” made it clear to consumers that they did not need to click on the “Continue” button. Furthermore, they said that text was emphasised in its formatting whenever possible. In addition, they re-iterated that the text below the “Continue” button disclosed the nature of the offer, and that a consumer would be joining a paid-for partner programme. Discussing the “Continue” button further, Webloyalty explained that its purpose in the ads was to direct interested consumers to their enrolment page, in order to find out more about the cashback programme and decide whether or not to join. They stated that the webpage included information which detailed the price, billing terms, benefits of the programme and the subscription method. They highlighted that consumers were not able to enrol into the cashback programme immediately after clicking on the “Continue” button and would always be taken to the enrolment webpage. Furthermore, Webloyalty believed that the ads were limited in space beyond their control, and because of that, they had ensured that all material information had been included in the enrolment webpage. They also believed it was clear that the ads, and the cashback service itself, were offered by a third-party service. They said that consumers expected ads to be displayed at the end of the consumer journey, and therefore, they would understand that these ads were marketing communications. Furthermore, they said, in most cases, the ads appeared as a pop-up, which also conveyed the commercial nature of the ad to consumers. They re-iterated that it was also made clear from the content of the ads themselves, because they stated that a consumer must “join a partner programme”, “join our partner programme for £18”, as well as the enrolment webpage, which included details such as the Webloyalty logo and text that stated they were a “preferred partner of [relevant merchant]”. They said that consumers expected ads to be displayed at the end of the consumer journey, and therefore, they would understand that the ads were marketing communications. Furthermore, they said, in most cases, the ads appeared as a pop-up, which also conveyed the commercial nature of the ad to consumers.However, they said that they were willing to amend the ads. In future, they would be including the words “third-party” before “partner programme” in the ad and would no longer use the “Continue” button. They also highlighted that they had previously contacted the CAP Copy Advice team in relation to previous iterations of the ads. Domino’s Pizza UK and Ireland Ltd t/a Domino’s Pizza did not believe that the average consumer would be misled by ad (a) because it was clear that their order had been completed. They believed that their webpage, the page the ad was seen on, clearly demonstrated that through the text “WE GOT THIS” and “You’ve ordered for Delivery! It should be with you between […] Get excited for your order”. They asserted that was sufficient to demonstrate to the average consumer that their order was complete and had been paid for. They re-iterated that the average consumer would not reasonably read that text and understand that a further step was necessary to complete their order. They further argued that this point was demonstrated by the “Pizza Tracker” at the bottom of the ad, which enabled consumers to track their order. They also commented on the content and presentation of the ad itself. They highlighted text in the ad clearly stated, “Your order is complete” and they believed a consumer would interpret the term “reward” as a reference to the stated cashback amount of £20.87. They believed that the headline text and the explanatory qualification which outlined the monthly cost of joining the partner programme were provided in immediate proximity to the “Continue” button and stated that they were in the same font size as the text in the button. In addition, they believed the text “Tap here to claim” and “By tapping above” made the purpose of the “Continue” button clear. Furthermore, because the ad offered a cash back service, they believed that it would be unusual for such an offer to be made prior to an order being placed and purchased, and therefore, consumers would understand that their purchase was complete.They also stated that the wording relating to the “partner programme” in the ad made clear that the offer was being provided by a partner of Domino’s rather than Domino’s directly and that there was third-party involvement. They highlighted that text was in the same font size as the other wording relating to the cashback offer, and as such, they considered that would not be missed by the average consumer. They said that impression was reinforced by the landing page that consumers were taken to when clicking the “Continue” button and that the “Complete Savings” logo, a Webloyalty brand, was included in a prominent position on that webpage. Asda Stores Ltd t/a Asda said that it was clear that the ad was for the Webloyalty cashback scheme. They emphasised that the ad was a separate pop-up banner and contained a logo for the scheme clearly and prominently, and as such, they believed it was clearly identifiable that it was an ad for a third party. In addition, they said that the ad had a very different appearance to Asda’s website branding. They highlighted that all of the buttons that the consumers would have clicked as part of the checkout process were green and white or blue and white and that the button which featured in the ad was black and white. Immediately under the logo, the ad stated, “Your order is complete”, which Asda said made clear to the consumer that their transaction was complete. They also said that there could be no ambiguity as to the commercial nature of the ad because of the text “you can join our partner programme for £18/month”. Furthermore, they explained that they had a loyalty programme called “Asda Rewards” and that would be widely known by consumers. On that basis, they did not believe it was reasonable to assume that a customer would understand that the “Complete Savings” cashback scheme promoted by the ad was an Asda loyalty scheme. They asserted that the presentation of the options was clear within the ad because consumers were presented with a binary choice: to click on the “Continue” button and join the cashback scheme; or to click the ‘X’ button and close the ad. They also highlighted that the order confirmation page was clearly positioned behind the ad, which they believed further emphasised the separation from a customer’s Asda order.Moonpig.com Ltd t/a Moonpig said that Webloyalty created the content used for the ad and they said they had relied on Webloyalty to ensure compliance with the CAP Code as stipulated in their contract. However, they believed it would be clear to the average consumer from the ad that the transaction with Moonpig had finished and that the advertised cashback scheme was from a third party. They noted that there was explicit reference to the consumer “next placing an order at Moonpig” and that the loyalty programme was a “partner programme”. They further detailed that they did not have a partner programme and that Moonpig were known for being a greeting card retailer rather than providing a loyalty programme. In addition, they highlighted that the “Continue” button only appeared after payment had been taken and consumers were informed that their order was complete. They believed that the text “Your Order is Complete” was clear and that was sufficient for the average consumer to conclude that the transaction had been finalised. They further stated that the branding, design and layout of the sign-up page accessed by clicking the “Continue” button were different to that of Moonpig, and therefore that it was obvious it was operated by a third party. For example, they said that the colours used in the ad were not Moonpig colours and their name did not feature on the sign-up page. They also highlighted that the ad did not include the Moonpig logo. They said details of the Webloyalty cashback scheme were provided if a consumer chose to click the “Continue” button, which further emphasised that the promotion was not run by Moonpig. However, they acknowledged that amending the ad to include a description of the programme as being from a “third party” would be beneficial to consumers.","The ASA considered that its starting point was to assess how the notional average consumer, who was reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect, would be likely to view the ad. We first assessed ad (a). We noted that it appeared centrally aligned within the app, and featured a large black button labelled “Continue” against a white background. Because of its central position, and the black background of the button which contrasted with the rest of the page, we considered that the button was visually prominent and, therefore, it was likely to be the first aspect of the page that consumers would notice.We also considered the ad within the context it was seen; specifically, the steps completed before reaching that page and the progression of the consumer journey. We noted that the ad was seen within the Domino’s app after an order had been selected and payment had been taken. We considered that, because consumers would look for visual clues to determine how they proceeded on a webpage, and given the visual prominence of the button, that consumers would have likely assumed that they needed to click the “Continue” button to conclude their browsing activity. We further considered that the phrasing of “Continue” gave the impression that it was necessary to click that button in order to conclude their activity on the webpage. Furthermore, we noted that there was nothing in the content of the ad placed upfront to indicate to consumers it was a marketing communication for a third party, and we considered that reinforced the impression that consumers would click “Continue” on the basis that it would finalise their activity in relation to the purchase they had just made. Whilst we considered that at least a significant minority of consumers would understand that the “Continue” button would allow them to exit that webpage, we noted that there was accompanying text above the button, which we considered a proportion of consumers would engage with. Consumers were offered “£20.87” which was described as a “reward”, and that they would be able to “claim […] when you next place an order at Domino’s”. For those who did read that text, we considered they would understand that they had earnt the cashback in relation to their recently finalised transaction and clicking the button would enable them to claim it, free of charge, on their next order. We considered that rewards were normally offered in exchange for, or as recompense for, doing a particular action. Therefore, we considered that the term “reward” suggested that the cashback was offered as a complimentary benefit to consumers in exchange for placing their order via the retailer. We also considered that impression was furthered by the word “claim”, which suggested that the consumer had already fulfilled their obligation to receive the reward, and that receiving it was not dependent on paying for a subscription. In addition, we considered that the amount of money offered as part of the reward, “£20.87”, was not a round number, and that consumers would likely assume it was calculated based on the total of their purchase, further reinforcing that they had earnt a specific amount of cashback on the order they had just placed. In addition, and as referenced above, we considered it was not clear that the ad was a marketing communication for a third party. We considered the text “when you next place an order at Domino’s” reinforced the impression that the ad originated from the retailer and suggested that the cashback would be paid by Domino’s. We next assessed ads (b) and (c). Similarly to ad (a), ad (b) contained a centrally aligned large black button labelled “Continue” against a white background. Whilst we acknowledged that in ad (b) certain elements of text were displayed in a pink font, we considered that the button remained visually prominent and would likely be one of the first aspects of the ad that consumers noticed. Ad (b) also appeared in the same context as ad (a); i.e., within the Moonpig app after an order had been selected and payment had been taken. However, we noted that ad (b) appeared as a pop-up and the background of the app had been darkened to focus attention on the pop-up. Because of that, and the stage at which it appeared during the consumer journey, we considered that consumers were likely to infer the pop-up required a choice related to their order and would have likely assumed that it was necessary to click the “Continue” button in order to end their browsing activity. Furthermore, there was nothing in the content of the ad placed upfront to signify that the ad was for a third-party savings programme, which we considered would further indicate to consumers that it was necessary to click the “Continue” button.Ad (c) was seen on the Asda website at the end of the checkout process and appeared as a banner ad at the bottom of the webpage. Whilst we considered it was less prominent than the placements of ads (a) and (b), we considered consumers, looking for visual clues as to how to proceed, would still likely notice the large “Continue” button, given the prominence of the black button against a white background. We also noted that ad (c) contained a “Complete Savings” logo, along with the standard text “you can join our partner programme from £18/month”, which both Webloyalty and Asda believed made clear that the ad was for the Webloyalty shopper reward programme. We did not consider that the average consumer would necessarily be aware of the loyalty programme or familiar with the “Complete Savings” logo and its significance. Furthermore, we considered the text “partner programme” was ambiguous as to its meaning and could be interpreted by consumers to mean a loyalty programme directly run by the retailer, which we understood was commonplace. We therefore considered that the inclusion of that logo and the text within the ad did not make clear that it was an ad for a third party. The same text above the “Continue” button was seen in both ads (b) and (c) as for ad (a) and we considered that, for those consumers who did engage with the text, their impression would be similar to that of ad (a). Whilst we, again, considered that this text was likely to be missed, for consumers who had seen it, we considered that they would understand that clicking the “Continue” button would allow them to receive cashback, for free, directly from the retailer in question. However, we understood that the “Continue” button in all ads led to a landing page on the Webloyalty website, whereby consumers could subscribe to pay a monthly fee in order to receive cashback across a number of different retailers. We further understood that the advertised cashback reward was an introductory incentive offered by Webloyalty, rather than the retailer, only to consumers who paid to join the scheme and that consumers were not eligible for the reward based on their recent transaction. Because we considered that consumers would either understand that the “Continue” button was a necessary step to finalise their transaction on the retailer website, or that they had earnt a specific amount of cashback on the order they had just placed which they could claim for free when they next ordered from the retailer, when that was not the case, we considered that the presentation of the options in the ads was likely to mislead. We acknowledged the advertisers’ argument that it was clear to consumers that by clicking the button they would be joining a paid-for subscription, because below the “Continue” button, text stated “By clicking above, you can join our partner programme for £18/month and claim your reward”. However, we considered that phrasing, specifically “can join our partner programme […] and claim your reward”, implied that consumers could receive the reward independently of joining the programme and did not make clear that subscribing to the partner programme was a prerequisite for claiming the reward. In any case, we noted the placement of that text was underneath the “Continue” button, and we considered that, for those consumers who inferred that the “Continue” button was the next necessary step in the consumer journey, that text would not be immediately obvious. We considered that they would have likely already clicked the “Continue” button before engaging with the text below the button. Furthermore, we noted that in ads (a) and (b) that text was less prominent than the text located above the button which described the £20.87 cashback reward. In ad (a) the relevant text which explained the monthly fee for the partner programme was in standard type face, in comparison to the text describing the cashback reward which was bolded, and in ad (b) the relevant text was significantly smaller than the text describing the cashback reward. In any case, we considered that the text “join our partner programme” would likely be interpreted by consumers, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, to mean the retailer’s own loyalty programme and that text was not sufficient to indicate that they were ads for a third-party loyalty scheme. We also noted the advertisers’ belief that it would be obvious to consumers that their transaction was complete from the context in which the ad was seen, and they would, therefore, understand that they were not required to click the “Continue” button. We noted the elements which may indicate to consumers that their order had already been finalised by the time the ad appeared, such as information regarding their order confirmation number, order trackers and delivery information. Ad (a) included an order confirmation number, an estimated time of arrival for the order and an order tracker at the bottom of the page and ad (c) included similar information, apart from the tracking functionality. However, we noted that ad (b) appeared as a pop-up upon the order being confirmed, and whilst text within the pop-up stated “Your order is complete”, we considered that a consumer was less likely to realise that their purchase was finalised before they were presented with the “Continue” button. Next, we considered the way in which consumers would engage with those elements, given the stage of the consumer journey and the prominence of the button within all three webpages. We considered that, throughout the consumer journey of their purchase, consumers would have been prompted to look for buttons or other visual stimuli which allowed them to progress on the relevant retailer webpage or app. We therefore considered that consumers would view the “Continue” button within that context, and having been primed to click on such visual cues previously in the consumer journey, the choice architecture and inclusion of the prominently displayed “Continue” button would prompt consumers to click that button on the assumption that it was necessary to conclude their activity with the retailer. Consumers were, in our view, likely to click the “Continue” button either because they believed it would end their consumer journey or because it appeared they would receive a free cashback reward based on their order from the retailer. Given that clicking on the button would in fact result in consumers being taken to a sign-up page for a third-party loyalty shopper scheme with a monthly fee, we concluded that the presentation of the options was likely to mislead. We welcomed the advertisers' assurance that they would amend their advertising. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications) 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).","The ad must not appear in its current form. We told Webloyalty International Ltd t/a Webloyalty, Domino’s Pizza UK and Ireland Ltd t/a Domino’s Pizza, Asda Stores Ltd t/a Asda and Moonpig.com Ltd t/a Moonpig to ensure that their ads were clearly identifiable as ads for a third-party subscription scheme and that the presentation of choices was clear.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/webloyalty-international-ltd-g24-1229880-webloyalty-international-sarl-ltd.html
"ASA Ruling on Webloyalty International Ltd t/a Webloyalty, Complete Savings","This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on online choice architecture, identified for investigation following complaints received and intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 25 September 2024. Working with: Papa John’s (GB) Ltd 11 Northfield Drive, Milton Keynes, MK15 0DQ","Three webpages on the Complete Savings website, www.completesavings.co.uk, a shopper reward programme, seen in February 2024: a. The first webpage, seen after purchasing an item from Argos, offered a “Welcome Reward”. Text stated, “YOUR WELCOME REWARD £20.87 CASH BACK CREDITED ONTO YOUR CARD”. Smaller text underneath stated, “To claim following this order at Argos Terms and Conditions Apply”. A sub-title stated, “Get your Welcome Reward” and below that text explained “credited onto your card, by signing up for all the cashback rewards of Complete Savings […] FREE for the first 30 days and only £18 per month thereafter”. The ad contained an online form for consumers to input personal and payment details. A green button was positioned below the form, with the text “YES! Click here now”. Small text underneath the button stated, “I want to sign up for my Complete Savings membership and get my £20.87 cash back credited onto my card!”. On the right was a rolling graphic which detailed three steps “1. Complete the three easy steps”, “2. Claim your £20.87 on the Complete Savings website within the next 90 days” and “3. We will credit £20.87 onto your card”. Underneath was a grey box which contained text in bold type outlining “the benefits of Complete Savings”, and stated, “£20.87 Welcome Reward. Just send Complete Savings your receipt within the next 90 days and we’ll send you the Cash"", “£18 Monthly Bonus”, “10% Cashback”. Further information about “Offer and Billing Details” was positioned in a grey box underneath, with links to Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy. b. The second webpage, seen after making a booking through Trainline, had a similar format to ad (a) and contained an online form for consumers to sign up to the programme. Text stated, “£20.87 cash back credited onto your card”. Smaller text underneath stated, “To claim after your next booking with Trainline Terms and Conditions Apply”. A sub-title stated, “Get your £20.87 cash back credited onto your card” and below that text explained, “By signing up for all the cashback rewards of Complete Savings […] FREE for the first 30 days and only £18 per month thereafter”. On the right was a rolling graphic with three steps, including, “1. Complete the three easy steps”, “2. Make a new booking with Trainline within 90 days and claim your £20.87 on the Complete Savings website” and “3. We will credit £20.87 onto your card”. Underneath was a grey box which contained bolded text outlining “the benefits of Complete Savings” and stated, “£20.87 Welcome Reward. To get your £20.87 cash back, credited onto your card, just make a booking with Trainline within the next 90 days”, “£18 Monthly Bonus”, “10% Cashback”. c. The third webpage, seen after placing an order with Papa John’s, was similarly formatted to ads (a) and (b). Like ad (a), it offered a “Welcome Reward”, with text stating “YOUR WELCOME REWARD £20.87 CASH BACK CREDITED ONTO YOUR CARD”. The ad contained the same text as ad (b), besides the sub-title, which stated, “Get your Welcome Reward”. The ad referenced Papa John’s where applicable.",,"Webloyalty International Ltd t/a Complete Savings believed the ads contained clear and upfront information that receiving the Welcome Reward was contingent upon joining a membership programme, and in the case of ads (b) and (c), making a second purchase. They said reinforcement and placement of information were essential to provide clarity for consumers of the overall offer and the membership programme. They highlighted that text at the top-left of each ad stated that the Welcome Reward could be claimed following the customer’s order, in ad (a), or following a subsequent purchase with the relevant retailer, in ads (b) and (c). They also highlighted the dynamic “How to” visual which moved through the three slides with the steps to obtain the Welcome Reward, including claiming the Welcome Reward within 90 days, and in ads (b) and (c), making a second purchase with the relevant retailer. They said in each of the ads, the requirements to claim the Welcome Reward were reiterated twice in a textbox underneath the “How to” visual. Whilst that text was located towards the bottom of the page, Complete Savings said that the “YES!” button used within the ads to sign up to the scheme, dropped down the page as a consumer entered in their details. Because of that, consumers would have to scroll down the page to click the button, at which point they would see those two references to the membership fee next to the “YES!” button in its new position. Complete Savings said each of the ads were preceded by banner ads on the websites of the partnering retailers. They explained that those ads contained information that the reward was dependent on joining a paid programme and, in the case of the banner ads that preceded ads (b) and (c), that it was dependent on making a second purchase with the partnered retailer. They therefore believed that consumers would be aware of those conditions prior to interacting with ads (a)(c).Complete Savings believed that the repeated use of the word “claim”, in describing the process to obtain the cashback reward, conveyed that additional steps were required before the consumer could obtain the Welcome Reward. Similarly, they said that the description of the cashback sum as a “reward” (which they believed, in itself, implied a relationship between an action and an outcome), in conjunction with “join” or “welcome” and disclosures on how it could be claimed, was sufficient to communicate that the cashback was offered in return for: enrolment in the programme; making a second purchase (if applicable); and making a claim. They also said that text in bold stated, “Complete the 3 easy steps below and click Yes to start your Complete Savings membership”, and therefore consumers would understand that they would be subscribing to their membership scheme by completing their details within the webform. Furthermore, Complete Savings highlighted that it was necessary for consumers to create a password. They believed that passwords were commonly created to register an account and, on that basis, consumers would understand that they were signing up to a membership scheme because it would not be practical to create a password for a one-off cashback offer. They believed consumers would question why they needed to create and confirm a password before providing payment card details. Complete Savings confirmed that the Welcome Reward could be redeemed by consumers even if they cancelled during the free trial period as stated in the box headed “Offer and Billing Details” in each of the ads. They also clarified that the current wait time was 7?10 days once the consumer had submitted a claim with valid receipts. Argos Ltd confirmed that they had an affiliate agreement with Webloyalty International Ltd, in which they received a commission fee for every consumer signed up to the Complete Savings programme through their website. They explained that, once a consumer had completed an order on their own website, a banner ad then appeared. If the consumer clicked on that banner ad, they were then directed to ad (a). Argos believed that in both steps of the customer journey, the investigated ads as well as the banner ads seen prior, it was sufficiently clear that consumers must join a paid membership programme and actively claim the cashback. Argos pointed out that the top-left of the ad stated that the Welcome Reward was for signing up to the programme, which was “FREE for the first 30 days and £18 per month thereafter”. They also highlighted that the steps for obtaining the reward were contained within the box headed, “Enjoy all the benefits of Complete Savings”. Argos also emphasised that the cashback was never described as “free” or a “gift”; they believed the description of the cashback as a “reward” would indicate that it was dependent on actions carried out by the consumer. They believed that impression was reinforced by the material information in the ad and by associating the term with active language such as “join” and “claim”.Trainline.com Ltd t/a Trainline also confirmed that they had an affiliate agreement with Webloyalty and that the ad appeared as both an in-page ad and a pop-up. They emphasised that while they were able to consult with Webloyalty to a certain degree on the presentation of the banner ad, Webloyalty had full control over the presentation of the ads under investigation.They also believed it was sufficiently clear in both their ad, and the preceding webpage, that consumers had to join a paid membership programme, make a second purchase and then claim the Welcome Reward. Trainline emphasised the ‘How To’ visual within the ad, which showed the required steps for consumers to obtain the cashback reward. They also said that, before signing up to the membership, consumers would be exposed five times to messaging that a second purchase was required with Trainline in order to claim cashback. They specifically referenced text in the preceding webpage which stated, “Click here to claim your £20.87 cash back, credited onto your card, when you next book with Trainline” made clear that a second purchase was necessary in order to receive the cashback. Trainline reiterated the comments made by Argos that the cashback was never described as free and that the use of the word “reward” implied that consumers needed to fulfil an obligation in order to receive the cashback.Papa John’s (GB) Ltd t/a Papa John’s also had a similar affiliate arrangement with Webloyalty. Papa John’s stated the ad appeared as either an in-page ad or a pop-up. Similarly, they emphasised that Webloyalty had full control over the presentation of the ads under investigation, that the use of the word “reward” and “claim” was sufficient to convey to consumers that they would have to fulfil further steps in order to receive the Welcome Reward, and that it was not implied that the cashback would be free.Papa John’s also said that the ad contained an equally prominent statement, “No thanks, please take me back to Papa John’s” to ensure that consumers would not be misled into a transaction they would not have otherwise taken.However, they said that, as a result of the complaint, they had instructed Webloyalty to make changes to the presentation of the ad in order to give consumers greater clarity on the steps required to receive the cashback reward.","The CAP Code required that marketing communications make clear the extent of the commitment the consumer must make to take advantage of a ""free"" offer. That Rule applied to claims which were likely to mean the same as “free” in the context of an ad.The ASA understood that Complete Savings partnered with various online retailers to offer a paid monthly cashback subscription, with the first 30 days free. We considered the consumer journey, which preceded the ads, in order to understand its impact on the average consumer’s understanding of the investigated ads. In each case, the consumer arrived at ads (a)(c) from a banner ad that appeared in the checkout page of the relevant retailer’s website which confirmed the consumer’s order. Each preceding webpage contained a variation on the text “By clicking above, you can join our third-party partner programme for 18 pounds/month and claim your reward”. We considered that phrasing implied that joining the partner programme was independent of claiming the advertised Welcome Reward. Furthermore, the webpages that preceded the ads emphasised that the order had been finalised (“YOUR TRANSACTION IS NOW COMPLETE”; “Your booking is complete”; “Your order is complete”), and therefore, we considered the subsequent offer of cashback appeared to be a reward for making the recent purchase. We also noted that, in the proceeding page before ads (b) and (c), the button which took consumers to the ads was labelled “Get your £20.87”. We considered that this further implied that, by completing the webform within the ad, consumers would be able to receive the advertised Welcome Reward without further obligation. As such, we considered that consumers would view the ads within that context and that, by clicking the respective buttons which led to the ads, they would be able to claim the advertised cashback without signing up to, or having to pay for, the “partner programme” and would not be subject to any other requirements. We acknowledged that, in the case of ads (b) and (c), text above the button stated that the cashback would be credited when “you next make a booking”. However, we considered that text would be easily overlooked in view of the prominent button labelled “Get your £20.87”, and we considered the average consumer’s overriding impression would be that, by clicking the button, they would be entitled to the welcome reward without further obligation. We then assessed the ads. Ads (a) and (c) contained a bright graphic of a bank card in the top-right corner which contained the claim, “YOUR WELCOME REWARD £20.87 CASH BACK CREDITED ONTO YOUR CARD”. In the top left, a headline claim stated, “Get your Welcome Reward”. A webform below prompted consumers to enter their details, and, alongside it, three numbered “steps” were presented (“1. Enter your name, address and email”; “2. Provide us with a credit or debit card”; “3. Create a password and click YES!”). The numbers of the steps were in the same font, colour and size as the headline claim, “Get your Welcome Reward”. We therefore considered consumers would infer that the webform was related to the headline claim which referred to the Welcome Reward and that, if they inputted their details, they would be credited with the cashback. We considered that impression was reinforced by the details required of consumers via the webform. We noted that they were prompted to enter their card details, and considered consumers would likely understand that it was necessary to fill out those details so that they could be credited with the cashback. Furthermore, text underneath the sign-up buttons labelled “YES!” in the ads stated, “I want to sign up for my Complete Savings membership and get my £20.87 cash back credited back onto my card”. We considered that text further implied that by inputting one’s personal information within the webform and clicking the button would mean that consumers would immediately receive the cashback reward for free, without any further action necessary from them. We acknowledged that text underneath the button also stated, “I want to sign up for my Complete Savings membership”, but we noted that it appeared within the context of further text which stated, “…and get my £20.87 cash back credited back onto my card”. Because the text also directly linked the “YES” button with receiving the cashback, we considered that consumers would therefore assume that, by clicking the button, they would automatically receive the cashback reward, regardless of the reference to signing up for a membership scheme. In any case, we noted that the text did not make clear the requirements of receiving the cashback reward or the cost of the membership scheme. We also acknowledged Complete Saving’s argument that consumers would understand they were signing up for a subscription or membership because they had to create a password as part of the webform, and that would not usually be necessary for a one-off payment. However, we considered that it was commonplace for consumers to set up an account with a password, and that practice was not limited to paid-for monthly memberships; for example, consumers are usually required to have an account, and create a password, in order to access free loyalty schemes operated by retailers. Ad (b) followed the same format as ads (a) and (c). It featured a similar graphic of a credit card, a headline claim, a webform accompanied by the same numbered instructional steps, and the same “YES!” button and associated text. However, the claims within the ad differed somewhat; in ad (b) the claim within the bank card stated, “£20.87 cash back credited onto your card”, and the headline claim on the left stated, “Get your £20.87 cash back credited onto your card”. We considered those features similarly implied that, on the condition that consumers completed the webform, they would receive £20.87 cashback credited onto their card. Furthermore, we considered the reference to “your” cashback in the headline claim (“Get your £20.87 cash back credited onto your card”) reinforced the impression that the consumer had already fulfilled the necessary requirements in order to receive the cashback offer. However, we understood that to obtain the Welcome Reward advertised in ad (a), consumers were required to subscribe to the paid-for Complete Savings membership and actively claim the reward through the website within 90 days. Consumers similarly had to follow that process in order to claim the Welcome Reward in ad (b) and (c), but in addition, they had to make a second purchase with the relevant retailer within 90 days of the initial purchase. We acknowledged the ads stated that the membership cost was £18 after the first free month and that information appeared on four occasions within the ads, including underneath the headline and in one of the numbered “step” boxes. We also noted that further information within the numbered “step” boxes referred to terms such as “billing” and “membership fee”. In each instance, however, that information was presented in small font and was positioned within a larger paragraph, which we considered was significantly less prominent than the headline or subtitled claims that emphasised the Welcome Reward and cashback offer. We therefore considered consumers were less likely to notice that they would be charged after the trial month. We also noted that two of the four instances were placed under the subtitle “Offer and Billing Details”, located below the sign-up button in the bottom third of the page, and it was necessary to scroll down within the ad for that section to appear. We acknowledged that Complete Savings said the button would drop down when consumer information was inputted into the webform. However, we were not able to repeat that. In any case, we considered, at that stage, consumers had been primed to click the “YES!” button after completing the form, and would likely overlook that information, which was presented in small text, regardless of whether the button scrolled or not. In addition, we noted that there was another reference to the amount of £18 within the ad; the monthly bonus offered to those who signed up to the cashback scheme was also £18, and that was referenced in a larger and more prominent font within the ad. We considered that this further obfuscated the references to £18 and made the monthly payment commitment unclear to consumers. We therefore considered the ad did not make the extent of the commitment required adequately clear or upfront to consumers.We acknowledged the advertisers’ comments that the description of the cashback as a “reward” or “Welcome Reward” would imply to consumers that it was contingent on them fulfilling an obligation. However, we considered consumers would interpret that obligation as being the purchase they had just made, and that therefore, they were already eligible for the Welcome Reward. We considered it was not made clear to consumers that the action for which they would be rewarded was joining a paid-for membership scheme and personally claiming the reward through the Complete Savings website, and, in the case of ads (b) and (c), by making a second purchase with that retailer. We further acknowledged that text in bold type at the top of the page, placed directly above the webform, stated, “Complete the 3 easy steps below and click Yes to start your Complete Savings membership”. Whilst that text referenced the Complete Savings membership and appeared in a bold font, we noted that the size of font remained small in comparison to other text on the page. We also considered that the ads contained a significant amount of information and that it was presented in a number of different ways: a rotating dynamic graphic made up of three slides; three information boxes pointing to the webform; a large credit card icon highlighting the Welcome Reward; and a further box made up of three sub-headings and icon imagery. We considered that such presentation within the ad made the necessary requirements difficult to navigate, access and understand. We further considered the advertisers’ argument that the repeated use of “claim” in relation to the reward was sufficient to imply that consumers were required to actively obtain the reward, rather than being automatically credited. However, we noted that the term “claim” was used only twice in each of the ads, and instead the ads emphasised wording which implied no further action was necessary from consumers, such as “credited onto your card”. Notwithstanding that, we considered the word “claim” was not sufficient to convey that the reward would have to be actively requested by the consumer rather than being automatically applied. In particular, because the wording and the placement of the webform, in the absence of upfront information explaining that the reward must be actively claimed, would imply that the consumer should input their details so that they could receive the cashback as advertised, with no further steps required. With that in mind, we considered that consumers would interpret the action necessary to “claim” the reward was completing the webform, and consequently, that it would be applied to their account upon completion and submission of the webform. In addition, the button which led consumers to ads (b) and (c) was labelled “Get Your £20.87” which we considered would further that impression to consumers. Because the information about the extent of the commitment required to obtain the free cashback was stated only in small font within paragraph text, or in a dynamic slide, which was not permanently appearing, we considered that it was not clear to consumers that they would have to apply for the reward after fulfilling the other required obligations. The condition to make a second purchase was similarly stated three times in ads (b) and (c); however, each reference was in small text and placed underneath large headlines or subtitles that emphasised the Welcome Reward and its monetary value. The condition to make a second purchase was also stated within the dynamic graphic on the second slide. Whilst we acknowledged that the text was in large font, it did not appear on screen for the duration of the ads, and because of that, we considered it was not sufficiently clear that another purchase was necessary in order to be eligible for the reward.Because the ads implied that consumers had already fulfilled the necessary requirements to receive the “Welcome Reward”, we concluded that the ads breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 3.23 (Free).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Webloyalty International Ltd t/a Complete Savings, Argos Ltd, Trainline.com Ltd t/a Trainline, and Papa John’s (GB) Ltd t/a Papa John’s to ensure that future marketing communications made it clear to consumers that to obtain the free cashback or “Welcome Reward” they had to enter into a paid monthly subscription and actively claim the reward. We also told Trainline and Papa John’s to ensure that future marketing communications made sufficiently clear that it was necessary to make a second purchase in order to be eligible for the reward.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/webloyalty-international-ltd-a24-1248087-webloyalty-international-sarl-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Sainsbury's Supermarkets Ltd t/a Sainsbury's,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An Instagram story posted by Kayleigh Johnson, @kayleighjcouture, seen on 29 June 2024, featured a box with the question “Are you going to breastfeed? If not what formula will you use?”. Text underneath stated, “I will definitely try but much like with Caleb I’m not putting pressure on it. It didn’t really work out with him (although I did manage to give him lots of colostrum) so we did switch to formula – I’ll link the one we used! […] We’ve also got some of the pre-made mini bottles for the hospital bag. Ps – not here for any judgement or ‘breast is best’ comments. Fed is fed, end of. Caleb is well ahead of developmental ‘targets’ and a healthy boy so I have no shame in formula feeding whatsoever.” Underneath, an affiliate link titled “Formula we use” linked to a product page on Sainsbury’s website for an infant formula milk powder.","Two complainants challenged whether the ad: 1. breached the Code, because it was a marketing communication for infant formula; and 2. was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication.","1. Sainsbury’s Supermarkets Ltd (Sainsbury’s) acknowledged that the ad should not have appeared, because marketing for infant formula was prohibited, and the product should not have been promoted by the influencer. They took immediate action to remove the ad. Sainsbury’s said they did not have any involvement in the creation of the content of the post, but understood they were jointly responsible for the post. They explained that Ms Johnson was working with the affiliate network Stylink (Stylink Social Media GmbH). Sainsbury’s used the affiliate platform CJ (Conversant Europe Ltd). Sainsbury’s said they could not block affiliates from generating links to products on their website from a technical perspective. Instead, when Stylink signed up to the CJ affiliate platform they would have agreed to comply with CJ’s terms, which stated that users of the platform were responsible for compliance with the requirements of all relevant legislation in the UK. Sainsbury’s considered it was therefore also Stylink’s responsibility to adhere to the relevant legislation and the CAP Code. Additionally, when being onboarded onto Sainsbury’s affiliate programme, via the CJ platform, Stylink would have agreed to comply with Sainsbury’s own specific terms and conditions. Sainsbury’s said they were in the process of updating those terms and conditions to more clearly outline how their partners should ensure compliance with all relevant consumer protection legislation and the CAP Code. This would include terms that outlined prohibited categories which should not be advertised by affiliates, such as infant formula. All affiliates would have to accept those terms when they were uploaded to the platform, and failure to comply with the terms would lead to removal from Sainsbury’s affiliate programme. Kayleigh Johnson said she was not aware that it was prohibited to market infant formula. If she had known this, she would not have generated the affiliate link. She removed the ad.Stylink Social Media GmbH t/a Stylink explained that Stylink operated as a publisher on various affiliate networks, which collaborated with retailers to enable influencers to create affiliate links. Stylink re-created those affiliate links into their deeplinks to facilitate tracking for their influencers, who acted as sub-publishers. Stylink’s platform listed retailers with whom they had a partnership, along with the retailer’s pence-per-click-rate. Influencers could see a retailer’s website where all products were shown.Stylink was signed up to Sainsbury’s affiliate programme through the CJ affiliate platform. The product links were provided from Sainsbury’s website and created in CJ. Stylink did not make technical checks on the product links provided by Sainsbury’s (or other retailers), as their procedure relied on the networks and retailers to block any unsuitable products. They considered it was the retailers’ and networks’ responsibility to assure Stylink, as a publisher, that they could not create links to such products. Stylink did, however, monitor for compliance through random daily sampling of created links. They also had policies in place to prevent the promotion of products that violated advertising regulations. Their terms and conditions, and their guidelines, were regularly communicated in various ways to influencers who signed up to their network, including when they were onboarded onto the network. That included passing on information about the ASA’s Advertising Codes.They said they did not want their creators to inadvertently promote prohibited products and would take steps to address that. They would also work closely with their retail partners, including Sainsbury’s, to ensure that restricted products were not made available to be used as affiliate links. Conversant Europe Ltd t/a CJ said that Stylink was a publisher that operated a platform for people to promote brands via social media and websites. Publishers must agree to the terms of CJ’s Publisher Service Agreement (PSA). Those terms included that they must comply with all relevant legislation and the rules of relevant regulatory authorities. Advertisers could also add specific terms when they agreed to work with a publisher, which publishers must review and accept in order to work with that advertiser. CJ expected all publishers to understand and comply with the terms of the PSA, and with the relevant legislation under which they operated. Active compliance monitoring of affiliate content was the responsibility of the advertiser. Where advertisers brought breaches of the PSA to CJ’s notice, CJ could take action by reversing any commission earned by the publisher on the ad or link that incurred the breach. If the breach was sufficiently severe, they would end their relationship with that publisher. They confirmed that in this case, the ad was quickly removed, and no commission had been earned. Therefore, no further action was taken beyond a warning to the publisher to remind them of their contractual obligations to CJ and to Sainsbury’s. Sainsbury’s had since submitted new terms and conditions to CJ which gave more specific guidance to publishers about the CAP Code and other relevant legislation. 2. Sainsbury’s said it appeared that Ms Johnson had used a label in the top left-hand corner of the story, but that it was not clear and prominent. They acknowledged it was not clearly labelled as an ad.Kayleigh Johnson said she typically always included “Aff” or “Ad” when using affiliate links, so was not sure why she had not done so in this instance. Stylink said they consistently informed their influencers through various means, including during onboarding, on social media and in newsletters, that they must use the label “#Ad”. They also were told to include a link to the Stylink Instagram account so that Stylink could check the content, and to mention the brand to which the affiliate link related. Influencers who did not use “#Ad” or instead used “#Aff” were warned, and in the worst cases they prevented influencers from using the network.","1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that, except for those in a scientific publication or, for the purposes of trade before the retail stage, a publication of which the intended readers were not the general public, marketing communications for infant formula were prohibited. In the ad, Ms Johnson referenced that she had formula-fed her first child and had linked to a product listing on Sainsbury’s website for the infant formula milk she had used. The ASA considered that by including an affiliate link to an infant formula product, the ad promoted infant formula. We welcomed Ms Johnson and Sainsbury’s actions to remove the ad. However, because the ad had the effect of marketing infant formula to the general public, which was prohibited under the Code, we concluded that it breached the Code.On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 15.10 (Infant and follow-on formula). 2. Upheld Notwithstanding that the ad should not have included an affiliate link to an infant formula product, we also reviewed whether the Story was identifiable as an ad.The CAP Code required that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and that they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context.The link to the infant formula product was an affiliate link. That meant Ms Johnson would receive a commission for any click-throughs to the product listing on Sainsbury’s website. We considered the commercial nature of the affiliate content should have been made clear in the ads.It appeared that the word “Aff” was stated in the top-left hand corner of the Story, but it was placed directly behind the text “baby #2”. “Aff” could hardly be seen and was likely to be overlooked by those who saw the ad, particularly in the context of an Instagram story which was displayed for only five seconds. We therefore considered the “Aff” label was not sufficiently prominent. Furthermore, we considered that the label “Aff” was unlikely to be understood by most consumers to be a shortening of the word “affiliate”, and that even the word “affiliate” as a standalone label was unlikely to be sufficient to make clear that the story contained an affiliate link and was therefore an ad.Because the label “Aff” in the ad was neither sufficiently prominent nor sufficiently clear as an identifying label, we concluded the ad was not obviously identifiable as such and did not make clear its commercial intent, and therefore breached the Code .On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Sainsbury’s Supermarkets Ltd and Ms Kayleigh Johnson to ensure their future ads did not have the effect of marketing infant formula. We also told them to ensure that affiliate links were obviously identifiable as marketing communications and made clear their commercial intent upfront, for example, by including a clear and prominent identifier such as “#ad”.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/sainsbury-s-supermarkets-ltd-g24-1252121-sainsbury-s-supermarkets-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Suntory Global Spirits UK Ltd,,"A post on Bowmore Single Malt Whisky’s Facebook page, seen on 9 May 2024, featured text stating, “Time to reset. Discover a rich experience. An opportunity to escape, indulge and be truly present in the moment, in partnership with Aston Martin. This is captivating Islay: [weblink]”. An embedded video within the post featured different scenes of a man and a woman driving around Islay in an Aston Martin car visiting various places at different times of day and night. There was a mix of driving and non-driving scenes. Both individuals were shown driving the car at various points, with the other sitting in the passenger seat. One scene featured an image of the Bowmore distillery. In another scene, whisky was shown being poured into a bottle, followed by the characters holding glasses containing whisky and bringing them to their noses as though smelling the whisky and being about to taste it. Other scenes showed them in different places on the island at different points in time and wearing different outfits, including one scene where they were shown holding hands whilst in the car.",,"Suntory Global Spirits UK Ltd t/a Bowmore Single Malt Whisky (Bowmore) and Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd t/a Aston Martin said there was no direct link between drinking alcohol and driving in the ad. They believed the scenes featuring alcohol would not be interpreted as directly chronological or linked to scenes featuring the vehicle and/or driving. The ad was divided into many parts, with the scenes jumping between different days/times and locations. Therefore, they believed any reasonable viewer would understand that those activities occurred at separate times. They explained that Aston Martin, in partnership with Bowmore, offered consumers a “Captivating Islay” experience which comprised a chauffeur-driven tour of the Isle of Islay in an Aston Martin and a tour of Bowmore distillery, including food, refreshments and a tasting session.The ad was a story-telling film, one minute 36 seconds long, designed to promote the partnership and the experience. It featured characters visiting a number of locations over the course of several days, edited in a way that was non-chronological. The non-linear narrative was made clear to the viewer, as the characters were shown in a range of different outfits at various locations, in various weather conditions and at various times of day, over the course of what must have been several days. In a brief two-second sequence towards the end of the ad, the characters were shown in the distillery decanting whisky from a barrel, filling a glass bottle, and sitting and smelling the whisky without tasting it (the first distillery scene). They accepted that some viewers might infer that the couple had tasted the whisky, but said it had been a deliberate creative decision, by taking a responsible approach not to show the characters consuming the whisky. The sequences before the first distillery scene showed the Aston Martin driving away from the camera at night; the two characters standing in a wooded area, among bracken, in daytime; and the same two characters wandering on moorland, again in daytime. The actors were wearing different clothing in all of those scenes. Aston Martin and Bowmore considered that made it clear that it was not part of a linear narrative. They believed there was nothing in the ad to suggest that driving had taken place after whisky had been consumed. They pointed out that the characters were not shown driving to or from the Bowmore distillery and that they were wearing different outfits in the scenes immediately before and after the first distillery scene.In the shots following the first distillery scene, the man was shown running on the beach, the couple were then shown sitting harbourside with the Bowmore distillery in the background and were also shown leaning against the parked car on the beach. There were only two scenes that featured the car, following on from the first distillery scene. Both were brief, neither showed any driving and both were presented through lighting, clothing and sequencing as happening on a separate day or at a separate time. In each of those scenes, the couple were shown wearing different clothing to what they had worn in the distillery, indicating that those scenes occurred on a different day or time. None of the driving scenes in the ad occurred after the first distillery scene.The couple were then shown back in the wooded area taking a photo, holding hands in the car in close-up and embracing at night-time, before the woman was again shown, briefly, appraising a glass of whisky (the second distillery scene), after which the Bowmore and Aston Martin logos appeared on-screen and the background faded to black. They pointed out that the characters were not shown driving the car immediately before the second distillery scene and there were no further scenes featuring the car after that second distillery scene as that was the final shot. They therefore believed viewers were unlikely to conclude that the woman would have been driving after that scene. Furthermore, in each of the driving scenes, the characters were either wearing different clothing to what they had worn at the distillery, or an external shot of the car was used (so viewers could not see what the characters were wearing). They believed those factors established a clear separation in time between the distillery visit and the driving scenes.They did not believe that driving was a strong focus of the ad. They acknowledged there were at least two scenes showing the car driving along the beach and at least four scenes showing the car driving along different roads. However, only 17 seconds out of the one minute 36 seconds of the ad showed driving and the ad contained 42 non-driving scenes, of which 32 did not feature the car at all. They also highlighted that alcohol was not seen inside the car at any point or alongside car keys, unlike some ads which had previously been investigated and upheld by the ASA. Bowmore and Aston Martin said the ad had been removed. Facebook said they had investigated the matter and confirmed that the content was no longer available in the UK.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications that referred to alcoholic drinks must be socially responsible. It also stated they must not link alcohol with driving.The ad featured a sequence of scenes showing a couple in various places on the island of Islay at various times of the day or night, likely to be understood to take place over several days. The scenes were presented in a non-linear fashion, denoted by different weathers, locations and clothing. We also acknowledged that, in the two scenes featuring whisky being poured and appraised by the couple they were not seen drinking the whisky and the ad did not expressly show them driving after having consumed alcohol. We considered the ad did, however, imply that they were going to taste the whisky after appraising it, so viewers were likely to infer that the couple had consumed whisky as part of their experience. We considered that driving was a strong focus of the ad, particularly in the context of a collaboration which was presented “in partnership with Aston Martin”, a well-known car brand. There were at least two scenes showing the car driving along the beach and at least four scenes showing the car driving along different roads. Some of the scenes featured the inside of the car and showed either the man or woman driving at different times. Other scenes showed the couple leaning against the car whilst on the beach. The scenes that featured the car were regular, even if collectively they made up a small portion of the ad, and in those scenes, the car was a prominent feature. We considered that because the scenes were not shown in a linear sequence, it was not clear to viewers at which point in time the various scenes ensued, and the ad did not give a clear indication that no driving had taken place after the distillery visit part of the experience when it was inferred that whisky was consumed. For example, it did not show the couple ending the day with the whisky tasting session and not being required to drive anywhere afterwards. We considered that given the brief individual scenes, their non-linear presentation and the fast-paced jumping between scenes, viewers were unlikely to notice that the characters were wearing different clothing at the distillery visit compared to in other scenes and that, of itself, did not provide a sufficiently clear separation between the driving scenes and the distillery visit. For those reasons, we considered there was not a clear separation between the couple driving in the ad and the whisky being poured and appraised, indicating that they were going to drink it. We therefore concluded that the ad linked alcohol with driving and was irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 18.1 and 18.12 (Alcohol).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Suntory Global Spirits UK Ltd t/a Bowmore Single Malt Whisky and Aston Martin Lagonda Ltd to ensure that future ads did not irresponsibly link alcohol with driving.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/suntory-global-spirits-uk-ltd-a24-1244842-suntory-global-spirits-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Trav Expert Ltd t/a Travelcrew,,"A website for Travel Crew, www.travelcrew.co.uk, a retailer of flights and holidays, seen on 25 April 2024, had a search function which enabled consumers to search according to date and destination.",,"Trav Expert Ltd t/a Travel Crew said their website was static and did not update in real time.

They said prices were stated as “from” to indicate that the price advertised was a starting price for flights on that route but that availability changed rapidly and the starting price advertised might not be available when a customer tried to book. Travel Crew said the advertised prices included taxes but that, depending on the airline and the flight chosen, additional fees and surcharges might apply. They said they aimed to provide clear information to consumers on those potential additional costs.","Upheld The ad listed search results for flights from several airlines to the destination chosen. Prices were advertised as “from” prices followed by the text “avg. return per person”. Prominent text directly underneath each price stated “Call Now” followed by a telephone number.

In the absence of any other explanatory information in the ad, the ASA considered consumers would expect to have a reasonable chance of purchasing the flights at the prices advertised. We acknowledged that Travel Crew were an agent and did not provide flights directly themselves. Nevertheless, we considered they needed to hold evidence which showed that the prices advertised were genuine and not misleading. We had not seen that evidence. In addition, there was no information in the ad which stated explicitly that availability was limited and that prices were subject to change, nor was there anything to say when the advertised prices were last checked (therefore, how long since the prices were valid). We also noted Travel Crew’s response that additional fees and surcharges might apply. The CAP Code stated that quoted prices must include non-optional taxes, duties, fees and charges that applied to all or most buyers. We considered therefore that the advertised prices must include all non-optional fees relevant to each airline and flight. It was not sufficient for information about such charges, or information about limited availability, when prices were last checked and that they were subject to change, to be stated on a separate page. Because we had not seen evidence from Travel Crew that the prices advertised were genuine and included all non-optional fees and charges, and because the ad did not state when prices were last checked, that they were subject to change, and that availability was limited, we therefore concluded that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.9 and 3.10 (Qualification) and 3.17, 3.18 and 3.22 (Prices).","We told Trav Expert Ltd t/a Travel Crew to ensure that they held evidence to show that advertised prices were genuine and included all non-optional taxes, duties, fees and charges that applied to all or most buyers. In addition, if availability was not updated in real time, they needed to ensure their ads stated prominently when prices were last checked, that availability was limited and that prices were subject to change.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/trav-expert-ltd-a24-1243260-trav-expert-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on W8 Tech Cyprus Ltd t/a Seeking,,"A paid-for Reddit ad for Seeking.com, a dating website, was seen on 16 July 2024. Text in the ad stated, “Seeking.com is where successful men go to date beautiful women. Welcome To Seeking. The Best Site For Luxury Dating. Trusted By Over 40 Million Members.” The ad contained a video that featured a grey-haired man in a business suit sitting on a beach, looking at a photo on his phone of a woman. He then looked to the right to see four young women in bikinis and swimwear running up the beach towards him. He threw his phone up in the air and jumped up; one of the women winked at him as she passed. He ran down the beach, whilst being chased by the women. The ad then showed the mobile phone with text that stated, “BE THE CATCH!” whilst in the background, the man and four women could be seen falling to the ground and giggling could be heard. Text on the phone then stated, “DATE ON SEEKING.COM. JOIN FREE”. The ad ended with the man sitting on the beach and text on the screen that stated, “4:1 WOMEN TO MEN IN REAL LIFE”.",,,"Upheld The CAP Code stated that advertisements must not include gender stereotypes that were likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence. CAP guidance said that ads may feature people undertaking gender-stereotypical roles, but they should take care to avoid suggesting that stereotypical roles or characteristics were always uniquely associated with one gender. We noted that the aim of the ad was to communicate the specific dating services that Seeking.com offered, of matching “successful men” with “the most beautiful women”, in a humorous way. However, we considered that the contrast in the ad between the smartly, and fully dressed grey-haired man in a business suit and the younger women chasing him along the beach, partially dressed in bikinis and swimwear, implied a disparity in status and seriousness between the man and the women, and perpetuated stereotypes that men held value due to intelligence and business success, whereas women held value as objects, related to their physical appearance. Whilst we noted that the claims “BE THE CATCH!” and “4:1 WOMEN TO MEN IN REAL LIFE” reflected the high ratio of women to men on the Seeking.com website, we also considered that these claims, seen together with the other elements of the ad, implied that the man was a prize for multiple, beautiful women to fight over, and that he could take his pick from any of a number of beautiful, younger women. We also considered that the ad reinforced the stereotype that young, attractive women wanted to date older, successful men because of their wealth and status. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad perpetuated sexist and negative gender stereotypes and was likely to cause harm and widespread offence. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social Responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and Offence).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told W8 Tech Cyprus Ltd t/a Seeking.com to ensure that they did not portray sexist or negative gender stereotypes in future marketing communications.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/w8-tech-cyprus-ltd-a24-1252606-w8-tech-cyprus-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Ashlen Inc,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ‘closing down’ claims for product ranges in social media ads. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. See also related rulings published on 9 October 2024. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad for Ashlen, an online jewellery and clothing retailer, seen in July 2023, featured images of hair pins in the shape of swords, alongside text stating “Sadly, we are closing our sword hair pin collection. Last chance, everything 60% off!”. A link stated, “Shop Now” alongside text stating “Ashlen.co SWORD HAIR PIN 60% OFF WHILE STOCKS LAST!!”.","The ASA understood that the sword hair pin collection was still available to purchase on Ashlen’s website several months later, challenged whether the: 1. claim “we are closing our sword hair pin collection” was misleading; and 2. absence of a closing date for the promotion in the ad breached the Code.",Ashlen Inc did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Ashlen’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. We considered the claim “Sadly, we are closing our sword hair pin collection. Last chance […] while stocks last” would be understood by consumers to mean that the sword hair pin collection was going to be withdrawn from their website and that they should respond soon if they wanted to purchase the items in the collection before they became unavailable. The ad appeared in July 2023. Further paid-for ads that featured the claim that the sword hair pin collection was closing had appeared over the subsequent 12 months, with one ad still active in July 2024. Additionally, the sword hair pin collection was still available for purchase on Ashlen’s website in July 2024, 12 months after the original ad appeared and had not therefore been withdrawn. For those reasons, we considered that the claim “we are closing our sword hair pin collection” was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading advertising). The CAP Code required that ads for promotions must communicate all applicable significant conditions or information where the omission of such conditions or information was likely to mislead. Closing dates for promotions must be included in marketing communications if they were likely to influence consumers’ decision or understanding about the promotion. The Code also required that promoters must be able to demonstrate that the absence of a closing date would not disadvantage consumers.The ad promoted a closing-down sale and included references to “Last chance” and “Shop Now” but did not specify a closing date. We considered that the duration of the promotional period was information likely to influence consumers’ understanding or decisions about the promotion and was therefore a significant condition, the absence of which was likely to mislead. Furthermore, Ashlen had not demonstrated that the absence of a closing date did not disadvantage consumers. We therefore concluded that the ad breached the Code on that basis. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.17.4.a and 8.17.4.c (Significant conditions for promotions).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Ashlen Inc to ensure that their future marketing communications did not mislead consumers by stating that collections were closing down if that was not the case.

ASA Ruling on British Telecommunications plc t/a BT,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on mid-contract price rises, identified for investigation following complaints received. See also related rulings published on 9 October 2024.","A webpage on the BT website www.bt.com, seen in May 2024, featured the headline “Get Ultrafast Full Fibre 100 for only £29.99 a month”. Smaller text under the main headline stated, “Prices rise each year on 31 March by £3. 24 month [sic] contract.” Six full-fibre broadband packages were listed under the headline. Text for each of the packages stated the download speed, cost and length of the contract. Smaller text directly under the individual prices stated, “Increases 31 March 2025”. At the bottom of the page, under the subheading “The legal stuff”, text stated, “On 31 March each year the monthly price shown for broadband plans will increase by £3 […] Out of bundle charges will increase by 5%. All prices shown are in contract [sic] prices. Please note the cost of other services you take from us may increase or decrease while you are a BT customer. See bt.com/prices-explained for details”.",The complainant challenged whether the presentation of the mid-contract price increases was misleading.,"British Telecommunications plc t/a BT believed that the qualification “Prices rise each year on 31 March by £3. 24 month [sic] contract” met the ASA guidelines, because it made clear when the price would increase, by how much it would increase, and immediately followed it with the monthly price and upfront cost information. Regarding the claims seen for the six full-fibre broadband packages, BT said they had stated when the prices would increase, but accepted that the legal information had been included in a dropdown box at the bottom of the page, instead of being included directly within the six listed package details. They intended to amend the ads so that the full statement was included below the pricing panels for each broadband package, as per ASA guidance.","CAP Guidance stated that the presence of and, if applicable, the nature of mid-contract price increases, were material information that consumers needed in order to make an informed transactional decision. Consequently, marketers were required to ensure that advertising for services that included mid-contract price increases included such information and that it was presented clearly and prominently. The guidance also stated that asterisks or links, which linked to information more than one ‘step’ below the price claim, were unlikely to give adequate weight to the significance of material information. The ASA assessed the ad in question against the Code. The ad included a headline claim that stated, “Get Ultrafast Full Fibre 100 for only £29.99 a month”. Smaller text underneath stated, “Prices rise each year on 31 March by £3. 24 month [sic] contract”. The ad then described different broadband packages alongside the corresponding price per month of each package. Those prices were immediately followed by statements which stated that prices would increase on 31 March 2025. While we felt that consumers would understand from each individual package’s information that the monthly price would be fixed until that date, we noted that the detailed price rise information was presented at the top of the screen in considerably smaller text than the headline claim, and also it was not directly beneath the headline claim. We considered that the placement and size of the price rise information was likely to be overlooked by consumers, who would want to scroll down the page to engage with the details of the individual broadband packages on offer. We therefore did not consider that it would be clear to them how, or by what means, the monthly charge would be affected after that date. We understood that all of the advertised broadband packages were subject to mid-contract price increases, and that on 31 March each year the monthly price would increase by £3. We considered that information was material to a consumer’s decision to purchase or engage further with each of the packages. While we acknowledged that smaller text at the top of the page mentioned the £3 price rise, and that text stated that the monthly price would increase on 31 March, the listings of the broadband packages did not provide information explaining the nature of the increase. We considered this to be material information which should have been included in the details of each offer. We then considered the qualification located at the bottom of the webpage under the heading “The legal stuff”. The qualification explained that the monthly cost of each package would increase by £3 on 31 March each year. However, because that material information was not included within the listings for each broadband package, we considered that it had not been prominently or clearly displayed. Furthermore, we considered that if consumers did not scroll down past the information on the broadband packages, the information included in the qualification would likely have been overlooked because of its placement at the bottom of the page. Because the presentation of the mid-contract price increases was not presented clearly, we concluded the ad was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.10 (Qualification), and 3.17 and 3.18 (Prices).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

Please note the cost of other services you take from us may increase or decrease while you are an EE customer"".",The complainant challenged whether the presentation of the mid-contract price increases was misleading.,"EE Ltd said that the price rise information had been included below the postcode availability checker. It had also been re-stated on the webpages that appeared after consumers entered their postcodes. EE also said that the price increases which applied to the three plans seen in the ad were stated above the detailed information for each of the three broadband packages, and that the date of the price increase had been included immediately after the monthly price was stated for each of the packages. They said they had also included the price rise information in detail below the table of available plans. They believed that approach was compliant with ASA requirements.","CAP Guidance stated that the presence of and, if applicable, the nature of mid-contract price increases, were material information that consumers needed in order to make an informed transactional decision. Consequently, marketers were required to ensure that advertising for services that included mid-contract price increases included such information and that it was presented clearly and prominently. The guidance also stated that asterisks or links, which linked to information more than one ‘step’ below the price claim, were unlikely to give adequate weight to the significance of material information. The ASA assessed the ad in question against the Code. The postcode checker webpage included the claim “Ultra reliable broadband £29.99 monthly”, followed by a box in which consumers could enter their postcode. The subsequent webpage, seen after a postcode had been entered, described various broadband packages alongside the corresponding price per month of each package. The prices seen in the individual boxes for each of the packages were followed by statements which stated that the price would increase on 31 March. We considered consumers would understand that the monthly price would be fixed until that date. However, we considered that neither webpage made it clear to consumers how, or by what means, the monthly charge would be affected after that date. We understood that all of the advertised broadband packages were subject to mid-contract price increases, and that each March, the monthly price would increase by £3. We considered that information was material to a consumer’s decision to purchase or engage further with each of the packages. While we acknowledged that text on both webpages indicated that the monthly price would increase on 31 March, we considered that neither page made clear the nature of the price increases after that date. We acknowledged that both webpages contained further information which stipulated the nature of the price rise. However, we considered the text on the postcode checker webpage, which stated that prices would increase by £3 each year was significantly smaller and removed from the main headline price claim, was easy to miss due to its placement under the postcode checker box. We therefore considered that it had not been clearly and prominently presented to consumers. We also assessed the text near the top of the broadband package webpage, which similarly stated that prices would increase by £3 each year. We acknowledged EE’s comments that they had included specific information about the price rise amount above the individual package details, to try to make clear to consumers that all packages were subject to the price rise. However, we considered that the information was not as prominent or as large as the information for each broadband package. We also noted that it was not located close to the price claims, which we considered did not give adequate weight to the significance of such information. The text near the top of the webpage was located underneath a box which contained information on EE mobile phone contract savings. We considered that this text was easy to miss due to its size and positioning under that information. We also noted that the information concerning the price increases did not remain visible as the webpage was scrolled down, meaning that the packages could potentially be viewed while the specific price increase information was not visible on-screen. We further noted that the listings of the individual broadband packages did not provide information explaining the nature of the price increases, which we considered to be material information that should have been made clear to consumers considering the price claims in those listings. We therefore considered that information which detailed the nature of the price rise had not been prominently or clearly displayed. We then considered the qualification located at the bottom of the broadband package webpage under the heading “The legal bit”. The qualification explained that the monthly cost of each package would increase on 31 March each year and outlined the nature of that price increase; specifically, that it would increase by £3. Again, because that material information was not included within the listings for each broadband package, and because we did not consider that it was given equal prominence to the price claim within the webpage, we considered that it had not been prominently or clearly displayed. Furthermore, we considered that if consumers did not scroll down past the information on the broadband packages, the information included in the qualification would likely have been overlooked because of its placement at the bottom of the page. Because the presentation of the mid-contract price increases was not presented clearly, we concluded the ad was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.10 (Qualification), and 3.17 and 3.18 (Prices).","The ad must not appear again in its current form.

Free Baby Box worth over £50!”.","The complainant, who believed the image in the ad was not representative of what consumers actually received, challenged whether the ad was misleading.","Fanfinders Ltd t/a Your Baby Club UK explained that the contents of their baby boxes changed regularly depending on stock. They said it was not feasible to update their marketing communications to accurately reflect what was contained in the baby box on any given week. Your Baby Club UK also said that all their ads contained the text ""Box contents subject to change, image for illustration purposes only"" or ""Contents may vary, and are for illustration purposes only"". However, the nature of the platform meant that how the text appeared could vary based on factors such as what device they were viewed on, the ad placement and other factors also outside Your Baby Club UK’s control.They said their website was very clear on the exact contents of the box and its value. Therefore, everyone who ordered a baby box understood exactly what they were getting.","The ASA considered that consumers would likely understand from the ad, which included an image of various baby items, that the baby box they would receive contained the items in the image. We considered the use of the claims “Your baby box…” and “Free baby box…”, which appeared with the accompanying image of the items and no qualifying text, implied that the items a consumer received would be no different from those presented in the ad. We further acknowledged Your Baby Club UK’s comment that their website featured a page with the details and contents of the baby boxes. However, we understood that consumers needed to register with Your Baby Club to access this page, and we received no documentary evidence that the landing page for the ad in question contained an accurate description of the items in the baby box. Given that the image was not an accurate representation of what was received, we concluded that the ad was misleading.

ASA Ruling on Kerry Foods Ltd,,"A video on demand (VOD) ad for Strings & Things, seen on Channel 4 on Demand on 8 May 2024, featured a child jumping into her mum’s shopping bag to eat a packet of Cheestrings. She was then seen floating in a fictional world of Cheestrings. The ad ended with the well-known cartoon cat Garfield, holding cutlery as he said, “Wait for it”. Text on-screen and a voice-over said, “This summer win hundreds of prizes, including a Garfield movie themed trip to California. With Cheestrings and our new pizza flavour. Get a slice of the Garfield action”. Garfield was then seen eating a pizza and said, “Bury me in cheese”. Small print on-screen said, “purchase necessary, promotional packaging and receipt required, online entry only, 21+, ends 28/7/24, T&Cs apply”.","The complainant, who believed the ad was for a product that was high in fat, salt or sugar (a HFSS product ad) that was targeted through its content directly at pre-school or primary school children, challenged whether it breached the Code because it included a:","1. & 2. Kerry Foods t/a Strings & Things believed that the ad was not targeted at pre-school or primary school children, or children of any age, either through the content of the ad or through its scheduling and targeting. They said the target audience was parents, which was reflected by the ad placing the mother, the person who purchased the Cheestrings product, as the central character. They pointed out that the ad opened with the mother putting away the weekly shopping, which they further believed demonstrated that she was in charge. They said the ad, which then went on to bring to life the Cheestrings product the mother had purchased for her child, was ‘grown up’ in tone and believed it was clearly intended for an older audience. Strings & Things said the section of the ad featuring Garfield informed viewers of the opportunity to win a family holiday as well as other family-orientated prizes, which they believed again showed that the target audience was parents. They added that the character of Garfield was deliberately chosen because of his appeal to adults. They said Garfield originated in the 1970s within a comic strip syndicated to newspapers, the content of which featured predominately adult themes and ideas. They said they intended for the ad to appeal to adult viewers through a sense of nostalgia for the character of Garfield, rather than to appeal directly to children. They reiterated that the ad had in no way been targeted directly at pre-school or primary school children. Strings & Things said the disclaimer seen throughout that section of the ad, which stated only those aged 21+ were able to enter the promotion, was further evidence that the ad was not intended to be targeted at pre-school or primary school children. They added that the prizes were intended to be of interest to adults rather than children (e.g. a trip to California).They also said they put measures in place to ensure the ad was only viewed by its intended audience, which was parents. The ad was only broadcast on on-demand channels age-gated to logged-in users who were 16 years of age and over, and/or was scheduled not to appear in or around programmes commissioned for under-16s. Furthermore, they said the platform where the ad was seen, Channel 4 on Demand, used various parental controls which further decreased the likelihood of young children viewing the ad. Strings & Things said they double-checked the platform’s metrics and understood that the audience who used it was almost exclusively adults. They therefore believed it would have been highly unlikely that any children (and particularly pre-school or primary school aged children) would have seen the ad. They said that great care had been taken to ensure the ad was responsible and targeted at parents, and not children. They confirmed that the campaign had finished; they had no plans to broadcast the ad again.","The CAP Code required that HFSS product ads that were targeted through their content directly at pre-school or primary school children (under-12s) must not include a promotional offer. That rule applied to all HFSS product ads whether or not they had been targeted in such a way as to direct them to people aged over 16. The ASA therefore firstly assessed whether the ad was for a HFSS product; secondly, whether the ad featured a promotional offer; and thirdly, whether the content of the ad was targeted directly at pre-school or primary school children.The ad was for Cheestrings, which was a HFSS product, and was therefore a HFSS product ad. It referred directly to a prize promotion and was therefore a HFSS product ad that featured a promotional offer. We then assessed whether it was targeted directly at pre-school or primary school children through its content. We considered that the product itself would have been of interest to some pre-school and primary school children. The ad featured a young girl floating in a shopping bag, surrounded by several giant Cheesestrings. A life-size Cheesestring was then seen playing the saxophone. A voice-over repeatedly sang the phrase “Strings & Things” in a childish-like manner. The ad then transitioned into the promotional section, in which the well-known cartoon cat Garfield was seen eating a pizza. He was also seen riding a cartoon dog and he enthusiastically said, “Bury me in cheese”. Whilst the character of Garfield was first introduced in the 1970s, the timing of the ad coincided with the release of a new Garfield animated film, which had a ‘U’ rating and was likely to be popular with under-12s. We considered those elements of the ad would have also been engaging or appealing to under-12s. Although we acknowledged the prize promotion, which involved winning a trip to California, would have been appealing to adults, we considered that most of the ad’s content, imagery and tone, as described above, would have been engaging and appealing to children under the age of 12. For those reasons, we considered the ad was, through its content, targeted directly at pre-school and primary school children. We therefore concluded that the ad, which was for a HFSS product and through its content was directly targeted at pre-school and primary school children, breached the Code by including a promotional offer. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 15.14 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code stated that HFSS product ads that were targeted directly at pre-school or primary school children through their content must not include licensed characters or celebrities that were popular with children. That rule applied to all HFSS product ads whether or not they had been targeted in such a way as to direct them to people aged over 16. As stated above, the ad was for a HFSS product which, through its content, was targeted directly at pre-school or primary school children. We therefore considered whether the ad featured a licensed character that was popular with children. The ad featured Garfield, which we understood was a licensed character. As stated in point 1., although the original character was created in the 1970s, the new U rated Garfield animated film being released around the time the ad was broadcast meant the character was likely to be known by and popular with under-12s. We concluded that the ad, which was for a HFSS product that was targeted through its content directly at pre-school or primary school children, included a licensed character popular with children and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 15.15 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Kerry Foods Ltd t/a Strings & Things to ensure that future ads for HFSS products, which were targeted through their content directly at pre-school or primary school children, must not include promotional offers or feature licensed characters popular with children.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/kerry-foods-ltd-a24-1244924-kerry-foods-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Moderny Inc t/a Moderny.co,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ‘closing down’ claims for product ranges in social media ads.

We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. We considered the claim “Sadly, we are closing our bamboo flatware collection […] Last chance to shop everything up to 60% off!” would be understood by consumers to mean that the bamboo flatware collection was going to be withdrawn from Home Décor Emporium’s website and that they should respond soon if they wanted to purchase the items in the collection before they became unavailable. The ad appeared in January 2024. Further paid-for ads that featured the claim that the bamboo flatware collection was closing had appeared over the subsequent six months, with one ad still active in July 2024. Additionally, the bamboo flatware collection was still available for purchase on the Home Décor Emporium website in July 2024, six months after the original ad appeared and had not therefore been withdrawn. For those reasons, we considered that the claim “we are closing our bamboo flatware collection” was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading advertising). The CAP Code required that ads for promotions must communicate all applicable significant conditions or information where the omission of such conditions or information was likely to mislead. Closing dates for promotions must be included in marketing communications if they were likely to influence consumers’ decision or understanding about the promotion. The Code also required that promoters must be able to demonstrate that the absence of a closing date would not disadvantage consumers. The ad promoted a closing-down sale and included references to “Last chance” but did not specify a closing date. We considered that the duration of the promotional period was information likely to influence consumers’ understanding or decisions about the promotion and was therefore a significant condition, the absence of which was likely to mislead.Furthermore, Home Décor Emporium had not demonstrated that the absence of a closing date did not disadvantage consumers. We therefore concluded that the ad breached the Code on that basis. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.17.4.a and 8.17.4.c (Significant conditions for promotions).",The ad must not appear again in its current form.

ASA Ruling on Pall Mall Medical (Manchester) Ltd t/a Pall Mall Cosmetics,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An Instagram post by Pall Mall Cosmetics, seen on 14 July 2024, included text that stated, ""[…] take a moment to read about Hannah, our lovely patient […] who underwent Rhinoplasty surgery. Swipe to the end for her amazing transformation! […]"". The ad featured a carousel of five images. The first image showed a side profile of Hannah. The second image included text that stated, “Rhinoplasty is something I’ve always thought about but never been brave enough to do. I saw Lillie Haynes post about her positive experience and it gave me the push I needed to go for it. Hannah Moult, Rhinoplasty patient”. The third image included text that stated, “The process was so easy, especially surgery day, it was fab. The level of care I got was outstanding and I felt I was in extremely safe hands. I wish I’d done it sooner”. The fourth image included text that stated, “My new nose has actually been life changing. For anyone considering rhinoplasty…just go for it. You won’t regret it. I’ve never been happier and more confident!”. The fifth image included two side profile photos of Hannah’s face with text that stated, “Before” and “After”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad was irresponsible because it: 1. trivialised the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery; and 2. linked confidence and happiness to undergoing cosmetic surgery.,"1.& 2. Pall Mall Medical (Manchester) Ltd t/a Pall Mall Cosmetics said that they had a proven track record as a responsible cosmetic surgery provider with 14 years of safe practice. They placed a strong emphasis on informed consent and encouraged patients to approach surgery with caution. They had consistently been responsible and transparent in their advertising, using pinned posts across their platforms to clearly outline the potential risks of surgery and the importance of conducting research prior to making important decisions. They said that the content of their ad was based on the personal experience and words of their patient, Hannah, who had willingly shared her story. Hannah’s comments about her surgery being “so easy” and “life-changing” and the references to confidence and happiness reflected her personal journey, and her satisfaction with the results. They said that her description of the process as “easy” referred to the straight-forward nature of the process, from enquiring through to the day of surgery, and the care she received, not the surgical procedure itself and they believed that consumers would make that distinction. Additionally, the testimonial made clear that Hannah’s decision to undergo surgery was a long and considered one. They did not intend for the ad to suggest that cosmetic surgery was a decision to be taken lightly or was risk free. The wording that they believed the ASA considered problematic only appeared on slide four of a five-slide carousel, and not in the caption of the ad. Most consumers only interacted with the initial slide and accompanying caption. However, they recognised that the way in which they had presented this content overall may have unintentionally conveyed a message that was against ASA guidelines, particularly concerning the portrayal of surgery as a straightforward decision, and the linking of happiness and confidence directly with the procedure. They understood they had fallen short of the ASA’s guidelines in this case, for which they apologised and had consequently removed the ad and provided further staff training to ensure that future communications were aligned with ASA guidelines.","1.Upheld The CAP Code required marketing communications to be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. CAP Advertising Guidance on Cosmetic interventions stated that marketers should avoid irresponsibly describing cosmetic interventions as “safe” or “easy”, because it was likely that all such interventions would carry some level of risk to the patient. It also stated that testimonials and endorsements should not detract from the seriousness of the intervention. The ad included claims that “the process” of getting cosmetic surgery was “so easy, especially surgery day, it was fab”; “anyone considering rhinoplasty…just go for it. You won’t regret it”; and seeing someone else have a positive experience of the surgery “gave me the push I needed to go for it”. We considered that these claims portrayed the decision to have cosmetic surgery as one that could be taken lightly and quickly, and the procedure, including the “surgery day” itself as straight-forward and without risk. We considered that the ad detracted from both the seriousness of the decision to undertake a cosmetic intervention and the seriousness of the surgery itself. We therefore concluded that the ad trivialised the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery and was irresponsible. On this point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Responsible advertising). 2. Upheld The ad included the claim “My new nose has actually been life changing. For anyone considering rhinoplasty…just go for it. You won’t regret it. I’ve never been happier and more confident!”. We considered that the ad implied that by changing their physical appearance via cosmetic surgery, an individual could significantly improve their happiness and confidence. We considered the ad risked exploiting people’s insecurities around body image, particularly those with insecurities relating to the shape of their nose. Because of the way in which the ad significantly linked confidence and happiness to cosmetic surgery, we concluded that it was irresponsible. On this point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Responsible advertising).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Plusnet plc,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on mid-contract price rises, identified for investigation following complaints received. See also related rulings published on 9 October 2024.","A webpage on the Plusnet website www.plus.net, seen in May 2024, featured headline text that stated, ""Cash-saving Full Fibre broadband deals"". Text under the headline stated, ""Award-winning packages from just £24.99 a month and no activation fee. You'll be quids in. Increases 31 March"". A box under the text allowed consumers to enter their postcode to check availability. Smaller text beneath that box stated, ""Price rises each year on 31 March by Consumer Price Index rate of inflation + 3.9%"". Once a postcode was entered a page with various broadband packages was displayed. Text at the top of the page stated, ""Full Fibre straight to the home"", under which smaller text stated, ""Price rises each year on 31 March by Consumer Price Index rate of inflation + 3.9%"". Five full-fibre broadband packages were listed further down the page. Text for each of the packages stated the download speed, cost and length of the contract. Smaller text directly under the individual prices stated, “Increases 31 March”. At the bottom of the page, under the subheading “Here's the legal bit”, text stated, “You can see our full residential terms and conditions here"", and included a hyperlink to the T&Cs. Further text stated, ""The price for broadband, line rental, call plans and call charges will be increased each March from 2022 by the Consumer Price Index rate of inflation published by the Office for National Statistics in January of that year plus 3.9%. Other prices, content and terms may also change during your contract. See our CPI Plus 3.9% Guide"", with another hyperlink to further information.",The complainant challenged whether the presentation of the mid-contract price increases was misleading.,"Plusnet plc said they had immediately qualified the monthly price seen in the headline claim on the postcode checker webpage, and that qualification stated the monthly price would increase on 31 March and had included the longer qualification in the same panel. Regarding the price statements seen within the five full-fibre broadband packages, Plusnet said they understood that ASA guidance suggested it would be acceptable to link to price rise information immediately below any pricing claims. Rather than repeat such information for each of the broadband packages, they believed it would be more helpful for consumers to state the price increase in text above the broadband package details, so that it was seen before the monthly pricing was stated. Because they believed they had made the text more prominent by placing it above the monthly price claims, they did not think it had been necessary to include an asterisk to link to the copy. They believed that their approach complied with the ASA guidance.","CAP Guidance stated that the presence of and, if applicable, the nature of mid-contract price increases, were material information that consumers needed in order to make an informed transactional decision. Consequently, marketers were required to ensure that advertising for services that included mid-contract price increases included such information and that it was presented clearly and prominently. The guidance also stated that asterisks or links, which linked to information more than one ‘step’ below the price claim, were unlikely to give adequate weight to the significance of material information. The ASA assessed the ad in question against the Code.The postcode checker webpage included the claim “Award winning packages from just £24.99 a month”. The subsequent webpage, seen after a postcode had been entered, described various broadband packages alongside the corresponding price per month of each package. The prices seen for each individual package were immediately followed by statements that stated that the price would increase on 31 March. We considered consumers would understand that the monthly price would be fixed until that date. However, we considered that neither webpage made it clear to consumers how, or by what means, the monthly charge would be affected after that date. We understood that all of the advertised broadband packages were subject to mid-contract price increases, and that each March the monthly price would increase by the rate of inflation plus 3.9%. We considered that information was material to a consumer’s decision to purchase or engage further with each of the packages. While we acknowledged that information on both the postcode checker webpage and below the monthly prices for each of the broadband packages indicated that the monthly price would increase on 31 March, we considered that the text did not make clear the nature of the price increase after that date. In any case, we considered that it would not be clear to consumers what the statement “increases 31 March” on the postcode checker page actually referred to, given the way it was set out on the page. We acknowledged that both webpages contained further information which stipulated the nature of the price rise. However, we considered the text on the postcode checker webpage, which stated that prices would increase by the rate of inflation plus 3.9%, was significantly smaller, and removed from, the main headline price claim. Furthermore, we considered it would be easily overlooked due to its placement under the box in which consumers had to input their postcode. We therefore considered that it had not been clearly and prominently presented to consumers. Next, we reviewed the text at the top of the webpage which presented the five available broadband packages and similarly stated that prices would increase by the rate of inflation plus 3.9%. We acknowledged Plusnet’s comments that they had included information about the price rise amount above the individual package details, to try to make clear to consumers that all packages were subject to the price rise. However, we considered that the information was not as prominent or as large as information included for each of the individual packages, and we noted that it was not located close to the price claim, which we considered did not give adequate weight to the significance of such information. We also noted that the information did not remain visible as the webpage was scrolled down, meaning that the packages could potentially be viewed while the specific price increase information was not visible on-screen. We further noted that the listings of the individual broadband packages did not provide information explaining the nature of the price increases, which we considered to be material information which should have been made clear to consumers considering the price claims in those listings. We therefore considered that information which detailed the nature of the price rise had not been prominently or clearly displayed. We then considered the qualification located at the bottom of the broadband packages webpage under the heading “Here’s the legal bit”. The qualification explained that the monthly cost of each package would increase each March from 2025 and outlined the nature of that price increase; specifically, that it would increase by the rate of inflation plus 3.9%. Again, because that material information was not included within the listings for each broadband package, and because we did not consider that it was given equal prominence to the price claim within the webpage, we considered that it had not been prominently or clearly displayed. Furthermore, we considered that if consumers did not scroll down past the information on the broadband packages, the information included in the qualification would likely have been overlooked because of its placement at the bottom of the page. Because the presentation of the mid-contract price increases was not presented clearly, we concluded the ad was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.10 (Qualification), and 3.17 and 3.18 (Prices).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Plusnet plc to ensure that they made sufficiently clear that their broadband contracts would be subject to mid-contract price increases, and that information about the nature of such price increases was presented prominently.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/plusnet-plc-a24-1244740-plusnet-plc.html
ASA Ruling on PlymGlow Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A circular for a tanning salon, seen on 27 May 2024, featured the text “Benefits of Tanning” at the top of the ad, followed by two bullet points: “Prepares skin for UV exposure prior to holidays” and “Maintains healthy Vitamin D levels”. Further text stated, “Helps to Prevent”, followed by bullet points which listed “SAD, PMS and general depression”, “Skin disorders such as Psoriasis and eczema” and “Osteoporosis”.",Two complainants challenged whether the:,"1., 2. & 3. PlymGlow Ltd stated that they were unaware the claims might be problematic. They had been using them for years and believed they were accurate. They also provided links to three websites they believed supported some of the claims in their advertising. The first was a UK-based website specialising in selling commercial and home sunbeds, which said that sunbeds could boost Vitamin D levels. The second was for a charity and membership organisation for people affected by psoriasis. It stated that hospital-based light therapies using specific parts of the UV spectrum could reduce inflammation and therefore help psoriasis. However, it warned against general sunbed use, stating that sunbeds were ineffective for treating psoriasis and increased the risks of UV exposure. The third website was for a tanning salon in America, which claimed there were benefits to tanning.","The CAP Code stated that marketers must not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. For example, they must not offer specific advice on, diagnosis of or treatment for such conditions unless that advice, diagnosis or treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified health professional. The ad referred to “osteoporosis”, “psoriasis” and “depression”, which were conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. Therefore advice, diagnosis or treatment must be conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. The ASA had not seen evidence to show that PlymGlow’s tanning services were provided under the supervision of a suitably qualified health professional. We considered that in the absence of such a professional the ad discouraged essential medical treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. The ad therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.2 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). The ad included the claims that tanning “prepares skin for UV exposure prior to holidays” and “maintains healthy Vitamin D levels”. We considered these implied that using sunbeds could provide some health benefits, such as being an efficient way to maintain vitamin D levels and protect against further UV damage. It also claimed that sunbed use could prevent the conditions: seasonal affective disorder (SAD); premenstrual syndrome (PMS); and eczema. For such claims we expected PlymGlow to hold a high level of evidence, consisting of studies and trials which showed these benefits were obtained from sunbeds by humans. However, PlymGlow had supplied no evidence of that kind. We also took into account that NHS advice on the use of sunbeds was cautious. The advice warned that there was no safe or healthy way to get a tan, and that a tan did not protect skin from the sun’s harmful effects. It stated that the ultraviolet (UV) rays given out by sunbeds increased the risk of developing skin cancer and that many sunbeds gave out greater doses of UV rays than midday tropical sun. It linked to further information provided by the British Association of Dermatologists which stated, ""There are no potential health benefits that cannot be more safely and effectively obtained through other means, and any health benefits are debatable, thus such claims should be prevented"". Because we had not seen evidence that sunbeds could provide health benefits including the prevention of medical conditions, and in the context of the caution urged by NHS advice, we concluded that the claims in the ad that sunbeds provided health benefits were misleading and had not been substantiated. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, Medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). As explained above, given the potentially serious consequences for people who used sunbeds because they believed there would be health benefits, we concluded that, as well as not being substantiated, the claims were irresponsible. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Responsible advertising).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told PlymGlow Ltd to ensure they did not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. We told them to ensure their ads did not misleadingly or irresponsibly claim or imply that health benefits could be obtained from sunbeds, unless they had adequate evidence, or that sunbeds could help to prevent medical conditions.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/plymglow-ltd-g24-1248081-plymglow-ltd.html

Whilst we acknowledged that text indicated that the monthly price was applicable until April 2025, we considered the main body of the ad did not make clear that the price would increase after that date, nor did it provide information explaining the nature of such an increase, both of which we considered to be material information. We then considered the qualification located at the bottom of the webpage linked to by the statement “until April 2025*” in the main body of the ad. The qualification explained that the monthly cost of each package would increase after April 2025 and outlined the nature of that price increase - specifically, that it would increase by the rate of inflation plus 3.7%. However, because that material information was not included within the main copy of the ad or given equal prominence to the price claim within the webpage, we considered that it had not been prominently or clearly displayed. Furthermore, we considered that if consumers did not click the “until April 2025” link, the information included in the qualification would have likely been overlooked because of its placement at the bottom of the webpage.

Each price was followed by an obelisk symbol which directed consumers to further information found underneath the list of packages, and again at the bottom of the page. However, the price claims and other information provided for each individual package did not state that the monthly price would be subject to an annual increase, nor the nature of that increase. We understood that all of the advertised contract packages were subject to mid-contract price increases, and that after April 2025, the monthly price would increase by the rate of inflation plus 3.9%. We considered that information was material to a consumer’s decision to purchase or engage further with each of the packages. We acknowledged that information regarding the price rise was included at the top of the page, before the listing of the packages, and that the information stayed pinned to the top of the page, in a banner and in bold text, as it was scrolled down. However, the banner was also on a white background, the same colour as the rest of the webpage, which we considered meant it blended into the page, and was not immediately distinguishable for consumers. Notwithstanding that, we considered that the information was not located sufficiently close to the monthly prices stated within the main body of the ad. As such, we considered it was not sufficiently clear from the ad that the featured monthly prices would increase before the end of the contract period, nor did the banner prominently provide information explaining the nature of such an increase, both of which we considered to be material information. We then considered the qualification located under the contract package information at the bottom of the webpage, linked to by the obelisk symbols after the prices in the individual package’s boxes in the main body of the ad. The qualification explained that the monthly cost of each package would increase each April after April 2025 and outlined the nature of that price increase; specifically, that it would increase by the rate of inflation plus 3.9%. However, because that material information was not included within the main copy of the ad, nor given equal prominence to the price claim within the webpage, we considered that it had not been prominently or clearly displayed. Furthermore, we considered that if consumers did not scroll down past the information on the airtime packages, the information included in the qualification could easily have been overlooked because of its placement beneath the main body of the ad, and at the bottom of the page. Because the presentation of the mid-contract price increases was not presented clearly, we concluded the ad was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.10 (Qualification), and 3.17 and 3.18 (Prices).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Telefonica UK Ltd t/a O2 to ensure that they made sufficiently clear that their contracts would be subject to mid-contract price increases, and that information about the nature of such price increases was presented prominently.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/telefonica-uk-ltd-a24-1244736-telefonica-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Virgin Media Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on mid-contract price rises, identified for investigation following complaints received. See also related rulings published on 9 October 2024.","A webpage on the Virgin Media website www.virginmedia.com, seen in April 2024, detailed three different packages for “M250 Fibre” broadband. Headline text at the top of the page stated “M250: like 200Mb broadband, but faster”. Under the subheading “Here’s what you can get at your home”, text stated, “*Monthly price shown will increase each April from April 2025 by the Retail Price Index rate of inflation announced in February each year plus 3.9%”. Information about each package was displayed underneath, detailing what was included in each package, and the respective monthly cost, followed by an asterisk. Under each price there was a link titled “Find out more”. When the link was clicked, a list appeared comparing the offer prices to the current full prices. As the page was scrolled down, the information that the advertised prices would increase by the Retail Price Index rate of inflation plus 3.9% each year remained pinned to the top of the webpage. Text further down the page stated, “*Monthly price of Virgin Media’s main services and O2 Airtime Plan will increase each April from April 2025 by the Retail Price Index rate of inflation announced in February each year plus 3.9%. Doesn’t apply to any add-ons you may have selected, out-of-bundle charges or admin costs, which may increase separately. See www.virginmedia.com/prices and www.o2.co.uk/prices for details”. That text was repeated at the bottom of the ad under a subheading entitled “The legal stuff”.",The complainant challenged whether the presentation of the mid-contract price increases was misleading.,"Virgin Media Ltd said they believed the ad was clear and transparent in relation to the annual mid-contract price increases and, in their view, did not breach the CAP Code.They highlighted that text at the top of the ad stated that the price would increase each April by the Retail Price Index rate of inflation announced in February of each year plus 3.9%, and that statement followed users down the webpage as they scrolled. As such, it enabled consumers to be able to see the price rise information when they were looking at the pricing of the different broadband packages, and each price for the multiple listings was linked to the visible price rise explanation by asterisk. Virgin Media also said they did not include any claims that stated or implied the price would apply for the minimum term and so therefore did not contradict the qualification or banner.","CAP Guidance stated that the presence of and, if applicable, the nature of mid-contract price increases, were material information that consumers needed in order to make an informed transactional decision. Consequently, marketers were required to ensure that advertising for services that included mid-contract price increases included such information and that it was presented clearly and prominently. The guidance also stated that asterisks or links, which linked to information more than one ‘step’ below the price claim, were unlikely to give adequate weight to the significance of material information. The ASA assessed the ad in question against the Code. The ad described different broadband packages alongside the length of each contract (18 months) and the corresponding price per month of each package. The boxes containing the individual details for the different broadband packages did not contain any information stating that those prices would only be applicable until April 2025. Each price was followed by an asterisk which directed consumers to further information found underneath the list of packages. This information was repeated at the bottom of the page and it also referred to the pinned “sticky banner”, which remained visible as the page was scrolled down. However, the price claims and other information provided for each individual package did not state that the monthly price would be subject to an annual increase, nor the nature of that increase. We understood that all of the advertised broadband packages were subject to mid-contract price increases, and that after April 2025, the monthly price would increase by the rate of inflation plus 3.9%. We considered that information was material to a consumer’s decision to purchase or engage further with each of the packages. We acknowledged that information regarding the price rise was included at the top of the page, before the listing of the packages, and that the information stayed pinned to the top of the page, in a “sticky banner”, as it was scrolled down. However, the banner was also on a white background, the same colour as the rest of the webpage, which we considered meant it blended into the page, and was not immediately distinguishable for consumers. Notwithstanding that, we considered that the information was not located sufficiently close to the monthly prices stated within the individual broadband package’s listings. We further noted that the listings of the individual broadband packages did not provide information explaining the nature of the price increases. As such, we considered it would not be sufficiently clear to consumers considering the price claims in the various packages that the featured monthly prices would increase before the end of the contract length, nor did the “sticky banner” prominently provide information explaining the nature of such an increase, both of which we considered to be material information. We then considered the qualification located under the broadband package information at the bottom of the webpage, linked to by the asterisks after the prices in the individual broadband package boxes in the main body of the ad, and the “sticky banner”. The qualification explained that the monthly cost of each package would increase each April after April 2025 and outlined the nature of that price increase; specifically, that it would increase by the rate of inflation plus 3.9%. However, we considered that it had not been sufficiently prominently or clearly displayed, despite the presence of the “sticky banner”. Furthermore, we considered that consumers would not necessarily click on the “Find out more” link, or scroll to the bottom of the page, meaning that the information included in the qualification could easily have been overlooked because of its placement beneath the main body of the ad, and at the bottom of the page.Because the presentation of the mid-contract price increases was not presented clearly, we concluded the ad was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.10 (Qualification), and 3.17 and 3.18 (Prices).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Virgin Media Ltd to ensure that they made sufficiently clear that their broadband contracts would be subject to mid-contract price increases, and that information about the nature of such price increases was presented prominently.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/virgin-media-ltd-a24-1244733-virgin-media-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Sunspot Tours Ltd t/a Mercury Holidays,,"A national press ad for Mercury Holidays, seen in the Daily Mail on 11 May 2024, featured various offers for a package holiday to Madeira. Text at the top of the ad stated, “Experience 5 [star symbol] in Madeira […] A week ‘Ultra’ All-Inclusive from £689 [asterisk symbol]”. A box near the bottom of the ad, labelled “Winter Warmers 2024/25”, included a table of prices for holidays available from November 2024 to February 2025. Each month included three columns showing the price for one week, three weeks, and a fourth week. Each third column for November, January and February all listed the fourth week as “FREE”. Small print at the bottom of the ad stated, “4th week free applies to stays 01/11-15/12 and 03/01-28/02”.","The complainant, who was unable to book a holiday with a fourth week included as free within the dates seen in the ad, challenged whether the price claims were misleading.","Sunspot Tours t/a Mercury Holidays said that consumers had been able to book a four-week (28 night) holiday via their website with the fourth week included for free. They provided two examples of eligible holidays for dates between November to December 2024 and January to February 2025, which they believed demonstrated that the fourth week was free for consumers as advertised.","The CAP Code stated that products must not be described as “free” if the cost of response, including the price of a product that the consumer must buy to take advantage of the offer, had been increased, except where the increase resulted from factors that were unrelated to the cost of the promotion. The ad included several package holiday deals, and a table which included “Winter Warmers” deals for 2024-25. The table listed one, three and four week stays from November 2024 to February 2025. In all except the December row, the fourth week was shown as being “FREE”. The ASA considered that consumers would therefore understand that in the months of November 2024, and January and February 2025, when a three-week holiday was purchased, an additional week would be included for no extra cost as part of the promotional “Winter Warmers” offer. In particular, we considered that consumers would expect that because the fourth week was listed as being “free”, they would pay the same price for a four-week holiday as they would for a three-week holiday in that timeframe. We noted that when the complainant had tried to redeem the “free” offer and book a four-week holiday, they were quoted a cost greater than the advertised price of a three-week holiday to the same destination within the same timeframe. For November 2024 and January 2025, a one-week stay was shown as costing £709 and a three-week stay as £2,129. For January 2025, one week was listed as costing £689 and three weeks was £2,119. However, when the complainant had attempted to book a four-week holiday, they found they were quoted over £500 more than the advertised price of a three-week stay for the same period. We understood that the three-week holidays listed in the ad were subject to a separate 15% “early bird” discount. However, because that discount did not apply to the cost of a four-week holiday, it meant that the overall price of a four-week stay was more than that of a three-week stay and accounted for the higher price quoted to the complainant. Because we considered that consumers would expect the cost of a four-week holiday to be the same as that for a three-week holiday, if the fourth week was advertised as “free”, and as that was not the case, we concluded therefore that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.17, 3.24, and 3.24.2 (Misleading advertising).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Sunspot Tours Ltd t/a Mercury Holidays that they should not describe a holiday as including a “free” period of time, if the overall cost increased when adding the extra time period.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/sunspot-tours-ltd-a24-1245080-sunspot-tours-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on The BLAC Awards (UK) C.I.C t/a The BLAC Awards,,"Five ads for The BLAC Awards, an organisation that promoted achievements in the black community: a. A Facebook post on The BLAC Awards page, seen on 26 December 2023, included a video that featured text stating “THE BLAC AWARDS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ROYAL AIR FORCE PRESENTS THE 2024 HONOURS OF DISTINCTION CANDIDATES”. b. A second Facebook post, on The BLAC Awards page, seen on 12 February 2024, included a video that featured text stating “THE BLAC AWARDS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ROYAL AIR FORCE PRESENTS THE 2024 NOMINATION CATAGORIES”. c. A third Facebook post, on The BLAC Awards page, seen on 21 March 2024, stated “THE BLAC AWARDS in partnership with the ROYAL AIR FORCE” and featured the RAF logo. d. A fourth Facebook post, on The BLAC Awards page, seen on 14 May 2024, featured the RAF logo. e. The BLAC Awards website, www.blac.org.uk, seen on 20 May 2024 featured the RAF logo on the home page landing screen and as a headline banner on other webpages. The main home page also featured text stating “IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ROYAL AIR FORCE” and displayed the RAF logo.","The Royal Air Force (RAF), who asserted The BLAC Awards did not have a current official partnership with the RAF, challenged whether the ads were misleading.","The BLAC Awards (UK) C.I.C t/a The BLAC Awards said that they believed they had the authority to use the RAF’s logo since July 2020, when the RAF sponsored a BLAC Awards event. They provided a series of emails regarding that event, including emails from the RAF that discussed The BLAC Awards’ use of the RAF logo on its website. They believed there was no end time to the arrangement. They had been in contact with representatives of an advertising agency, who confirmed their legitimate right to use the materials based on the evidence they held. They explained that when they had first worked with the RAF in 2020, the RAF had provided them with logos to use on their website and awards and had sponsored and attended their events in recent years. They believed that since 2022 they had received mixed messaging from the RAF regarding ongoing sponsorship and involvement.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not claim that the marketer, the marketing communication or the advertised product had been approved, endorsed or authorised by any public or other body if it had not.The ASA considered that consumers would understand the inclusion of the RAF logos in ads (a) to (e) and the claim “The BLAC awards in partnership with the Royal Air Force” in ads (a), (b), (c) and (e) to mean The BLAC Awards had an official current partnership with the RAF and was authorised to use its logo. We understood that there had previously been a sponsorship arrangement between The BLAC Awards and the RAF, in 2020, and as part of that The BLAC Awards had permission to use the RAF logo and branding. However, we had not seen any evidence to suggest that the partnership was ongoing and that, at the time the ads were seen, The BLAC Awards was authorised to include the RAF’s logo in its advertising and we understood from the complainant that it was not. We therefore concluded that the use of the RAF logo in ads (a) to (e) and the claim “The BLAC Awards in partnership with the RAF” in ads (a), (b), (c) and (e) were misleading. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.50 (Endorsements and testimonials).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told The BLAC Awards (UK) C.I.C t/a The BLAC Awards not to claim or imply in their advertising that they had an official partnership with the RAF or any other public body if they had not, including by using their logos.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/the-blac-awards--uk--c-i-c-a24-1246302-the-blac-awards--uk--c-i-c.html
ASA Ruling on Adidas UK Ltd,"This case forms part of a wider piece of work on ads for affiliate marketing using intermediaries, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA.","An Instagram story on Tanya Burr’s account, @tanyaburr, posted on 8 April 2024, featured Ms Burr taking a selfie in front of a mirror wearing a trench coat and Adidas trainers. Text on the photo stated, “I lived in this trench last Autumn and am very happy to be back in it for Spring”. Below the text, a clickable link labelled “OUTFIT LINKS” directed to Ms Burr’s LTK shop page.",The ASA challenged whether the story was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication.,"Adidas UK Ltd t/a Adidas said that they had not contracted Ms Burr, and had not previously worked on any paid campaigns with her. They confirmed that Ms Burr used an affiliate link on Adidas products that had originated from their affiliate network AWIN. They said that they always required their creators to disclose paid content when they were included in their paid campaigns. Braveheart International Ltd t/a ALIGNE, who sold the trench coat featured in the ad, said that when they entered into paid partnerships, they set out specific guidelines to ensure that the word “AD” was clearly visible. They said that they did not have a paid partnership with Tanya Burr, and confirmed that they agreed to gift her the coat in October 2023 at her own request. They said that they did not directly authorise the link to their site via the affiliate platform LTK, and instead worked with AWIN as one of their affiliate platforms, through which they had accepted LTK as a partner platform. They did not pay or have a contract with LTK. Instead, AWIN held the funds content creators generated through a 30-day period, and released them to LTK. They said that they did not have visibility on LTK regarding who added links to their site, and where the commission had originated from. They said that the only information they had through LTK was traffic that came from Shop LTK to their Shopify site. They had not observed a spike in sales in the 7 days following Ms Burr’s post. Ms Burr said that she would take immediate steps to amend her advertising in line with the ASA rules. She stated that she was not paid by Adidas or ALIGNE, and did not have any contractual agreements in place with either brand. She confirmed that she had purchased the Adidas trainers herself and was gifted the ALIGNE trench coat in October 2023. rewardStyle Inc t/a LTK said that they were a tech-enabled partner for creator guided shopping. They provided the technology that allowed influencers (creators) to create shoppable posts that drove trackable sales for brands. They noted that they were not the advertiser, nor the creator, and instead they provided the platform for which brands and creators could connect their products. The core service they offered was to allow creators to host “shops” on the platform. Through their shoppable LTK links, creators could be compensated for their posts, and brands could track and grow engagement and sales. They said that they took compliance with advertising regulations seriously and had policies in place that required the creators to adhere to all relevant legal and ethical standards. They required creators to include disclosures in their social media posts. They also included marketing disclosures next to the affiliate links on their platform. They highlighted that they had thousands of creators, and it was not possible for them to read every post. However, they did monitor their platform, and in cases of non-compliance, they would take action. In relation to the story, they agreed that it should have included disclosure in compliance with their guidelines and contractual requirements. AWIN Ltd said that they operated as an affiliate marketing platform that connected advertisers and publishers (such as influencers) and provided the technology to track transactions that resulted from publisher referrals to the advertiser’s products. They had contractual agreements in place with advertisers and publishers that required them to act in compliance with relevant laws and regulations. They also offered advertisers and publishers tools such as a universal customisable disclosure solution for their links, called “admission” which allowed publishers to customise the disclosure text they wanted to display.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context.The ASA first assessed whether the Instagram story was an ad. We understood that Ms Burr had purchased the Adidas trainers herself. We further understood that she was gifted the ALIGNE coat, though in the absence of a contractual agreement with the brand, we considered that there was no editorial control over the story. However, the story included an affiliate link that directed to Ms Burr’s LTK shop page, which would earn Ms Burr commission when products were purchased through the links on the platform. The story was therefore a marketing communication for the purposes of the Code. We then assessed whether the ad was obviously identifiable as such. The ad was an Instagram story which featured a photo of Ms Burr taking a selfie with the text “I lived in this trench last Autumn and am very happy to be back in it for Spring”, together with a link labelled “OUTFIT LINKS”. We considered that consumers would understand the ad to be Ms Burr sharing with her followers a recommendation of a coat she wore frequently. We acknowledged that once consumers landed on Ms Burr’s LTK shop page, built-in text on the platform stated “Paid links”. However, this was only visible to consumers after they had engaged with the link.Because consumers therefore had to engage with the ad before it was made clear that Ms Burr would receive commission on purchases made via the links featured, we considered that this was insufficient to ensure that the story was obviously identifiable as an ad. We concluded that in the absence of a clear and prominent identifier, such as “ad”, the ad did not make its commercial intent clear from the outset and was not obviously identifiable as a marketing communication. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 (Recognition of marketing communications).","The ads must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Adidas UK Ltd t/a Adidas, Braveheart International Ltd t/a ALIGNE, and Ms Burr to ensure that their future ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications, that the commercial intent was made clear, and that identifiers such as “ad” were clearly and prominently displayed.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/adidas-uk-ltd-a24-1242252-adidas-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on DAMM 1876 LTD,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, of which was Upheld and one Not upheld.","Two Instagram reels on alcohol brand Estrella Damm’s own account: a. The first reel, posted 2 May 2024, featured an individual swimming in a pool. On-screen text stated, “Spring Vibes. Post de la Selva. 2024. Estrella Damm”. Bottles of beer were shown in a bowl as an individual walked by holding a bottle of beer. The ad then showed the individuals sunbathing by a pool, eating and playing table tennis. The next scene showed the individuals drinking bottles of beer on rocks by the sea and then jumping into the sea. The final scene showed a bottle of Estrella Damm beer. On-screen text stated, “Estrella Damm. The Beer of Barcelona”. b. The second reel, posted 13 June 2024, featured three women sunbathing and on-screen text that stated, “Our first Primavera Sound. Barcelona 2024. Estrella Damm”. The next scenes showed two of the women holding glasses of beer and then swimming in a pool. The three women were shown sunbathing, with a bottle of beer by the side of the pool. The ad then showed the women at the Primavera music festival meeting friends, with various scenes of them dancing and laughing. The next scene showed a group of people running into the sea and laughing together on the beach. One woman was then shown holding a bottle of beer outside and another sipped from a bottle of beer. The final scene showed the women with their suitcases getting into a taxi. On-screen text stated, “Estrella Damm. The Beer of Barcelona” and a bottle of Estrella Damm beer was shown.","1. The ASA challenged whether ad (a) breached the Code because it irresponsibly linked alcohol with an activity or location in which drinking would be unsafe. 2. The complainant challenged whether ad (b) breached the Code because it featured people who were, or seemed to be, under 25.","1. S.A. Damm t/a DAMM 1876 believed ad (a) did not promote unsafe or irresponsible drinking. They said the ad aimed to outline their brand’s link to Mediterranean culture by featuring a group of people enjoying a day on the Catalan coastline, which was characterized by pine groves and rocky bays. They said that while the individuals were shown drinking from bottles on the rocks and then swimming, it was never implied that the bottles were beer bottles. The scene was taken with a distant shot that blurred the bottles, making them unidentifiable to the audience and therefore breaking the link between drinking alcohol and swimming. They said that culturally in Spain, alcohol consumption was associated with particular moments of the day. For example, this was shown in the ad by the individuals drinking beer as an aperitif to lunch in the first seconds of the ad and then as an aperitif to dinner at the end of the ad. In those scenes the beer bottles were featured in close shots where their brand was clearly visible on the bottles. They explained that the ad was produced by one of their Spanish agencies where creatives were unfamiliar with UK ad regulation, and usually took the view that beaches or swimming were generally not considered as risk activities, particularly in the Mediterranean sea.They said they had deleted the ad and would not use similar images in the future. 2. DAMM 1876 said the models in ad (b) were all aged above 25 at the time of it being shot and they provided photographic identification for the models to confirm that. The ad showed a group of tourists experiencing their first time in Barcelona for the Primavera Sound music festival, of which DAMM 1876 was a sponsor and official beer brand. They explained that the ad was intended to appeal to youth culture in a broad sense, including to people in their thirties, which was a target group both for their brand and for Primavera Sound music festival, of which 33% of attendees were aged 25 to 35 and 33% were aged 35 and older. They believed that demonstrated that attending a music festival should not be deemed as adolescent behaviour, but rather, as a shared leisure choice amongst those over 25. They said it was often impossible to tell the age of individuals, for example, aged 20 to 28, and it would not be effective for an advertiser to use older models in order to avoid the risk of an individual with “youthful” looks being considered under 25.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not link alcohol with activities or locations in which drinking would be unsafe or unwise.The ad showed three individuals drinking from bottles on rocks near the sea and after drinking from the bottles one of the individuals was shown jumping into the sea and swimming. The ASA acknowledged that the shot of the three individuals drinking from bottles on the rocks was a distant shot, in which the labelling on the bottles was not clear. However, we considered that because clearly branded beer bottles were shown in the opening seconds of the ad, again in close-up shots while the individuals were eating lunch and lastly, in close-up shots at the end of the ad, it was clear that bottles of alcohol were shown in those scenes. As such, and in the overall context of an alcohol ad, we considered consumers were likely to understand that the individuals were also drinking alcohol on the rocks before jumping into the sea. We therefore concluded there was a clear link in the ad between drinking alcohol on the coastline and swimming, which were activities in which drinking was unsafe or unwise. As such, the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 18.12 (Alcohol). The CAP Code stated that people shown drinking alcohol or playing a significant role in a marketing communication for alcohol must neither be, nor seem to be, under 25 years of age. The ad featured individuals attending a music festival in Barcelona. We considered that, while attending a music festival could be viewed by some to be a youthful activity, festivals were generally not exclusively attended by those under 25. We also took into account the data provided by DAMM 1876, which stated that 33% of the attendees of the Primavera Sound music festival were aged 25 to 35 and 33% were aged 35 and older, which we considered was reflective of the notion that attending a music festival was not exclusively an under-25 occurrence. We also understood that the models featured in the ad were aged between 25 and 32 years. In addition, three of the models who played a significant role and who were shown holding bottles of alcohol and drinking them, were aged 25, 26 and 28. We therefore assessed whether those particular models seemed to be under 25 years of age and, in the overall context of the ad and given that their general appearance, although youthful, was not suggestive of being younger, concluded that they did not seem to be under 25 years of age. We investigated ad (b) under CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 18.16 (Alcohol), but did not find it in breach.",Ad (a) must not appear again in the form complained of. We told S.A. DAMM t/a DAMM 1876 to ensure that in their future advertising they did not link alcohol with swimming or other unsafe or unwise activities.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/damm-1876-ltd-a24-1250287-sa-damm.html
ASA Ruling on Dataverse Co.

The voice-over continued against a backdrop of casino graphics that included exploding gold coins, “Get the real Vegas experience and become a billionaire overnight with grand cash casino slots. Get in on collections, events and bonus games and the VIP system for extra rewards and bonuses. They have a huge welcome bonus to get you off to a strong start and they’re always adding more slots to play. Go download Grand Cash Casino Slots and start playing right now.” b. The second ad for the social casino game app “Grand Cash Casino Slots” featured an individual against a background of casino slot machines and, at the same time, slot machine sound effects could be heard in the background whilst the individual said, “Hey, look at me, what did I say? No”. On-screen text stated, “My husband every time we go to Vegas and I blow all of our money”. The ad then showed a different individual against a casino slot machine background who said, “So that’s why he made me switch to mobile slots so I could experience real life Vegas casinos from home and become a billionaire overnight.

Ltd t/a Gamehaus said the ads were independently created by TikTok influencers who had submitted their content in response to tasks Gamehaus had posted through the TikTok Creative Challenge, a programme that allowed content creators to earn money by making ad creatives for different brands. They confirmed that players of the game could not cash out any winnings for real-world money or tangible prizes. They said the game was designed for entertainment, and that all winnings were virtual with no real-world value. Gamehaus said it was crucial that players understood the app was not a gambling app where they could win real-world money or tangible prizes, and they aimed to make that clear through various means. They said they would enhance their review process to ensure that all submitted content aligned with their guidelines and clearly communicated the non-gambling nature of their games. They confirmed the ads had been withdrawn in the UK and gave assurances that the ads would not be used in the future. They said they would take measures to ensure their future advertising clearly communicated the non-gambling nature of the game to prevent any potential misunderstandings. TikTok said restrictions applied to the advertising of social casino games on their platform and that included the prohibition of content implying that users could earn real-world money or where direct comparisons to gambling were made. They said the ads had breached TikTok ad policies, and as such, they had removed the ads from their platform.","The ASA understood that social casino apps emulated slot machines or other casino-based games. However, we understood consumers were unable to win or withdraw any real-world money or tangible prizes from such apps, and, therefore, they were not gambling products. We further understood that, whilst real-world money was not required to play, there were in-game purchase options available which enabled consumers to buy in-game currency or additional gameplay features. Ads (a) and (b) featured gameplay footage which we considered was similar to the type of gameplay seen in casino-based slot games, in which it was possible to win and withdraw real-world money. The ads also included prize terminology, such as “huge welcome bonus”, “win massive prizes” and “extra rewards and bonuses”. We considered such text, along with the gameplay footage, implied that using the app was akin to playing on a mobile slot or real-life slot machine, which involved gambling and the potential to win real-world money. In addition, ad (b) featured an individual against a casino slot machine background, and we considered seeing the gameplay footage alongside the individual situated in a casino and adjacent to a slot machine, would further reinforce to consumers that Grand Cash Casino Slots was similar to traditional casino-based gambling. Furthermore, we noted the ads made direct comparisons to Vegas and the casino experience, for example ad (a) stated “Get the real Vegas experience” and ad (b), “I could experience real life Vegas casinos from home”, which we considered would be interpreted by consumers as indirect references to gambling. We therefore considered such comparisons would be understood to mean that the game was similar to playing a traditional slot machine whereby it was possible to win and withdraw real-world money.Both ads also referred to players of the game becoming billionaires within a short period of time; in ad (a) the voice-over stated, “[…] become a billionaire overnight”, and in ad (b) the individual shown playing the game said that they were also able to become a billionaire overnight, and encouraged others to “Become a billionaire like me” by playing Grand Cash Casino Slots. In both ads, becoming a “billionaire” was linked to the “real Vegas experience” offered by the app, and within that context, we considered consumers would understand the term literally and as a reference to winning real-world money. We therefore considered those references strengthened the impression that consumers could win real-world money or other tangible prizes.Ad (c) similarly featured gameplay footage which emulated slot machine games. The ad then showed the comparison of two bank account statements, “$215.89” and “$5,477.55”, as an individual said their bank account had increased from hundreds to thousands of dollars. We considered consumers would interpret that to mean the individual had won real-world money by playing Double Win Slots Casino. We acknowledged the individual also stated, “instead of wasting my real money” and “you don’t have to spend a single penny”. However, we considered that implied, whilst the game was free to play, consumers were still able to win real-world money. As such, we considered it was not sufficient to state that the game was free to play to override the impression that real-world money or tangible prizes could be won by playing Double Win Slots Casino.Similarly to ads (a) and (b), ad (c) included prize terminology references such as “huge payouts”, “hit a huge payout” and, again, directly referenced the Vegas casino experience with the text, “a true experience just like you’re in Vegas”, which we also considered strengthened the impression that consumers could win real-world money.We also considered the names of the apps “Grand Cash Casino Slots” and “Double Win Slots Casino” advertised in the ads. Both apps contained references to casino and slots, terminology we considered consumers would associate with gambling. In addition, we noted that real-world money was directly referenced in the name “Grand Cash Casino Slots” and considered that would further imply that it could be won and withdrawn. However, we understood that Grand Cash Casino Slots and Double Win Slots Casino were social casino apps and that neither real-world money nor prizes could be won through gameplay. We noted that there was no information provided to the consumer that it was not the case that real-world money or tangible prizes could not be won.Because we considered the claims and imagery featured in the ads, alongside the name of the apps, “Grand Cash Casino Slots” and “Double Win Slots Casino”, gave the impression that the apps were gambling products in which real-world money or tangible prizes could be won and withdrawn, we concluded that the ads were misleading and breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Dataverse Co.

ASA Ruling on Guang Zhou Shi Chen Ming Ke Ji You Xian Gong Si t/a MENGCOOL,"This case forms part of a wider piece of work on ads for affiliate marketing using intermediaries, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA.","Two Instagram stories on Jess Sheppard’s account @jessmsheppard, posted on 31 March 2024: a. The first Instagram story featured a photo of Ms Sheppard. An Instagram Q&A box was superimposed onto the photo, with the text “Love the hair claw [flower emoji] and the Gilet… please share [chain link emoji]”. A clickable Rstyle.me link labelled “GILET” appeared below the text, which directed to a TALA product page. b. The second Instagram story featured a similar photo of Ms Sheppard. An Instagram Q&A box was superimposed onto the photo, with a clickable Rstyle.me link labelled “MULTIPACK HAIR CLAWS” which directed to a MENGCOOL product listing on Amazon.",The ASA challenged whether the stories were obviously identifiable as marketing communications.,"Guang Zhou Shi Chen Ming Ke Ji You Xian Gong Si t/a MENGCOOL did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries in relation to ad (b). We Are TALA Ltd t/a TALA said in relation to ad (a) that they had never had a direct affiliate relationship with Ms Sheppard. The relationship was with the intermediary, LTK, who operated the Rstyle.me affiliate links. They stated that they (and any other brand using LTK) had no control or visibility over the influencers which signed up with LTK and published affiliate links into TALA via this platform. They had never directly provided Ms Sheppard with an affiliate link or paid her through those links. They had not asked Ms Sheppard to post this story, and had no knowledge or visibility of it, as they were not tagged in the content. Regarding their relationship with LTK, they said that they worked with many affiliate partners, one of which was LTK. They paid commission to LTK on a monthly basis, which was directly correlated with revenue generated through the platform. They had no control or insight into who posted affiliate links. They highlighted that LTK was the party that had a direct relationship with the affiliates and influencers, and that included managing adherence to platform rules and compliance with ASA regulations. They said that platforms like LTK did not notify brands when their products were used in affiliate links, and did not allow brands to control these links directly. Because of this, they considered that it was not possible for them to ensure compliance with the CAP Code, for ads that were not known to them. They reiterated that they took their ASA obligations seriously and took proactive measures to ensure compliance when working with influencers directly. However, they considered that because they had no awareness of the relevant story, it was not possible for them to exercise their reactive controls on the content. Ms Sheppard stated that she always disclosed her ads, and that the stories were not ads. She highlighted that she bought the items and attached evidence of the purchase of the hair claws. She confirmed that the stories did contain affiliate links, and stated that she would be willing to remove the stories from her highlights.rewardStyle Inc t/a LTK said that they were a tech-enabled partner for creator guided shopping. They provided the technology that allowed influencers (“creators”) to create shoppable posts that drove trackable sales for brands. They noted that they were not the advertiser, nor the creator, and instead they provided the platform for which brands and creators could connect their products. The core service they offered was to allow creators to host “shops” on the platform. Through their shoppable LTK links, creators could be compensated for their posts, and brands could track and grow engagement and sales. They said that they took compliance with advertising regulations seriously and had policies in place that required the creators to adhere to all relevant legal and ethical standards. They required creators to include disclosures in their social media posts. In relation to the stories, they agreed that the creators should have included disclosure in compliance with their guidelines and contractual requirements. Amazon Europe Core Sàrl said they had policies that applied to all creators in their affiliate marketing programme, Amazon Associates, to ensure that they made the appropriate disclosures in relation to affiliate links. Where they became aware of creators failing to meet their policies, they reminded them of their obligation to appropriately disclose affiliate links, asked them to update their posts, and monitored their accounts in future.","The ASA was concerned by Guang Zhou Shi Chen Ming Ke Ji You Xian Gong Si t/a MENGCOOL’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. Paragraph I(h) of the Scope of the Code stated that it applied to “advertisements and other marketing communications by or from companies, organisations or sole traders on their own websites, or in other non-paid-for space online under their control, that [were] directly connected with the supply or transfer of goods, services, opportunities and gifts […]”. In cases of affiliate marketing, both the brand business and the affiliate marketer were responsible under the Code, notwithstanding the fact that the ads may have been created solely by the affiliate without any input from the business themselves. The ASA first assessed whether the Instagram stories were ads. We understood that Ms Sheppard had stated that she had purchased the products herself and had not received payment or any other incentive from other parties. We also acknowledged that Ms Sheppard had no commercial relationship with TALA, and that the brand did not have any input in the content before it was posted. We had also seen no evidence that she had such a relationship with MENGCOOL. However, the stories included affiliate links that directed to a product page on TALA’s website and MENGCOOL’s product listing on Amazon. We understood that the affiliate links included in the stories would earn Ms Sheppard commission when products were purchased through the link. We therefore considered that the stories were directly connected with the supply of goods and were therefore marketing communications for the purposes of the Code. We understood that TALA had not had direct control of the way in which the affiliate links and related content were presented in ad (a). However, because they were the brand which benefitted monetarily from the affiliate marketing, we considered they were jointly responsible for the ad and its compliance with the Code. We then assessed whether ads (a) and (b) were obviously identifiable as such. The ads were Instagram stories from a Q&A by Ms Sheppard, where she had invited her followers to ask her questions. The stories were posted in response to the question “Love the hair claw [flower emoji] and the Gilet… please share [chain link emoji]”. We considered that consumers would interpret the stories to be an exchange of information between Ms Sheppard and her follower(s), in response to the question she had received. The context of the conversational nature of a Q&A was unlikely to make clear to consumers the commercial intent of the stories. Therefore, ads (a) and (b) needed to be clearly labelled as marketing communications. In the absence of a clear and prominent identifier, such as “Ad” we considered that ads (a) and (b) did not make their commercial intent clear from the outset and were not obviously identifiable as marketing communications. On these points, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 (Recognition of marketing communications).","The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Guang Zhou Shi Chen Ming Ke Ji You Xian Gong Si t/a MENGCOOL, We Are TALA Ltd t/a TALA, and Ms Sheppard to ensure that their future ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications, and the commercial intent was made clear, and that identifiers such as “ad” were clearly and prominently displayed. We referred MENGCOOL to CAP’s Compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/guang-zhou-shi-chen-ming-ke-ji-you-xian-gong-si-a24-1242267-guang-zhou-shi-chen-ming-ke-ji-you-xian-gong-si.html
ASA Ruling on Huel Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A post on Huel’s own Instagram account, seen on 3 April 2024, featured a video of Julian Hearn, company founder, speaking about their Daily Greens product. He stated, “You’ve been told your whole life to eat greens and a lot of people can’t get that amount of greens into their diet […] we’ve taken a very broad range of greens, so you get a product which is equally good, or in my eyes better, but you get it substantially cheaper.” The accompanying caption stated “Superfoods to supercharge your health. Huel Daily Greens is packed with […] gut-friendly probiotics. All the nutrients your body needs to thrive; Reduce tiredness and fatigue with 26 essential vitamins & minerals like iron; Excellent source of biotin and collagen to support smooth, healthy skin”.",The complainant challenged whether: 1. the comparison between “greens” and the advertised supplement was a comparative nutrition claim that complied with the Code; and 2. the claim that the product was “substantially cheaper” than an equivalent portion of greens was misleading and could be substantiated.The ASA challenged whether: 3. the general health claims and specific health claims in the ad complied with the Code.,"1. & 2. Huel Ltd explained the ad had been shortened due to an editing error. In the original full version of the ad, the comparison was made with the market-leading daily greens product; however, an error in editing left the impression that the comparison was with fresh green vegetables. Huel provided several tables which they believed substantiated that their Daily Greens product was “substantially cheaper” than the competitor product on a per serving basis, and that it was “equally good or better” due to the quantity of nutrients it contained. Regardless of the substantiation, Huel recognised the error fell short of their standards and confirmed they were taking steps to ensure it was not repeated. 3. Huel believed two general health claims, “Superfoods to supercharge your health” and “All the nutrients your body needs to thrive”, were accompanied by the specific health claims “Reduce tiredness and fatigue with 26 essential vitamins and minerals like iron” and “Excellent source of biotin and collagen to support smooth, healthy skin”. They said the specific health claims referred to nutrients that were important for the overall health of the body and were therefore adequate to support the general health claims.Regarding the claim “gut-friendly probiotics”, Huel accepted that was a general health claim and confirmed it would not be used in current or future ads unless accompanied by a relevant authorised specific health claim. Huel said the specific health claim “reduce tiredness and fatigue with 26 essential vitamins and minerals like iron” highlighted iron as a nutrient that contributed to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. They said it additionally communicated that the product contained 26 other essential vitamins and minerals. However, the ad only made a specific claim in relation to iron. Huel said the advertising claim “excellent source of biotin and collagen to support smooth, healthy skin” was based on an authorised health claim. They had amended its wording to aid consumer understanding, but believed the authorised claim had not been exaggerated. They had replaced “contributes to” with “support”, and “normal skin” with “smooth, healthy skin”, which did not imply any improvement to the normal state of skin. They had taken steps to amend their specific health claims in a compliant manner since previous engagement with the ASA .","The CAP Code required that only nutrition claims authorised on the Great Britain Nutrition and Health Claims register (the GB NHC Register) were permitted in marketing communications. A nutrition claim was defined as any claim which stated, suggested or implied that a food or drink had particular beneficial nutritional properties due to the number of calories, nutrients or other substances it contained, did not contain, or contained in reduced or increased proportions. Comparative nutrition claims must meet the conditions of use associated with the permitted claim and must compare the difference in the claimed nutrient to a range of foods of the same category. The ad made numerous references to “greens”; the ASA considered that the statements “you’ve been told your whole life to eat greens” and “a lot of people can’t get that amount of greens into their diet” would be understood by consumers as a reference to the colloquial phrase “eat your greens”, which was widely used as an imperative phrase or a reminder to consume an accepted amount of vegetables. We understood the phrase was sometimes used to describe green vegetables in particular. When describing the product in the ad, the founder stated, “we’ve taken a very broad range of greens” and then stated, “so you get a product which is equally good or […] better”. Within that context, we considered the claim “equally good or […] better”, would be understood as an implied comparative nutrition claim that the Huel Daily Greens had just as much or more overall nutritional content as an equivalent portion of green vegetables. However, there were no permitted comparative nutrition claims which related broadly to the overall nutritional content of a food. Permitted comparative nutrition claims related to specific nutritional properties of foods, such as their vitamin, mineral or fibre content. The advertising claim was therefore not a permitted comparative nutrition claim. In addition, we considered that a supplement drink and green vegetables did not fall into the same food category. We concluded that the comparative nutrition claim breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1, and 15.3 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). As mentioned above, we considered that the references to “greens” would be interpreted by consumers as references to fresh green vegetables. We considered that the phrase “we’ve taken a very broad range of greens […] but you get it substantially cheaper” would be understood as a comparison between Huel’s Daily Greens food supplement product and fresh green vegetables, and that the ad, therefore, claimed the advertiser’s product was cheaper than consuming a daily intake of fresh green vegetables. We acknowledged that the ad had been shortened from a longer video, and that the longer version had compared the advertiser’s product with a different greens supplement from a competing brand. However, the ad did not refer to a competing product, and we did not consider that the shorter version of the video, the ad subject to investigation, made that comparison. Instead, we considered that it implied to consumers that the Daily Greens product was cheaper than a portion of “greens”, rather than a similar competitor product. We assessed the substantiation provided to us. The data in the tables compared the number of servings per product, the price per serving, and the quantity of 12 different nutrients in both the Daily Greens and the competing product. However, because the evidence only compared the Daily Greens product with the competing product, we considered that it was not relevant to the claim in the ad as it would be understood by consumers. Because we had not seen evidence that the Daily Greens product was cheaper than a portion of greens, we concluded that, the claim that the product was “substantially cheaper” than an equivalent portion of greens was misleading and could not be substantiated. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation). The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the GB NHC Register were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health. Marketers could exercise some flexibility in rewording authorised claims, provided that the reworded claim was likely to have the same meaning for consumers as the authorised health claim, and the aim of the rewording was to aid consumer understanding, taking into account factors such as linguistic or cultural variations and the target population. Health claims must be presented clearly and without exaggeration. The relevant authorised specific health claim for iron was “Iron contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue”. We considered that the omission of the phrase “contributes to” altered the meaning of the claim such that the relationship between the iron in the product and the consumer’s health was overstated. Moreover, we considered the claim attributed the health benefit to iron and 25 other vitamins and minerals, but the Code required those vitamins and minerals to be named. In any case, we understood that the claim “contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue” was authorised in relation to only nine vitamins and minerals. We therefore considered that the claim “Reduce tiredness and fatigue with 26 essential vitamins & minerals like iron” did not have the same meaning as any authorised health claim and therefore breached the Code. The relevant authorised specific health claim for biotin was “Biotin contributes to the maintenance of normal skin”. We accepted that the advertiser had replaced the phrase “contributes to” with “support”, and we agreed that this retained the meaning of the authorised claim. However, we considered that by rewording the phrasing “maintenance of normal skin” with “smooth, healthy skin” did not convey the same meaning as the relevant authorised claim. We additionally noted the advertising claim “Excellent source of biotin and collagen to support smooth, healthy skin” attributed the health benefit to collagen as well as biotin, but there were no authorised specific health claims for collagen. We considered that the advertising claim did not have the same meaning as any authorised health claim and therefore breached the Code. The CAP Code also stated that general health claims could be made in relation to foods only if they were accompanied by a relevant specific, authorised health claim. General health claims were defined as those referring to a general benefit of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health related well-being. We considered the claims “Superfoods to supercharge your health”, “gut-friendly probiotics” and “All the nutrients your body needs to thrive” were general health claims because they referred to the general beneficial effects of the food supplement on health, or, in the case of “gut-friendly probiotics”, referred to a broad beneficial effect on the gastrointestinal system. We therefore considered that those claims were general health claims for the purposes of the Code that needed to be accompanied by specific authorised health claims. The advertiser had argued that they had accompanied those claims with the claims “Reduce tiredness and fatigue with 26 essential vitamins & minerals like iron” and “Excellent source of biotin and collagen to support smooth, healthy skin”. However, as referenced above, we considered those claims did not have the same meaning as any authorised health claims on the GB Register. The general health claims therefore were also in breach of the Code. Because the specific health claims in the ad did not meet the associated conditions of use, and the general health claims were not accompanied by specific authorised health claims, we concluded that those claims were in breach of the Code. On that point, the claims breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1, 15.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Huel Ltd to ensure that future marketing communications did not make non-permitted comparative nutrition claims, and where using permitted claims, only compared foods in the same category. We told them to ensure that they did not make comparative pricing claims, in the absence of adequate substantiation. We also told Huel to ensure that future marketing communications did not contain general health claims without accompanying them with specific authorised health claims that, if reworded, the specific health claims in their ads conveyed the same meaning as the authorised claim.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/huel-ltd-a24-1240834-huel-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Huuuge Global Limited t/a Billionaire Casino,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on paid-for gambling-like ads, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 25 September 2024.","Two paid-for TikTok ads for social casino game app “Billionaire Casino” seen in March 2024: a. The first ad featured a person in the front seat of a car who stated, “So I just got a brand-new Tesla because I stopped going to the casino and started playing Billionaire Casino instead”. The ad then showed a casino slot machine and graphics which included exploding gold coins and text that stated, “HUUUGE JACKPOT” as the person continued, “Billionaire Casino has over 200 slot games and a lightning wheel with rewards from gaming chips to treasures. They’ve got exclusive buffalo slots with wild gameplay and intense bonus rounds, plus a charm collection feature to boost your jackpot chances. If you join the Billionaire League, you and your friends can win massive prizes and climb the ranks. It’s all the casino fun without the casino fuss, so tap below to start downloading it now”. b. The second ad featured piles of gold coins and graphics which included a spinning roulette wheel. Voice-over and on-screen text throughout the ad stated, “HUUUGE CHANGES ARE HERE! Luxury Villa Winter Renovation, BIGGER PRIZES! IMPROVED REWARDS! BIGGER TICKET & LOTTERY PRIZES! SUPERIOR VAULT. MORE IN EVERY PURCHASE! HIGHER PRIZES ON BOTH WHEELS! AND MUCH MORE! All benefits are here to stay.”",The ASA challenged whether the ads misleadingly implied the social casino games were gambling products in which real-world money or tangible prizes could be won and withdrawn.,"Huuuge Global Ltd t/a Huuuge believed it was clear the social casino game app was not a gambling product in which consumers could win real money or real prizes. They confirmed that users could not “cash out” prizes or “winnings” for real money or tangible real-life prizes and that real-world money or other prizes could not be won. They said there were certain mechanics and features intended to make the game more engaging which often involved a virtual in-game currency which had no real-world value. They highlighted that, in order to play the game, consumers had to first download it from an app store where text stated the game did not offer real-world money gambling, and that wins made while gambling in social casino games could not be exchanged into real-world money or real rewards. The consumer then had to confirm they had read the terms of use which stated that in-game virtual items had no cash value and could not be exchanged for real-world money or for any real goods. They explained that, if either ad was clicked, it would take consumers to a web page where they could download the game. They believed that web page made clear that the app did not offer real-world money gambling or an opportunity to win tangible prizes. They said the name “Billionaire Casino” and the slot machine imagery and real-life slot machine sounds featured in the ads were typical of social casino apps. The aim of the app was to provide a casino experience without being able to win or stake real money or prizes. They also believed that those likely to download the app as a result of the ad would be familiar with the genre of social casino games and the style of such ads seen on TikTok. They said TikTok was predominantly used by a demographic who understood the way such apps were promoted, and that exaggeration and puffery were commonly seen in those ads, which they believed was permitted under the CAP Code. They referenced the text seen in ads (a) and (b) and said they appeared as animations in a cartoon style and referred to virtual prizes with no real currency used. They said they had not intended to imply the person in ad (a) had purchased a brand-new car as a result of playing the game, but rather that the person stopped going to the casino and with the money saved they could buy a car. They believed the tone of the ad was light-hearted and viewers would understand that those comments were an obvious exaggeration. They said the text, “it’s all the casino fun without the casino fuss” made it clear no money could be won. With regards to ad (b), they said the ad promoted an event within the game called “Luxury Villa”. The purpose of the ad was to promote new features of the game and the ad started with the animated phrase, “Huge Changes are Here” which was a reference to the updates to the game. The content, words and animations described the changes within the Luxury Villa event and appeared similarly in cartoon style, with no suggestion of winning real-world money or prizes. Huuuge Games confirmed that they had removed the ads from TikTok upon notification of the complaint. TikTok said restrictions applied to the advertising of social casino games on their platform and that included the prohibition of content implying that users could earn real-world money or where direct comparisons to gambling were made. They said the ads had breached TikTok ad policies and they confirmed that the ads had been withdrawn from the platform.","The ASA understood that social casino apps emulated slot machines or other casino-based games. However, we understood consumers were unable to win or withdraw any real-world money or tangible prizes from such apps, and therefore, they were not gambling products. We further understood that, whilst real-world money was not required to play, there were in-game purchase options available which enabled consumers to buy in-game currency or additional gameplay features. Ad (a) featured an individual who stated they were able to buy a brand-new car because they had stopped going to the casino and played Billionaire Casino instead. The scene was not cartoonish or animated; rather, the person was seen in the new car, a Tesla, which we considered consumers would understand to be a luxury car. Therefore, we considered consumers would interpret that to mean the individual had won a significant amount of money by playing Billionaire Casino and had been able to purchase the new car with the winnings they had accrued. The ad then showed game footage which emulated slot machine games and were also referred to as “slot games”, and used prize terminology such as, “HUUUGE JACKPOT”, “boost your jackpot chances” and “win massive prizes”. We considered such text, along with the slot machine footage, further implied that the individual had been able to purchase the car through winnings earned via the app and that real-world money or tangible prizes could be won by consumers. In addition, we noted the ad did not include any information that real-world money or prizes could not be won. Consequently, we considered that the ad contained various elements that, overall, gave the impression that real-world and tangible prizes could be won. We acknowledged that ad (b) was animated and was not in a realistic style. However, the ad replicated gameplay and featured short clips of a roulette-style wheel and a slot machine, which emulated real-world casino app games. Despite the animated style, because the imagery seen in the ad was reflective of other such casino-based apps in which real-world money could be won, we considered that consumers would understand that Billionaire Casino also offered players that opportunity. Furthermore, the ad referred to “BIGGER PRIZES!”, “IMPROVED REWARDS!”, “BIGGER TICKET & LOTTERY PRIZES!” and “HIGHER PRIZES ON BOTH WHEELS!”, which we considered strengthened the impression that consumers could win real-world money. Similarly, we noted that there was no information in the ad to indicate that the winnings or prizes could not be withdrawn. We understood that Billionaire Casino was a social casino app and that neither real-world money nor prizes could be won through gameplay. We acknowledged the advertiser’s argument that the ads did not feature or refer to real-world currency, and their belief that it was therefore clear to consumers that real-world money could not be won. However, we considered the lack of any such references was not sufficient to dispel the overriding impression that real-world money or tangible prizes could be won by playing Billionaire Casino. We also acknowledged that the ads featured a linked to a web page which stated that the games did not offer the opportunity to win or withdraw real-world money or tangible prizes. However, we noted that information appeared in small text within the web page and, in any case, we considered that the ads themselves did not include information which made that clear to consumers. The decision to click through to the app from the ad was a transactional decision in relation to downloading the game, and we considered that consumers were not provided with information that was material to that decision. Because we considered the claims and imagery featured in the ads, alongside the name of the app, “Billionaire Casino”, gave the impression that the app was a gambling product in which real-world money or tangible prizes could be won and withdrawn, we concluded that the ads were misleading and breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).",The ads must not appear again in their current form.

ASA Ruling on Mazda Motors UK Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on electric vehicle advertising and environmental claims. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Meta ad for Mazda seen on 31 May 2024 featured an image of the Mazda2 Hybrid car, text stated “The Mazda2 Hybrid combines the power of a petrol engine and the efficiency of a battery-powered electric motor. Exciting, efficient and sustainable”.",The ASA challenged whether the claim “sustainable” gave a misleading impression of the car’s environmental impact and could be substantiated.,"Mazda Motors UK Ltd said they accepted the ad could unintentionally give a misleading impression, that they withdrew it when they were made aware of it, and they undertook a full review to ensure they were not using the claim elsewhere. They said the use of “sustainable” was intended to communicate the efficiency of the Mazda2 Hybrid in comparison to the non-hybrid Mazda2 model. They said the basis of the claim centred on the use of the Mazda2 Hybrid’s combined battery-powered electric motor and petrol engine, with the battery powered electric motor offering competitive fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.","The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear, and that absolute environmental claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Environmental claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. The ASA welcomed Mazda’s willingness to withdraw the ad and make changes to their campaigns in light of receiving notification of the investigation.The ad featured the claim “The Mazda2 Hybrid combines the power of a petrol engine and the efficiency of a battery-powered electric motor. Exciting, efficient and sustainable”. We acknowledged that Mazda sold a version of the Mazda2 with a petrol engine and without an electric battery engine, and that the electric battery of the Mazda Hybrid would result in lower carbon emissions, when driving, in comparison to the petrol version of the Mazda2. However, that comparison was not referenced. We considered “sustainable” was an absolute claim, and in the context of the ad, was likely to be understood by consumers as referring to the full life cycle of the hybrid Mazda2. We understood that when the Mazda2 Hybrid’s electric battery engine was used no emissions were produced from the tailpipe, but when the car used its petrol engine, greenhouse gases were produced. We also understood other circumstances, such as the manufacturing of the car and charging the battery using electricity from the national grid, generated emissions. Evidence in relation to the entire life cycle of the car, which would include the use of a petrol engine, had not been produced. The absolute claim “sustainable” had therefore not been adequately substantiated.Because the basis of the claim had not been made clear, and we had not seen evidence based on the full life cycle of the car to support the absolute claim “sustainable” as it would be understood by consumers, we concluded the ad had misleadingly minimised the impact of the Mazda2 Hybrid. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 (Environmental claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We reminded Mazda Motors UK Ltd to ensure the basis of future environmental claims was made clear and did not give a misleading impression of a vehicle’s environmental impact, and that robust substantiation was held to support absolute claims.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/mazda-motors-uk-ltd-a24-1247950-mazda-motors-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Mobee Co Ltd t/a Ignite Classic Slots,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on paid-for gambling-like ads, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 25 September 2024.","Two paid-for TikTok ads for “Ignite Classic Slots”, a social casino game app, seen in March 2024: a. The first ad featured an individual in front of a slot machine holding a large amount of money, as they said, “I have over 200 grand in my bank account because I stopped going to casinos and started playing this mobile slots game where I haven’t spent any money; however, I can still win super big. It’s called Ignite Classic Slots […] I play for tons of reasons. First it’s free, and it’s free to play, second it has super, high odds of winning jackpots, plus its designed by real casino experts […] And if you want to download from this video right now you’ll get 12 million coins in a welcome bonus so tap here and play for free today.” On-screen gameplay imagery accompanied the on-screen text and included slot machine and spinning wheels, as well as text that stated “BIG WINS” and “SUPER WIN”. b. The second ad opened with a slot machine being played by an off-screen individual who said, “Lets go, winner […] be a miracle […] ” before the shot cut to a different individual in front of another slot machine who said, “Casinos are taking a gamble that you will take a gamble and lose all your money. Why not save that money and spend it on a much better thing? Download Ignite Classic Slots. Download from this video and you get 3 million free coins just for signing up.” At the same time a mobile phone notification appeared at the top and displayed text that stated “You just received [coin emoji] 3000000 coins”. The individual then continued, “When you play it’s a 100% hit rate […] even at level 1 you can play over 300 slot machines for free more than all machines in this casino combined […] it’s free to play, it’s free to download, and you get that big bonus right now.” At the same time, a carousel of slot machines was shown at the top of the video.",The ASA challenged whether the ads misleadingly implied the social casino game was a gambling product in which real-world money or tangible prizes could be won and withdrawn.,"Mobee Co. Ltd did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. TikTok said restrictions applied to the advertising of social casino games on their platform and that included the prohibition of content implying that users could earn real-world money or where direct comparisons to gambling were made. They said the ads had breached TikTok ad policies, and as such, they had removed the ads from their platform.","The ASA was concerned by Mobee Co. Ltd’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. The ASA understood that social casino apps emulated slot machines or other casino-based games. However, we understood consumers were unable to win or withdraw any real-world money or tangible prizes from such apps, and therefore, they were not gambling products. We further understood that, whilst real-world money was not required to play, there were in-game purchase options available which enabled consumers to buy in-game currency or additional gameplay features. Ad (a) featured an individual who said that, as a result of playing the Ignite Classic Slots app instead of gambling at casinos, they had over £200,000 in their bank account”. We noted that the scene was realistic; the individual was seen holding a substantial amount of real-world money and they appeared to be in a casino, sitting directly in front of a slot machine. Because of that, we considered consumers would interpret that to mean the individual featured had won a significant amount of real-world money via the app, despite not having spent any real money. Furthermore, in the context of the imagery of an individual holding a large amount of money, we considered that “win a lot” would be interpreted as winning a lot of real money. Later on in the ad, gameplay footage from Ignite Classic Slots appeared on screen, as the individual continued to speak. The featured gameplay emulated casino-based gambling such as slot machines and a roulette wheel, and we considered that consumers, seeing the gameplay footage alongside the individual situated in a casino and adjacent to a slot machine, would understand that Ignite Classic Slots was similar to traditional casino-based gambling and that it would be possible to win real-world money or other tangible prizes. We considered that impression was further reinforced by the description that the game was “designed by real casino experts” and that consumers would infer the app offered a similar casino experience. In addition, the ad contained numerous references to winning and odds, for example, “super-high odds” and “jackpot”. We considered such terminology was commonly associated with gambling and the chances of winning real-world money or prizes. Their inclusion in the ad contributed to the impression that consumers could gamble, win and withdraw real-world money through the Ignite Classic Slots app. Ad (b) featured an individual playing a slot machine in a casino who quickly becomes frustrated with losing their bet, juxtaposed with a different individual, also seen in a casino, who discussed the risk of losing one’s stake at a casino. Instead, the individual suggested that consumers should save the money they would have otherwise spent in a casino and use it to download the Ignite Classic Slots app. Because the ad contrasted losing within a casino environment and implied that it would be more beneficial to spend that money on the app, we considered consumers would interpret that to mean the experience of playing the game was analogous to gambling in a traditional casino, but unlike physical casinos, an individual’s chances of winning real-world money were higher when playing Ignite Classic Slots. That impression was reinforced by the statement that the app contained over 300 slot machines, which the second individual in the ad stated was, “more than all machines in this casino combined”. We considered that would be interpreted by consumers to mean the app provided an enhanced experience to playing traditional casino slot machines and, within the context of those comments, that individuals were likely to lose money at a casino and the probability of winning on the app was greater. We considered the slot gameplay footage, along with repeated references to “coins”, which were commonly associated with slot machines, and the phrases “big bonus” and “100% hit rate” further strengthened the impression that the app offered an enhanced experience of playing slot machines in a casino where real money would be won. However, we understood that Ignite Classic Slots was a social casino game, and users could neither win nor cash-out real-world money. We acknowledged that the function of the app was to emulate the experience of playing a slot machine or other casino-based games. However, we considered that consumers would interpret the ads to mean that, because the app was comparable to a real-life casino experience, consumers would be able to gamble as they would in a casino and win large amounts of real-world money. Because we considered the claims and imagery featured in the ads gave the impression that the apps were gambling products in which real-world money or tangible prizes could be won and withdrawn, we concluded that the ads were misleading and had breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading Advertising).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Mobee Co Ltd to ensure they did not imply consumers could win real-world money or tangible prizes. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/mobee-co-ltd-a24-1241357-mobee-co-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Moreham Wood Ltd t/a Oak Furniture Superstore,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A website for Oak Furniture Superstore, www.oakfurnituresuperstore.co.uk, seen on 15 April 2024. A banner at the top of the home page featured text which stated “SPRING SAVINGS EVENT LAST CHANCE Hurry! Ends in 0 Days 05 Hours 08 Minutes 21 Seconds”. In a search box, text stated “herringbone” and underneath were displayed the search results showing images of various furniture products accompanied by text showing “Was” prices compared to “Now” prices. Text stated “Herringbone Solid Oak Super King Bed Now £699 Was £999 [crossed out] Save £300”.","The complainant challenged whether the: 1. use of the countdown clock misleadingly implied that the sales promotion was time limited, because the same promotion was still available under a new name shortly after the countdown ended; and 2. savings claims were misleading and could be substantiated.","1. Moreham Wood Ltd t/a Oak Furniture Superstore said the countdown clock on their website clearly indicated to customers that the promotion was ending on the advertised date. The ad showed the results from searching “herringbone” in the websites’ search bar. These products were not included in the “SPRING SAVINGS EVENT”. A product search on the website would return any product available for sale and not specifically products in a current promotion. Products that were available as part of the promotion, were clearly advertised on the Flash Savings promotional page. That promotional page was accessible by clicking on the Spring Savings Event banner which was next to the countdown clock. The Flash Savings promotion entitled customers purchasing any product included within the promotion to an extra five per cent off the sale price with a unique promotional discount code. The discount code was again clearly advertised on the Flash Savings promotional page. The discount code expired in line with the promotion end date. A new Price Drop promotion began on 18 April and ran until 19 April. The Price Drop promotion entitled customers purchasing the products included within the promotion to an extra five per cent off the sale price with a unique promotional discount code. The promotional code expired in line with the promotion end date. Different products were on promotion as part of the Price Drop event, so the same products were not eligible for a promotional saving across the Flash Savings promotion and the Price Drop promotion. To avoid customer confusion and ensure a clear separation of promotions, they used a unique colour pallet for each promotion. The colour change was also replicated in the banner that housed the countdown clock. 2. The example in the ad highlighted the Herringbone King Size Bed. The Herringbone range was a new range first launched in December 2023 at which point the King Size Bed retailed at its higher price until the 23 December 2023 when it moved to a sale price of £699. The range was launched later than planned and was not retailing at the higher price for the full introductory period initially intended. Upon inspection, following notification of the complaint, it appeared that a rotation of Herringbone range pricing. Moving prices back to the original higher price was overlooked due to their highly manual processes. With the issue now highlighted, it allowed them to review the supporting processes and they confirmed that the Herringbone range was currently selling at a higher price than in December 2023. The review enabled them to tighten up and add additional processes and checks whilst they awaited the roll out of their new IT system. They said they were actively implementing additional measures to ensure that the communication of which products were on promotion at any given time was both accurate and transparent. They provided a unit count of sales for the Herringbone range from December 2023 to June 2024. They said that due to current system limitations, they were unable to easily and accurately break down historical sales data.","The ad featured the home page with a banner along the top which stated “SPRING SAVINGS EVENT LAST CHANCE” along with boxes displaying Days, Hours, Minutes and Seconds, that appeared to be counting down to zero. In the search box below, was the search term “herringbone” and underneath a box with a preview of the results listings for products in the Herringbone range, was shown with “was” prices crossed out and “now” prices in red writing. The ASA understood that further down the home page other discounted products were displayed with “was” and “now” prices. We considered that consumers would understand that Oak Furniture Superstore was running a promotion which was ending soon, and that the displayed discounted products were included in the promotion. Once the countdown clock reached zero those products would return to their usual selling price. We considered the phrase “Hurry! Ends in” reinforced the impression that the promotion was time-limited. However, we understood that the products in the Herringbone range as well as the products shown further down the home page were not included in the Spring Savings Event promotion. The promotion only applied to a small, selected number of products and to see those products consumers had to click on the banner at the top of the home page to be taken to a new webpage. On that subsequent page, it stated that consumers would receive an additional five percent discount off the sale price using a discount code. We considered it was not clear to consumers from the home page that the promotion was only on selected items, and to access those items they had to click on the banner to see the products included in the promotion, or that the promotion was for an extra five per cent off sale prices on selected products. We considered that was material information that consumers required to make an informed decision about the promotion. Furthermore, in the absence of that information, we considered consumers would expect that all items that were discounted on the website were included in the Spring Savings Event and therefore their prices would revert to a higher price once the countdown clock ended. We therefore considered that was likely to pressurise consumers into making a swift transactional decision.However, we understood that after the Spring Savings Event ended, another promotion started immediately afterwards with a new countdown clock. It operated in a similar way, whereby only a selection of products were included, but the nature of the promotion or how to access the promotional products was not made clear for the same reasons as referenced above. Because the ad did not make clear that only selected products were included in the promotion and implied that all the products on sale were in a time-limited promotion which would revert to the usual price when the countdown ended, when that was not the case, we concluded the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading Advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.17 (Prices) and 8.17.4.e (Promotional marketing). The search results featured products in the Herringbone range, including the Herringbone Solid Oak Super King Bed, which all displayed “was” prices and “now” prices written in red, along with the amount consumers would save. We understood the Herringbone range launched in early December 2023. The super king bed retailed at its higher price of £999 until 23rd December 2023, when it was reduced to £699 in the sale. We considered consumers would understand the lower price to represent a genuine saving against the usual selling price for the product and that the price had been reduced for a temporary promotional period. However, we understood the bed was not sold at its higher price for the full period initially intended and that after its price was reduced in December, the bed was not restored to its higher selling price after that sale period until June 2024. Although the Herringbone Super King bed was not included in the Spring Savings Event and therefore the sale price was not time-limited in the way the countdown clock suggested, we nonetheless expected the “was” price to represent the usual selling price. Selling the product at its higher price from the beginning of December 2023 until 23 December 2023 and then for several months at the reduced price meant that the product was offered at the lower promotional price for much longer than the higher non-promotional price. We therefore considered that the promotional price was in effect the usual selling price of the product. Additionally, Oak Furniture Superstore provided data on the number of units sold in the Herringbone range each month between December 2023 and June 2024. But we had not been given any pricing history for any products in the Herringbone range and we understood that Oak Furniture Superstore were limited in the data they were able to provide.Because we considered that the promotional products were not usually sold at a higher non-promotional price, we concluded that the savings claims were likely to mislead consumers. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (Prices).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Moreham Wood Ltd t/a Oak Furniture Superstore to ensure that their future ads made the basis of their promotions clear, including where the promotion applied only to selected items and how to access the included products. We also told them to ensure that future savings claims did not mislead and that they substantiated savings claims against the usual selling prices of their products.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/moreham-wood-ltd-a24-1237514-moreham-wood-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Nike Retail BV,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on online choice architecture, identified for investigation following complaints received and intelligence gathered by the ASA.","A paid-for ad on X for The Sole Supplier, seen in December 2023, featured an image of a pair of Nike trainers. The captioned stated, “Now just £26 at Nike! [exploding head emoji] [black heart emoji]”. The ad clicked through to a product listing on the Nike website.","The ASA, who understood the product was intended for older children and limited to sizes UK 3?6, challenged whether the ad was misleading.","Nike Retail B.V. t/a Nike confirmed that they had a commercial relationship with The Sole Supplier Ltd, whereby The Sole Supplier would receive commission for sales generated through their ads. They explained that the contractual agreement allowed The Sole Supplier to advertise Nike and its products without prior approval. The Sole Supplier, however, was required to ensure that ads complied with applicable laws and regulations, including the CAP Code. Nike therefore confirmed that the ad was created and published by The Sole Supplier without any input or oversight from them. They believed that because commission was based on sales, rather than the amount of clicks the ad received, the risk that affiliate marketers would publish misleading ads to entice clicks from consumers was mitigated. Nike did not believe that the ad was misleading. Given the promotional price and the caption of the ad, they believed a reasonable consumer would assume that there would be some limitation on the item, such as the availability of sizes. Furthermore, they believed the lack of complaints supported the view that consumers did not find the ad misleading. The Sole Supplier said the ad guided users to more detailed information about the product, including what sizes were available. However, they said they were amenable to considering how to present size information more prominently in future advertising, within the constraints of the platform.","The CAP Code required that marketing communications did not mislead consumers by hiding material information or presenting it in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner. The ASA noted the brief caption, which included the price and brand of the product, and the simplicity of the image, which showed the trainers against a white background. We noted there was nothing in the ad to indicate to consumers that the trainers were intended for older children or that they were available in limited adult sizing, nor were there any visual cues, such as a sense of scale, to indicate the smaller size of the shoes. We therefore considered that consumers would rely on their own assumptions when interpreting the ad and, in the absence of any information to suggest otherwise, we considered most consumers would reasonably assume that the trainers were for adults. Furthermore, we considered the text “Now just £26” alongside the exploding head emoji reinforced the impression that the pictured trainers were intended for adults. We considered the text and emoji implied that the advertised price was a significant discount against the usual selling price of the trainers. Because children’s shoes were typically cheaper than adult shoes, and were exempt from VAT, we considered that the average consumer would not regard £26 as a heavily discounted price for children’s trainers, and therefore would understand the price referred to a pair of adult trainers. We therefore considered that the consumer would click through to the website and expect to be able to purchase a pair of adult trainers at the advertised price. We understood that the ad linked to the product page for the ‘Nike MD Valiant’ trainers on the Nike website. The page categorised the trainers as an “Older Kids’ Shoe” with available sizes ranging from UK 3 to UK 6. We understood that the majority of adult women’s Nike lifestyle trainers were available up to size 9.5, with some styles available up to size 14, and adult men’s Nike lifestyle trainers were available up to size 14. On that basis, we considered that the sizes of the advertised product were limited to such an extent that a significant number of adults would not be able to purchase their desired size. While we acknowledged that the linked page contained clear information about the available sizes, we considered that the ad implied that the shoes were for adults, and that consumers who clicked through from the ad would be doing so on that understanding. Because the ad did not make clear that the advertised trainers were older children’s shoes or limited in adult sizing, we concluded that the ad was likely to be misleading by omission. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).","The ad should not appear again in the form complained of. We told Nike Retail B.V. t/a Nike and The Sole Supplier Ltd to ensure that in future, their ads did not omit material information, such as limitations on sizing, which would cause consumers to make a transactional decision they would not have otherwise taken.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/nike-retail-bv-a24-1229829-nike-retail-bv.html
ASA Ruling on Not Guilty Food Co Ltd t/a The Skinny Food Co,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A Facebook post by The Skinny Food Co, seen on 15 April 2024, showed images of two glass mugs of coffee. The mugs and the contents appeared to be identical apart from a pixelated Starbucks logo on one and The Skinny Food Co’s logo on the other. Text above the Starbucks coffee stated “380 Calories Per Serving”. Text above The Skinny Food Co’s mug stated “11 Calories Per Serving”. Text elsewhere in the post stated “Upgrade your morning coffee! Try a low calorie swap with the Skinny Food Co” and “Low Calorie, Coffee Swaps”.","The complainant challenged whether the following claims were in breach of the Code: 1. the claim “Low calorie”, in relation to The Skinny Food Co’s coffee products; and 2. the calorie content comparison between The Skinny Food Co’s product and the competitor’s product.","1. Not Guilty Food Co Ltd t/a The Skinny Food Co supplied information which they believed showed that each of the products referred to in the ad met the conditions of use set out in the Great Britain Nutrition and Health Claims Register (the GB NHC Register) for the “low energy” nutrition claim. They said the coffee made from their products had 11 calories in it. It was comprised of: a 3 g serving of coffee granules, which contained 10 kcal; a 10 ml serving of creamer which contained 1 kcal; and a 10 ml serving of salted caramel syrup and a 10 ml serving of Barista Syrup, both of which contained zero calories. 2. The Skinny Food Co did not reply to this point.","Only nutrition claims authorised on the GB NHC Register could be made in ads promoting food or drink products. The CAP Code defined a nutrition claim as any claim which stated, suggested or implied that a food (or drink) had particular beneficial nutritional properties due to the amount of calories, nutrients or other substances it contained, did not contain, or contained in reduced or increased proportions. In addition, the advertiser must ensure that the product met the conditions of use associated with the authorised claim. We considered, given the context of the ad, that consumers would interpret the “low calorie” claim to mean that the Skinny Food Co mug of coffee shown and all other products referred to, were low calorie. The GB NHC Register allowed a “low energy” claim, which we considered equivalent to the “low calorie” claim made in the ad, to be made only where a product did not contain more than 40 kcal per 100 g for solids or more than 20 kcal per 100 ml for liquids. For table-top sweeteners the limit of 4 kcal per portion, with equivalent sweetening properties to 6 g of sucrose (approximately one teaspoon of sucrose) applied. We therefore expected to see evidence that the coffee shown, and all the products referred to, met those conditions of use. The glass of coffee shown in the ad appeared to be a frappuccino, with whipped cream on the top and caramel syrup drizzled on the cream. We considered the cup of coffee which The Skinny Food Co described as coming to 11 kcal was unlikely to be the same as the one shown in the ad. The coffee shown in the ad had a thick layer of whipped cream on top as well as the coffee itself being milky, which we considered was unlikely to be obtained from a 10 ml serving of creamer. We considered The Skinny Food Co had therefore not provided evidence that the coffee shown in the ad met the conditions of use for a ""low energy"" nutrition claim, and we concluded the claim therefore breached the Code. Additionally, the ad's caption stated ""Try a low calorie swap with the Skinny Food Co"" and ""Low Calorie Coffee Swaps - Hundreds of coffee syrups, creamers & flavour shots to choose from"". We considered consumers would understand that to mean that all the products were ""low calorie"". The Skinny Food Co therefore needed to provide us with information which showed all those products met the conditions of use for a ""low calorie"" nutrition claim. However, they had only supplied nutritional information for the creamer, salted caramel syrup and Barista Syrup. Because we had not seen evidence that all the products referenced in the ad met the condition of use for a ""low calorie"" nutrition claim, we concluded those claims also breached the Code. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The ad featured two identical looking coffees from two different brands with the calorie comparison between them highlighted – the Skinny Food Co coffee was shown as having a much lower calorie content. We considered that was equivalent to the ""reduced energy"" comparative nutrition claim on the GB NHC Register. Comparative nutrition claims must meet the conditions of use associated with the permitted claim and must compare the difference in the claimed nutrient to a range of foods in the same category. A comparison with a single product, however, was permitted as long as that product was representative of products in its category. The difference in the quantity of a nutrient or energy value must be stated in the marketing communication and must relate to the same quantity of food. The advertiser had not provided complete information about the calorific content of their coffee as shown in the ad. They also had not provided any information about the nutritional content of the comparator product or similar products from other coffee shops to show that the comparator product was representative of products in the category. Without that information, we considered The Skinny Food Co had not shown that the stated calorific content of the comparator product was accurate, that the claim met the conditions of use for a ""reduced energy"" comparative nutrition claim, that they had compared products in the same food category or that the competitor product they had used for the comparison did not have a composition which allowed it to bear a nutrition claim. We therefore concluded that the calorie content comparison claim breached the Code. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.3, 15.3.1 and 15.3.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Not Guilty Food Co Ltd t/a The Skinny Food Co to ensure that when making nutrition and comparative nutrition claims they held evidence to show that the relevant products met the conditions of use for the claim. We also told them to ensure that they held evidence to show that comparative nutrition claims compared products in the same food category, that the comparator product was representative of products in the category, and that the comparator product did not have a composition which allowed it to bear a nutrition claim.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/not-guilty-food-co-ltd-a24-1242030-not-guilty-food-co-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Reiss Ltd,,"An Instagram reel on Lydia Millen’s account @lydiamillen, posted on 8 April 2024, featured Ms Millen trying on different clothing items to prepare for a flight. In the video, she stated, “So, you know my ivory jeans that I’ve not been able to take off for the past two weeks? Well, they come in green too” while holding up the jeans at the camera, with the REISS label visible. Ms Millen then followed, “And you know, when I found a silk Theory top to match the jeans, I literally lost it […]”. The caption stated “One for the Evergreen girlies [plant emoji]”. At the time the reel was posted, Ms Millen also shared two Instagram stories containing affiliate rStyle.me links to the product pages of the Reiss and Theory items featured in the reel.","The complainant, who understood that the reel was posted together with Instagram stories containing affiliate links to the items featured in the video, challenged whether the reel was identifiable as a marketing communication.","Reiss Ltd t/a Reiss stated that Ms Millen was not an influencer they directly worked with. They used Partnerize as their affiliate partner, which could mean that Ms Millen had used an affiliate link through Partnerize for the stories that accompanied the reel. Partnerize was a technology provider to Reiss, that facilitated transaction tracking for Reiss’ online advertising. They stated that they did not have visibility of which influencers were linking to their products through Partnerize, and therefore driving traffic or sales to them, as they did not directly work with those influencers. They said that when they did work with influencers directly, they had a team that ensured the influencers tagged their content appropriately, as outlined in their contracts with them. Link Theory (UK) Ltd t/a Theory said that the reel was organic content uploaded by Ms Millen, without being paid for or managed by Theory. They had previously worked with Ms Millen in May 2022, with a contract in place which required her to disclose that content was advertising. They also confirmed that they gifted Ms Millen three items in April and May 2024. The items featured in the reel were not gifted to her, and they were not involved in the making of the reel. Ms Millen said that she had bought the Reiss and Theory items shown in the reel and provided receipts for the purchases. She stated that at the time the reel was posted, there were no commercial relationships in place with either brand. She confirmed that she had worked with both brands previously, with her collaboration with Reiss having taken place in June 2023. Regarding the stories that contained affiliate links for the items shown in the reels, she noted that they did include an ad identifier. While there were no mentions or hashtags referring to either brand on the reel, she had included tags for all brands featured in the reel, to help her audience identify the brands and pre-empt queries. rewardStyle Inc t/a LTK, the technology partner hosting the affiliate links, said that they provided technology to influencers to create shoppable social media posts that could track sales for brands. They took a number of steps designed to ensure ads that used affiliate rStyle.me links were obviously identifiable as such. They required creators to agree by contract to include ad disclosures in their social media posts. They further provided creators with educational resources, including detailed guidelines and instructions for engaging with marketing campaigns on their platform. Regarding the reel in question, they believed the reel was promotional content for Ms Millen’s newly released book “Evergreen”. They stated that several comments under the reel sought information on the brand names of the items mentioned in the reel, but Ms Millen did not appear to have responded to these comments, nor had she included rStyle.me (affiliate) links on the reel. In contrast, the stories that did include rStyle.me links were labelled with “Ad”. They believed Ms Millen had treated the reel as a separate piece of content from the stories. In their view, it did not appear that the reel was intended to be an ad, or that Ms Millen was compensated for that content. Performance Horizon Group Ltd t/a Partnerize said that they provided a tracking solution for Reiss’ performance marketing, which enabled payments to be made to the appropriate partner in accordance with the terms of Reiss’ campaigns. They said that the campaigns themselves were not created or managed by Partnerize; they were not involved with the content or placement of ads, nor with the choice of which influencers were involved. It was their understanding that brands worked with third parties who recruited and managed influencers.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and that they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. In cases of affiliate marketing, both the brand and the affiliate marketer were responsible under the Code, notwithstanding the fact that the ads may have been created solely by the affiliate without any input from the business themselves. The ASA first assessed whether the Instagram reel was an ad for the purposes of the Code. It was posted at the same time as two Instagram stories which contained affiliate links to the items featured in the reel. We acknowledged that Ms Millen had purchased the featured items herself, and the brands Reiss and Theory had not provided payment for the reel or the stories. Instead, the affiliate links in the stories would earn Ms Millen commission when purchases were made through them and were therefore marketing communications. We considered the stories were clearly and prominently labelled as ads. The reel was posted on the same day as the story ads, featured the same items for which there were affiliate links in the stories, and had the same cover photo as the stories. For those reasons, we considered that all three posts were connected to Ms Millen’s affiliate relationships with Reiss and Theory. We therefore concluded that the reel was a marketing communication. We then assessed whether the ad was obviously identifiable as such. The brands Reiss and Theory were tagged in the reel. However, there was no indication in the caption, or within the video, that alerted consumers that the reel was a marketing communication. In the absence of any clear identifiers, we concluded that the reel was not obviously identifiable as an ad and did not make clear its commercial intent. We therefore concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 (Recognition of marketing communications).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Reiss Ltd, Link Theory (UK) Ltd and Lydia Millen to ensure that their ads were obviously identifiable as such, for example by including a clear and prominent identifier such as “ad”.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/reiss-ltd-a24-1241344-reiss-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Shop TJC Ltd t/a The Jewellery Channel,,"A teleshopping presentation for a blue and red light therapy electric toothbrush, seen on The Jewellery Channel on 10 April 2024. During the presentation, a TJC presenter made a number of claims regarding the effects of using the product. He stated, ""It will remove staining, it will kill bacteria … if you’ve got gingivitis [...] this is sanitising [...] The benefits of red light therapy […] it would regerminate, regenerate, heal, grow […] picked up by medical professional for burns and for healing […] Now they’ve proven that light therapy actually can transform the human body in many ways […] Red light therapy is medically, clinically, and scientifically proven that it will stimulate. Now, if you’ve got receding gums ... dentists will tell you they can’t be repaired, damage is done. But red light therapy is clinically, medically, and scientifically proven that it will work on cell regeneration, regrowth, reperforming .... maybe you’ve got other [sic] form of dental decay [...] it will kill bacteria, it will help regrowth, it will help stimulate fresh blood […] if you’ve got receding gums, gingivitis, any decay that is in around your mouth [...] we know that red light therapy has the ability to increase blood flow, to work on cell regeneration, to work on renewal of collagen, fibroblast […] so now for the first time in history, we now have a toothbrush that physically has the capabilities to rebuild your mouth [...] Blue light therapy for bacterial reduction, teeth whitening, gum health […] Red light therapy, for tissue healing, increased circulation, reduced inflammation.”",The complainant challenged whether the medical claims breached the Code.,"Shop TJC Ltd t/a TJC said many of their products were supplied by third-party partners and, therefore, they usually relied on information received from those suppliers when making product claims. At the time of responding, they were working to ascertain whether the claims in the ad had been based on information provided by the product supplier. However, they had established that the product supplier had not conducted clinical or medical studies on the product, although they had examined a number of studies assessing the effects of light therapy specifically in relation to bacteria, which TJC believed were the source of mouth and dental problems that had been referred to in their presentation. They said the presenter qualified their comments by highlighting that they were neither a dentist nor were they able to give dental or medical advice. They also supplied the studies that had been provided by the manufacturer.In response to the complaint, they alerted the presenter, suspended promotion of the product pending the outcome of the investigation and said that the claims would not be repeated in future.","The Medical Devices Regulation (2002) required that a medical device should be registered with the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) before it was placed on the market in Great Britain. The ASA understood that the product was not registered with the MHRA as a medical device. The BCAP Code stated that teleshopping presentations for medical treatments for humans or animals were not acceptable. We considered consumers would understand, “it will kill bacteria … if you’ve got gingivitis [...] this is sanitising”, “if you’ve got receding gums, gingivitis, any decay that is in around your mouth [...] we know that red light therapy has the ability to increase blood flow, to work on cell regeneration, to work on renewal of collagen, fibroblast […]” as well as “if you’ve got receding gums ... dentists will tell you they can’t be repaired, damage is done […] it will work on cell regeneration, regrowth, reperforming” as claims that the toothbrush could be used to treat periodontal disease, which included gingivitis and receding gums. We further considered that consumers would understand “maybe you’ve got other [sic] form of dental decay [...] it will kill bacteria, it will help regrowth, it will help stimulate fresh blood” to mean that the product was able to treat dental decay. In addition, we considered the claims “Blue light therapy for bacterial reduction, teeth whitening, gum health […]” and “Red light therapy, for tissue healing, increased circulation, reduced inflammation” reinforced the impression that the product could prevent dental decay. Therefore, we considered that within the context of the ad as a whole, viewers were likely to understand the above claims made in the presentation to mean that the product could be used to treat and alleviate various oral health conditions, and considered the ad breached the Code on that basis. In addition, the Code required that medicinal or medical claims and indications were made only for a medicinal product that was licensed by the MHRA, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. We considered that the claims, as set out above, were medical claims and therefore required that the product met the requirements for medical devices. However, as above, we understood the product was not registered with the MHRA, nor had we seen any evidence to demonstrate the product was a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. Notwithstanding that the ad breached the Code by being a teleshopping presentation for medical treatments for humans, we considered no medical claims could be made for the product, and the ad also breached the Code on that basis. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 1.3 (Compliance), 11.4, 11.12 and 11.12.3 (Medical devices).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Shop TJC Ltd t/a TJC to ensure teleshopping ads did not promote products or services that were medical treatments for humans, and not to make medical claims for products that did not have the applicable conformity marking and were not licensed by the MHRA.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/shop-tjc-ltd-a24-1241519-shop-tjc-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Sky UK Ltd t/a NOW,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on online choice architecture, identified for investigation following complaints received and intelligence gathered by the ASA.","A website for NOW TV, www.nowtv.com, a subscription streaming service, seen in December 2023, showed the different membership options for purchasing an entertainment subscription. The membership selection page featured the sub-heading “ENTERTAINMENT MEMBERSHIP” and a clickable button labelled “Choose your membership”. Upon clicking that button, consumers were taken to a page showing two subscription options labelled “6 Month Saver” and “Fully Flexible”. Text in a bullet list in the “6 Month Saver” subscription stated “Watch in Full HD on 3 devices at once with 1 month free Boost”. Small text stated “New Boost members only. After your 1 month free trial Boost auto-renews at £6 a month unless cancelled”. Text in the “Fully Flexible” subscription stated “Included: 7 day free trial of Cinema and Boost – cancel anytime”. Small text stated “After your 7 day free trials, membership auto-renew monthly at £9.99 for Cinema and £6 for Boost. Cancel anytime”.","The ASA, who understood that free trials were automatically added to the basket and would auto-renew at a monthly charge unless cancelled, challenged whether the presentation of the options was misleading.","Sky UK Ltd t/a NOW believed that the presentation of the ad was clear to consumers. They detailed that when a consumer landed on the membership selection page they were presented with the available memberships, such as ‘Entertainment’ or ‘Cinema’. They highlighted that consumers were invited to select their preferred membership with the button “Choose your membership”. As such, they believed that the average consumer would understand that there was an element of choice because of the word “choose”, and that they would subsequently be presented with further options. They re-iterated that the average consumer would know that their selection at that point in time was not final. They said that when a consumer proceeded to the next page, they were presented with all available options for the Entertainment membership, namely the “Entertainment and Cinema 6 Month Saver” and the “Entertainment Fully Flexible” membership. They explained it was at that stage in the customer journey, that the consumer was first made aware of all the entertainment membership options available to them and that the “Entertainment Fully Flexible” membership came with a 7-day free trial of “Cinema” and “Boost”. They believed that the concept of a 7-day free trial was widely understood and, therefore, the inclusion of the free trials was not misleading. They also stated that the webpage prominently included all significant conditions relevant to the 7-day free trials. They re-iterated that information was clear, legible and immediately visible. Therefore, a consumer who selected the membership option would be fully informed that they were also adding the Cinema and Boost free trials to their basket and that they would auto-renew for a fee after the free trials ended. As such, they believed a consumer could not have been misled at the point they added the membership to their basket, because by continuing in the consumer journey, they believed that a consumer indicated their intention to proceed on the basis of receiving the free trials. They believed that the presentation of the options was sufficiently clear and was not likely to mislead consumers into making a transactional decision they would not have otherwise made. NOW also said that, as result of receiving notification of the complaint, they would be carrying out user experience testing on their online customer journeys, specifically in relation to the concerns raised by the complainant. They intended to use those results to make improvements to the customer experience. They also provided several examples of amended text within the ad in response to the complaint.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications referring to promotions must communicate all significant conditions where the omission of such conditions is likely to mislead. CAP guidance on ‘The advertising of free trials or other promotional offer subscription models’ stated that ads must make clear whether a paid subscription started automatically after the trial unless cancelled, and the extent of any financial commitment if the subscription was not cancelled during the trial. The guidance further stated such information must: be immediately visible and prominent; immediately follow the most prominent references to the trial or offer; and be clear and legible both in size and clarity of font. The “Choose your membership” webpage contained two boxes outlining the respective benefits of the “Entertainment” and “Cinema” membership; however, the ASA noted that text did not refer to the inclusion of the free trials. We therefore considered consumers would proceed with selecting their preferred membership, “Cinema” or “Entertainment”, and would be unaware of any free trials that might be included as part of the packages. Consumers who chose “Entertainment” were taken to a second webpage which detailed two different subscription options “Entertainment & Cinema” and “Entertainment” and the terms and benefits of each. Text within the box detailing the “Entertainment & Cinema” package stated “Watch in Full HD on 3 devices at once with 1 month free Boost” and text within the box for the “Entertainment” subscription stated that it “included: 7 day free trial of Cinema and Boost – cancel anytime”. We therefore considered, at that stage of the consumer journey, consumers would understand that the Entertainment package contained free trials. However, we considered that it was not clear from the text “1 month free Boost” that the Entertainment and Cinema package was even a trial or what features it included. We also noted that, whilst the text stated the length of the free trials, it did not make clear whether a subscription would start automatically after the trial period ended, and if so, the extent of the financial commitment if they were not cancelled in the trial period. Furthermore, we considered that the text “cancel anytime”, which was stated in relation to the 7-day free trial of Cinema and Boost, would be interpreted, in the absence of further prominent information, to mean that the trial could be cancelled if the consumer wanted, but that in any case they would not be subject to any obligations thereafter. However, we understood that each free trial would auto-renew at a monthly charge, specifically £6 for “Boost” and £9.99 for “Cinema”, unless they were cancelled within the free trial period. We acknowledged that those significant conditions were stated at the bottom of the two boxes detailing each of the streaming packages. When compared, however, to the other text presented in the box, we considered this information was in a smaller font and a less prominent colour. Furthermore, we noted that the text was positioned at the bottom of the boxes, underneath the buttons to select and purchase the consumer’s desired streaming package. We considered that, because the text was placed away from the references to the free trials and below the button to proceed in the consumer journey, consumers were more likely to overlook the significant conditions of the trials. We considered the presentation of such text made it significantly less prominent to consumers and increased the likelihood that consumers would miss that information. Because the text outlining the significant conditions of the free trials was not clear in either size or clarity of font and did not immediately follow the reference to the free trials, we concluded that the ad was misleading .The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 3.9 and 3.10 (Qualification).",The ad must not appear in its current form. We told Sky UK Ltd t/a Now TV to ensure that their ads made sufficiently clear that free trials would automatically auto-renew at a fee.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/sky-uk-ltd-a24-1229858-sky-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on SpinX Games Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on paid-for gambling-like ads, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 25 September 2024.","Two paid-for TikTok ads for SpinX Games Ltd, an online game provider, seen in March 2024: a. The first ad for the social casino game app “Jackpot Crush” featured a casino spinning wheel graphic in motion and exploding gold coins whilst slot machine sound effects could be heard. On-screen text against a background of casino slot machines stated, “Enjoy authentic casino slots online. Play now”. b. The second ad for the social casino game app “Wolf Run Eclipse” featured an image of a casino slot machine in use whilst slot machine sound effects could be heard. On-screen text stated, “MASSIVE WIN” and further text stated “In-game rewards are not real money” in small font.",The ASA challenged whether the ads misleadingly implied the social casino games were gambling products in which real-world money or tangible prizes could be won and withdrawn.,"SpinX Games Ltd t/a SpinX Games confirmed that players were unable to win real-world money or tangible prizes as a result of gameplay on the app. They highlighted that the game could be downloaded and played for free, and that in-app purchases were not required to enjoy the game. They believed that it was clear the game was designed for entertainment purposes only. They said that they implemented a number of disclosures detailing that across the consumer journey. They explained that, once a consumer clicked on the ad, they would be taken to the relevant app platform store. On those store listings for the game, further text stated that real-world money or tangible prizes could not be withdrawn and they also believed that consumer reviews on the store made that clear. They highlighted that, in order to play the games, consumers had to first download them from an app store and that it would be clear that there were no real-world money cash-outs. They also said consumers could download and play the games for free to get an understanding of the games before choosing to make any in-app purchases. As such, they believed it would be clear that there were no real-world money cash-outs or tangible rewards and prizes prior to making a transactional decision. They also referred to disclosures located within the game itself. They said that the app contained a “Responsible Gaming” notice in the settings section of the app, a frequently asked questions section, and Terms of Service, which consumers were required to confirm they had read, and that they all made it clear that there were no real money cash-outs or tangible prizes to be won and that the virtual coins and items had no real-world value. They also drew attention to the terminology used in the app, such as “game”, “gaming”, and “XP” (experience points), which they also believed made it clear that there were no real money cash-outs or tangible rewards and prizes. They also highlighted that a disclosure had been included in ad (b) which stated “in-game rewards are not real money”. However, they said they would make that disclosure more comprehensive, visible and prominent in future and they acknowledged that such a disclosure had been omitted from ad (a) due to an error. They believed the name of the app, “Jackpot Crush”, was representative of the nature of the game, specifically that it was a fun and free jackpot game. They said it was common in social casino games to use references to gambling terminology such as, “Jackpot”, “Vegas”, “casino”, “slots” and “poker”, as they were descriptive of the free gaming experience. In addition, the term “crush” was commonly associated with game apps, and further identified it as a free game. They said that many ads for gambling apps contained imagery of real people, used real monetary values or made references to currency and expressed offers of cash and other tangible prizes. They believed the animated content seen in the ads was more synonymous with games that did not have gambling elements or offer real-world money and that it was important to use content and sounds which reflected the gaming experience. The coins used in the ads were the virtual coins used in the game and did not represent or imitate real money. They said that they had processes in place to ensure advertising compliance and believed they had followed TikTok’s guidance for social casino games. Notwithstanding that, they confirmed that both ads had been removed from TikTok. TikTok said restrictions applied to the advertising of social casino games on their platform and that included the prohibition of content implying that users could earn real-world money or where direct comparisons to gambling were made. They said the ads had not breached TikTok ad policies.","The ASA understood that social casino apps emulated slot machines or other casino-based games. However, we understood consumers were unable to win or withdraw any real-world money or tangible prizes from such apps, and, therefore, they were not gambling products. We further understood that, whilst real-world money was not required to play, there were in-game purchase options available which enabled consumers to buy in-game currency or additional gameplay features. Ad (a) featured slot machine imagery, specifically, a spinning wheel graphic in the style of a roulette wheel with different prizes assigned to each segment of the wheel and large amounts of gold coins, accompanied by real-life slot machine sounds. We acknowledged that the ad was animated. However, we considered the roulette-style wheel with prizes ascribed to it, seen in tandem with coins, emulated casino-based gambling and we considered consumers would interpret that game within the context of a traditional casino game, and that real-world money could be won. Furthermore, the ad appeared against a backdrop of a building which appeared to represent a casino, as well as stylised images of slot machines. Alongside that, the ad referred to enjoying “authentic casino slots online”. We considered consumers would interpret those elements to mean that the game was similar to playing a traditional slot machine whereby it was possible to win and withdraw real-world money. Ad (b) featured a casino slot machine located in a casino, accompanied by slot machine sounds, and showed a large amount of gold coins. It also showed Wolf Eclipse icons and gameplay footage from the app on the casino slot machine, which we considered implied that the app was similar to a slot machine found in a casino and would offer consumers the opportunity to gamble and win real-world money or tangible prizes. That impression was further strengthened by the text “MASSIVE WIN” which appeared on the slot machine at the same time as an explosion of coins. We acknowledged that the ad featured the text “In-game rewards are not real money”. However, the text appeared at the bottom of the ad and was presented in a small white font, in contrast to the brightly coloured casino slot machine which changed colour in quick succession. We considered that contrast would have made it difficult for consumers to read the text. We also noted the text appeared on screen briefly before disappearing for the remainder of the ad. We considered that likely further impaired a consumer’s ability to sufficiently read and understand the information. We understood that Jackpot Crush and Wolf Run Eclipse were social casino apps and that neither real-world money nor prizes could be won through gameplay. We acknowledged that it was disclosed to consumers within the product listings on the app store, once the consumer clicked through from the ad. However, we considered that the ads themselves did not include information which made that clear to consumers. Transactional decisions encompassed a wide range of decisions made by the consumer in relation to a product and their decision of whether, how and on what terms to make a purchase. The decision to click through to the app from the ad was a transactional decision in relation to downloading the game, and we considered that consumers were not provided with information that was material to that decision. We further acknowledged the advertiser’s argument that the coins used in the ads were the virtual coins used in the gaming experience and did not represent real money and their belief that it was clear to consumers that real-world money could not be won. However, we considered that was not sufficient to dispel the overriding impression that real-world money or tangible prizes could be won by playing Jackpot Crush and Wolf Run Eclipse. Therefore, because we considered the claims and imagery featured in the ads gave the impression that the apps were a gambling product in which real-world money or tangible prizes could be won and withdrawn, we concluded that the ads were misleading and breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told SpinX Games Ltd t/a SpinX Games to ensure that they did not imply consumers could win real-world money or tangible prizes.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/spinx-games-ltd-a24-1241354-spinx-games-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on THG Beauty Ltd t/a Look Fantastic,"This case forms part of a wider piece of work on ads for affiliate marketing using intermediaries, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA.","An Instagram highlight on Erim Kaur’s account @erim labelled “Fragrance” featured a story, posted on 5 November 2023. The story included a reel with the text “4 long-lasting perfumes for Broke Girlies *all under £50”. A clickable link labelled “CHEAP & LONG LASTING PERFUMES” appeared below the reel, which directed to Ms Kaur’s LTK shop page.",The ASA challenged whether the story was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication.,"THG Beauty Ltd t/a Lookfantastic (THG), who sold three of the perfumes referenced in the ad, said they did not have a direct commercial relationship with Ms Kaur as she was not directly engaged as an influencer nor had she been gifted any products. However, they did have in place a sponsored campaign agreement with rewardStyle Inc t/a LTK. They explained that LTK operated a brand influencer platform through which influencers approved by LTK, and who contracted directly with LTK, were able to access affiliate links for brands which were also on the platform. In those circumstances the brands had no direct relationship with the influencers and did not necessarily know which influencers were posting content to promote their brands. THG did take steps nonetheless to ensure compliance with the CAP Code when working with LTK. Their agreement with them included that LTK ensure compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. All creators who sign up to the LTK platform were required to read and agree to LTK terms. Those terms included the requirement that all creators comply specifically with ASA guidelines and included a link to the CAP Influencers’ Guide to Making Clear that Ads are Ads. They said they would request that LTK re-issues prescriptive guidance to creators so that it is made clear that all iterations of an advert shared across social media outlets require compliance with the CAP Code and therefore must be made identifiable as a paid ad. Whilst they understood that the LTK landing page (both on mobile and desktop) was obviously identifiable as an advert and contained a prominent disclaimer that it contained paid links, they recognised it may not have been made sufficiently clear in Ms Kaur’s Story. Notwithstanding the fact that they had no direct commercial relationship with Ms Kaur, and therefore no direct editorial control over her posts, they recognised that the inclusion of an affiliate link for their brand being included in the story may be tantamount to a marketing communication under the CAP Code. In that scenario they acknowledged that it was their responsibility to take all necessary steps to ensure compliance. TFS Buying Ltd t/a The Fragrance Shop (TFS), who sold one of the perfumes referenced in the ad, said they did not have a direct commercial relationship with Ms Kaur, but that it did appear there is a commercial relationship between Ms Kaur and LTK. LTK were part of their affiliate network and there were contractual provisions between the parties to ensure compliance with the rules and regulatory guidance. LTK’s creator terms of business, to which creators are obliged to agree, included that ASA disclosure requirements must be adhered to. The affiliate link redirected to Ms Kaur’s LTK shop page rather than their website and the LTK page specified that the link to their website was a paid one. They also observed that the footage appears to have been recorded in a competitor’s shop and that it was therefore possible that Ms Kaur had inadvertently provided a link to their website on the TFS shop LTK page in error. Erim Kaur said she took the ASA guidelines seriously and was diligent at disclosing any paid collaboration, gifted product, or when mentioning her own brand. She apologised for the oversight in not disclosing the affiliate links and said they had been removed immediately. rewardStyle Inc t/a LTK said that they were a tech-enabled partner for creator guided shopping. They provided the technology that allowed influencers (“creators”) to create shoppable posts that drove trackable sales for brands. They noted that they were not the advertiser, nor the creator, and instead they provided the platform for which brands and creators could connect their products. The core service they offered was to allow creators to host “shops” on the platform. Through their shoppable LTK links, creators could be compensated for their posts, and brands could track and grow engagement and sales. They said that they took compliance with advertising regulations seriously and had policies in place that required the creators to adhere to all relevant legal and ethical standards. They required creators to include disclosures in their social media posts. They also included marketing disclosures next to the affiliate links on their platform. They highlighted that they had thousands of creators, and it was not possible for them to read every post. However, they did monitor their platform, and in cases of non-compliance, they would take action. In relation to the story, they agreed that it should have included disclosure in compliance with their guidelines and contractual requirements.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. The ASA first assessed whether the Instagram story was an ad. The story included an affiliate link that directed to Ms Kaur’s LTK shop page, which would earn Ms Kaur commission when products were purchased through the links on the platform. The story was therefore a marketing communication for the purposes of the Code. We then assessed whether the ad was obviously identifiable as such.The ad was an Instagram story which included a reel with the text “4 long-lasting perfumes for Broke Girlies *all under £50”. A clickable link labelled “CHEAP & LONG LASTING PERFUMES” appeared below the reel, which directed to Ms Kaur’s LTK shop page. We acknowledged that once consumers landed on the LTK shop page, built-in text on the platform stated “Paid links”. However, this was only visible to consumers after they had engaged with the link. Because consumers therefore had to engage with the ad before it was made clear that Ms Kaur would receive commission on purchases made via the links featured, we considered that this was insufficient to ensure that the story was obviously identifiable as an ad. We concluded that, in the absence of a clear and prominent identifier such as “ad”, the ad did not make its commercial intent clear from the outset and was not obviously identifiable as a marketing communication. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 (Recognition of marketing communications).","The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told THG Beauty Ltd, TFS Buying Ltd and Ms Kaur to ensure that their future ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications, that the commercial intent was made clear, and that identifiers such as “ad” were clearly and prominently displayed.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/thg-beauty-ltd-a24-1244192-thg-beauty-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Wenzhou Xinyu Maoyi Youxian Gongsi t/a XINYU TRADE,"This case forms part of a wider piece of work on ads for affiliate marketing using intermediaries, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA.","Two Instagram stories on Mel Lloyd’s account @my_neutral_place, posted on 24 March 2024: a. The first Instagram story featured a video of Ms Lloyd’s kitchen sink and tap with the text “Link to my sink (on my Amazon storefront)”. A clickable link labelled “Tap for sink [hand heart emoji]” directed to Ms Lloyd’s Amazon storefront page. b. The second Instagram story featured another video from Ms Lloyd’s kitchen, with the text “And the link to the tap (also Amazon)”. A clickable link labelled “LINK TO AMAZON TAP [hand heart emoji]” directed to Ms Lloyd’s Amazon storefront page.",The ASA challenged whether the stories were obviously identifiable as marketing communications.,"Wenzhou Xinyu Maoyi Youxian Gongsi t/a XINYU TRADE did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. Utsumi UK Ltd t/a Taps UK said that they had not worked with any influencers and had not offered any free products or compensation in exchange for advertising. Ms Lloyd said that she had purchased the products herself from Amazon and had no relationship with XINYU TRADE or Taps UK. She had not received payment, free products, or any other incentive, and had not been asked to post about the products by any brand (including Amazon). She confirmed that no person or advertising agency had any input in the creation of the stories besides herself. She stated that she was simply showing to her followers her new taps and was sharing where they could purchase them. She apologised for not marking the stories as ads and stated that she would ensure to mark all her ads and affiliate stories appropriately in future. The links took followers to her Amazon storefront where it stated “Earns commissions”, as well as “I’ve picked out my top picks of the Amazon home products that I can recommend honestly to you. You can buy the items by simply clicking on the product images. Please note that by using the links I will get a small percentage of the cost – there is absolutely no extra charge to you”. Amazon Europe Core Sàrl said they had policies that applied to all creators in their affiliate marketing programme, Amazon Associates, to ensure that they made the appropriate disclosures in relation to affiliate links. Where they became aware of creators failing to meet their policies, they reminded them of their obligation to appropriately disclose affiliate links, asked them to update their posts, and monitored their accounts in future.","The ASA was concerned by Wenzhou Xinyu Maoyi Youxian Gongsi t/a XINYU TRADE’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. The ASA first assessed whether the Instagram stories were ads. We understood that Ms Lloyd had purchased the products herself and had not received payment or any other incentive from XINYU TRADE or Taps UK, who we understood were the sellers of the products at the time the ads were seen. However, the stories included affiliate links that directed to Ms Lloyd’s Amazon storefront, which would earn Ms Lloyd commission when products were purchased through the link. The stories were therefore marketing communications for the purposes of the Code. We then assessed whether ads (a) and (b) were obviously identifiable as such. The ads were Instagram stories which featured photos of Ms Lloyd’s kitchen sink and tap, together with links to purchase them via her Amazon storefront. We considered that consumers would understand ads (a) and (b) to be documenting Ms Lloyd’s new home taps and sink, which she was sharing with her followers as recommendations without a financial incentive. We acknowledged that once consumers landed on Ms Lloyd’s Amazon storefront “Home décor & accessories” page, text prominently stated “Earns commissions”. However, this was only visible to consumers after they had engaged with the links. We also acknowledged that text appeared on Ms Lloyd’s main Amazon storefront page, along with a further statement to that effect in her bio, though, again, consumers would have to leave the “Home décor & accessories” page that the affiliate links directed to, in order to view that information. Because consumers therefore had to engage with the ads before it was made clear that they featured affiliate links, we considered that they were insufficient to ensure that the stories were obviously identifiable as ads. We concluded that in the absence of a clear and prominent identifier, such as “Ad”, ads (a) and (b) did not make their commercial intent clear from the outset and were not obviously identifiable as marketing communications. Ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 (Recognition of marketing communications).","The ads must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Wenzhou Xinyu Maoyi Youxian Gongsi t/a XINYU TRADE, Utsumi UK Ltd t/a Taps UK and Ms Lloyd to ensure that their future ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications, that the commercial intent was made clear, and that identifiers such as “ad” were clearly and prominently displayed.

ASA Ruling on Zeroo Gravity Games LLC t/a Cash Tornado,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on paid-for gambling-like ads, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 25 September 2024.","Two paid-for TikTok ads for Zeroo Gravity Games LLC, an online game provider, seen in March 2024: a. The first ad, for the social casino game app “Cash Tornado”, featured imagery of slot gameplay accompanied by slot machine sound effects matching the gameplay imagery of coins lining up. A voice-over and on-screen text across the gameplay imagery stated, “If you don’t hit 10 trillion coins within 10 spins Just delete the app. Cash Tornado is 100% FREE social slots game. Not only can you hit a big jackpot in just 10 spins but the payouts are EXTREMELY HIGH. Even if you only got a few coins you can still hit the jackpot of UP TO 20 TRILLION. With Cash Tornado you will win TRILLIONS MORE COINS in just an hour unlike if you would play any other slots game for entire week […] Trust me it won’t let you down.” The end of the ad featured cartoon text “EPIC WIN” and “1,262,839,35[…]” along with imagery of coins and diamonds exploding from behind the text before the ‘Cash Tornado’ logo was shown. b. The second ad for the social-casino game app “Jackpot Masters” featured animated imagery of the slot gameplay with voice-over and on-screen text that stated, “If you don’t hit a Jackpot of 10 trillion coins within 10 spins just delete the app. Jackpot Masters is a 100% free social slots game.” Further gameplay imagery displayed text that stated “CONGRATULATIONS you win 55 free spins” whilst the voice-over and on-screen text stated, “Not only can you hit a big jackpot in 10 spins” before more gameplay imagery accompanied by text that stated “But the payouts are also EXTREMELY HIGH. Even if you only got a few coins you can still hit the jackpot for UP TO 20 TRILLION. With Jackpot Master you will win trillions more coins in just an hour unlike if you would play any other slots game for an entire week […] Trust me it won’t let you down.” The end of the ad featured further gameplay imagery that showed a slot machine explode into coins and diamonds with cartoon text “Epic Win” with an increasing one trillion number counter before the “Jackpot Masters” logo.",The ASA challenged whether the ads misleadingly implied the social casino games were gambling products in which real-world money or tangible prizes could be won and withdrawn.,"Zeroo Gravity Games LLC said they published and distributed social casino-styled mobile games, including Las Vegas-inspired mini-games, that could be played for free. They confirmed that players were unable to win real-world money or tangible prizes as a result of gameplay on the app and that was made clear through explicit language in both the app store listing and Terms of Service users had to accept before being able to play the game. They said that, upon notification of the complaint, they had realised the ads had been placed without the appropriate disclaimers. As a result, they explained that they took immediate action to update the ads to include a disclaimer and would take steps to ensure a similar issue did not occur in the future. TikTok said restrictions applied to the advertising of social casino games on their platform and that included the prohibition of content implying that users could earn real-world money or where direct comparisons to gambling were made. They said the ads had breached TikTok ad policies, and as such, they had removed the ads from their platform.","The ASA understood that social casino apps emulated slot machines or other casino-based games. However, consumers were unable to win or withdraw any real-world money or tangible prizes from such apps, and therefore, they were not gambling products. We further understood that, whilst real-world money was not required to play, there were in-game purchase options available, which enabled consumers to buy in-game currency or additional gameplay features. The ads featured cartoon imagery of slot machine gameplay and images of coins, accompanied by slot machine sound effects. We considered that was similar to the type of gameplay seen in casino-based slot games, in which it was possible to win and withdraw real-world money in either the virtual or real-world casino environment. We therefore considered consumers would understand that using the app was akin to playing on a mobile slot or real-life slot machine, which involved gambling and the potential to win real-world money. The ads also referenced “hitting the jackpot” and referred to the payouts on the app being “EXTREMELY HIGH”. We considered the terms jackpot and payout were associated with gambling and that “hitting the jackpot” would be interpreted by consumers to mean winning the largest amount of money or prize available. Also, consumers would understand “payout” to be synonymous with other associated gambling terminology such as “withdraw” or “cash-out” and that, therefore, the term represented the amount of money they would win. We considered, therefore, consumers would understand that the apps offered an opportunity to gamble and they were able to withdraw any subsequent winnings. We also considered that the references to and imagery of coins, which emulated a prize display on casino-based slot machines, further reinforced the impression that it was possible to win and withdraw real-world money or another tangible prize. Similarly, we considered the names of the apps “Cash Tornado” and “Jackpot Masters” were both associated with prizes that could be won via gambling, and therefore we considered that consumers would understand the apps provided the opportunity to gamble, and should they have acquired any winnings, that it would be possible to withdraw them. However, we understood that “Cash Tornado” and “Jackpot Masters” were social casino apps through which it was not possible to win or withdraw real-world money or tangible prizes. Whilst we acknowledged that the ads both referenced the games as “social slots”, we considered that the average consumer would not be familiar with the term or that it referred to a game that emulated the slot machine experience without the ability to gamble or withdraw one’s winnings. We also acknowledged that the value of coins referenced in the ads was often fantastical, for example, the ability to win trillions of coins. We considered that consumers would likely understand they were not able to withdraw such vast amounts of money. However, they would assume that the amount of coins referred to in the ad would equate to a different value of real-world currency, which we understood was common practice for in-game currency within apps. As such, we did not consider the use of those figures would override the impression that consumers were able to withdraw real-world money. We also acknowledged that the app store listing and Terms of Service stated that players were unable to win real-world money or prizes. However, that was not sufficient to override the impression created by the ad. The decision to click through to the app store from the ad was a transactional decision in relation to downloading the game, and we considered that consumers were not provided with information in the ad itself that was material to that decision. Because we considered the ads gave the impression that the apps were gambling products in which real-world money could be won and withdrawn, when that was not the case, we considered the ads were misleading and concluded the ads breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Zeroo Gravity Games LLC to ensure they did not imply consumers could win real-world money or tangible prizes.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/zeroo-gravity-games-llc-a24-1241355-zeroo-gravity-games-llc.html
ASA Ruling on Excite For Life Ltd,"Following intelligence gathering by the ASA, this ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ads making claims that CBD (cannabidiol) is suitable for consumption by children. See also related ruling published on 18 September 2024. Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website for the CBD product retailer Excite For Life, www.exciteforlife.co.uk, seen on 25 April 2024, included a webpage, accessible via the “Shop” drop-down menu, titled “CBD For Children”. It featured six product listings for CBD products, including “Broad Spectrum CBD Gummies – Zero THC”, “CBD Vegan Gummies – Zero THC” and “Full Spectrum Water Soluble CBD Drops”. The listings hyperlinked to product pages with further details. Underneath the product listings and the heading “Buy CBD For Children”, a video appeared with the on-screen text “CBD SAFE FOR CHILDREN?” in which a woman described CBD as safe for children alongside suggestions on consumption amounts. She also stated, “As an adult I always say to people to start on 10 mg a day. In the UK they say not to exceed 70 mg a day. Not that there is [sic] any side effects, you can’t overdose on CBD. They just say 70 mg, I’m not sure why, but that’s just what they say.” Below the video, text stated “Are you looking for a safe and natural way to help balance the wellbeing of your child? CBD has been used successfully by many parents, and we are here to help […] With no side effects and no possibility of overdosing on CBD, you can rest assured knowing that this is a secure holistic supplement for your child”. The product webpage for “Broad Spectrum CBD Gummies – Zero THC” included the subheading “How to Use” under which text stated “For children we would suggest starting on around 10mg a day so these gummies can be cut in half. After several days, if necessary, you can increase by double”. The product webpage for “CBD Vegan Gummies – Zero THC” also included a “How to Use” subheading, under which text stated “For children we would suggest starting on 10mg a day and increasing gradually if necessary. You can go up to 40mg a day for a child.” The product webpage for “Full Spectrum Water Soluble CBD Drops 400mg from CBDLife” included the text “Great for children as you can add these to their drink”.","The ASA challenged whether the following claims were misleading and could be substantiated, that: 1. CBD was suitable for consumption by children; and 2. in the UK the recommended maximum consumption of CBD per day for adults was 70 mg. 3. The ASA also challenged whether the health claim that CBD “helps balance the wellbeing of your child” complied with the Code.","1. Excite For Life Ltd stated that they were unaware of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) guidance advising against CBD use by vulnerable groups, including children under 18, despite their six years in the CBD industry. They had removed the product category and references to children from the relevant webpages. 2. Excite for Life said that when they started selling CBD, the recommended limit for adult consumption of CBD was 200 mg per day. In 2020, it was reduced to 70 mg, so their advertising claims were based on those limits. They were unaware of the new advice recommending a daily limit of 10 mg, but noted the FSA guidance referred to it as “precautionary advice” and stated that there was no acute safety risk with consuming more than that, based on the data they had assessed up to that point. 3. They said they had been told they could reference “wellbeing”, but had now removed the claim from the website.","The ad appeared on a webpage titled “CBD for Children”. It claimed that CBD was safe for children, describing it as a “secure holistic supplement.” The ad further claimed that CBD had “no side effects” and that there was no risk of overdosing when used by children. It was also described as safe for children in a video featured on the webpage. The ASA therefore considered that consumers would understand from the ad that it was suitable for children to consume CBD products, with no safety concerns or risks. Additionally, they would expect that this was aligned with official guidance from relevant regulatory bodies such as the FSA. However, the FSA’s guidance stated that they did not recommend CBD for people in vulnerable groups, including children under the age of 18. We concluded that the claims were therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading Advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). Regarding the recommended maximum consumption of CBD per day for adults, the ad stated “In the UK, they say not to exceed 70 mg a day. Not that there is [sic] any side effects, you can’t overdose on CBD. They just say 70 mg, I’m not sure why, but that’s just what they say”. We considered consumers would understand that these claims reflected up-to-date guidance from the relevant regulatory body. However, the FSA’s advice had been updated, to recommend that healthy adults limit their intake of CBD from food to 10 mg per day, in October 2023, seven months before the ad was seen by the ASA. We concluded that the claims were therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading Advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). The CAP Code defined claims which referenced the general benefits of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health-related wellbeing as general health claims. Such claims were acceptable in ads only if accompanied by a specific health claim that was authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims Register. We considered consumers would understand the claim that CBD was a “safe and natural way to help balance the wellbeing of your child” as a reference to the general benefits of CBD, including Excite For Life’s products, for the overall physical and mental health of children. The claim was therefore a general health claim that needed to be accompanied by a specific authorised health claim relating to CBD. However, the ad did not - and could not - include such a claim, because there were no authorised health claims for CBD. That claim also therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 15.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Excite For Life Ltd not to make claims that CBD was suitable or safe for consumption by children, or that the recommended maximum consumption of CBD per day for adults was 70 mg. We told them to ensure that their claims relating to the suitability of CBD consumption for different groups, and about recommended daily CBD consumption limits, was always in line with FSA guidance. We also told them not to make general health claims unless they were accompanied by a specific authorised health claim.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/excite-for-life-ltd-a24-1243213-excite-for-life-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on NothingFishy Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Instagram post, posted by @wearenothingfishy, a retailer of food supplements, seen on 3 April 2024, showed a hand holding a jar of food supplements labelled “Omega 3 – Plant based Softgels”. A testimonial attributed to “Karl” stated “I was hard hit with COVID. Now my hair’s growing back & the brain fog started to lift”. The jar was surrounded by captions, each with a “+” sign and a different emoji symbol, which stated respectively “Focus”, “Joint Relief”, “Energy” and “Mental Health”. A “SHOP NOW” button appeared at the bottom of the post.","1. The complainant challenged whether the claims that the Omega 3 food supplement could help with Covid-19 and/or Long Covid and their symptoms, “joint relief” and “mental health” were claims to treat or cure human disease that were in breach of the Code. 2. The ASA challenged whether the ad also included health claims which were in breach of the Code.",,"The ASA was concerned by NothingFishy’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code prohibited claims that stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease.We considered the testimonial attributed to “Karl” which stated “I was hard hit with COVID. Now my hair’s growing back & the brain fog started to lift” implied that “Karl” had experienced hair loss and “brain fog” as symptoms of Covid-19 and/or Long Covid. In the context of the ad, this suggested that the Omega 3 food supplement was able to treat and/or relieve those symptoms of Covid-19 and Long Covid. The ad also featured the claims “focus”, “joint relief”, “energy” and “mental health” in the captions surrounding the jar of the product. In the context of the testimonial’s reference to “COVID”, we considered those claims were likely to be understood by a significant proportion of consumers as referring to symptoms of Covid-19 and Long Covid, such as “brain fog”, joint aches and pains, low energy and poor mental health. We considered that consumers would therefore understand those claims to be that the Omega 3 supplement would treat these specific symptoms of Covid-19 and Long Covid. We further considered that some consumers may understand the claims “joint relief” and “mental health” to mean that the supplement could also help with joint conditions and mental health conditions that were not associated with Covid-19 or Long Covid. The ad included implied claims that the Omega 3 supplement could treat symptoms of Covid-19 and/or Long Covid and treat joint conditions and mental health conditions not associated with Covid-19 or Long Covid. However, such claims were prohibited for food and food supplements. We therefore concluded the ad was in breach of the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register) were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health.In addition to the interpretation of the claims set out in point 1 above, we considered other consumers may interpret the claims “focus” and “energy” to mean that the Omega 3 supplement could provide health benefits outside of a COVID context, such as helping with cognitive function and energy levels. These claims were therefore health claims. However, there were no health claims authorised on the GB Register in relation to Omega 3. The claims therefore breached the Code. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told NothingFishy Ltd to ensure their ads did not make claims that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure human disease. We also told them to ensure any specific health claims were authorised on the GB Register and complied with the conditions of use for those claims. We referred the matter to CAP's Compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/nothingfishy-ltd-a24-1240828-nothingfishy-ltd.html

""Moncrief products have continually featured in the top international fashion magazines"".","1. Sterling Wholesale Ltd t/a Moncrief explained that they sold products under both the Moncrief and Moncrief London lines. They confirmed that the bespoke leather products under the Moncrief main line were made in Italy but not the items under the Moncrief London line. They said confusion may have arisen by offering both brands on the same website, but in future they would ensure the “Dispatch and Delivery” section clarified the origin of each brand. They further explained that the Moncrief London leather bags were hand finished and therefore not mass produced. 2. They said that Moncrief products had previously featured in top magazines as they showed on their website.","The ASA acknowledged Moncrief’s statement that the bespoke leather products under the Moncrief main line were made in Italy, and the Moncrief London leather bags were hand finished. However, the ASA considered consumers would understand the text “Each item is handmade in Italy”, and the descriptions of the production process on the “heritage” webpage, to mean that all the Moncrief products on the website were handmade in Italy, regardless of the line they were from. In the absence of relevant documentary evidence to substantiate the claim that each item in both the Moncrief main line and the Moncrief London line was handmade in Italy, we concluded that the claim “Each item is handmade in Italy” was misleading and had not been substantiated. On this issue, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). We considered consumers would understand from the text ""Moncrief products have continually featured in the top international fashion magazines"", alongside images of magazines including Vogue Business, Vanity Fair, Pomp, and Financial Times Travel Unravelled, that Moncrief products had frequently been included in prominent global fashion magazines, including the ones featured in the graphic. We acknowledged Moncrief’s comment that their products had previously featured in top magazines, but had not received evidence to substantiate that their products had frequently appeared in such publications, as claimed.

They said that the information on their website regarding both claims was based on outdated guidance and was written prior to the latest update from the FSA. They apologised for the discrepancies and removed both claims from the relevant webpages.

Additionally, they would expect that this was aligned with official guidance from relevant regulatory bodies such as the FSA. However, the FSA’s guidance stated that they did not recommend CBD for people in vulnerable groups, including children under the age of 18.

ASA Ruling on Vodafone Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A TV ad, paid-for X (formerly Twitter) ad and website for Vodafone: a. The TV ad, seen on 21 March 2024 featured a voice-over that stated, “The Great British broadband switch is here. And millions of BT customers across the UK are realising they can switch to Vodafone and get the same broadband for less. That’s right, the same broadband for less. Now is a great time to switch to Vodafone. Join the Great British broadband switch. Search Vodafone broadband to see what you could save.” Small on-screen text displayed throughout the ad stated “Vodafone new customers, 24m plans (on Openreach network) pay less on avg vs BT’s public prices for comparable existing customers [sic] plans, as of March 2024, verify: Vodafone.co.uk/broadband”. b. The paid-for X ad, seen on 8 April 2024, stated “Get the same broadband technology for less when you switch from BT to Vodafone” in both the caption and accompanying image. Small text at the bottom of the image stated “Vodafone new customers, 24m plans (Openreach network Full Fibre technology) pay less on avg vs BT’s public prices for comparable existing customers’ plans, as of March 2024, verify: Vodafone.co.uk/broadband”. Text underneath the image stated “The Great British Broadband Switch”. c. A page on Vodafone’s website, www.vodafone.co.uk, seen on 26 April 2024 , relating to Vodafone’s home broadband offerings, stated “Our best broadband deals Switch from BT to Vodafone and get the same broadband for less” and “THE GREAT BRITISH BROADBAND SWITCH"". Further down the page a subheading stated “Same broadband and landline for less Same technology, same network – and it’s never been easier to switch. At Vodafone, we use the same technology as BT but we’ll cost you less”. A table underneath compared aspects of Vodafone’s and BT’s ‘Full Fibre 2’ plans, including speed, price and contract length. Further detail explained the basis of the calculation in a drop-down box, which also included a link to a page that hosted a pdf document with verification information.","British Telecommunications plc (BT) challenged whether the claims: 1. in all three ads that Vodafone provided the “same broadband”, or the same broadband “technology”, as BT for less, were misleading and could be substantiated, because they believed Vodafone’s broadband did not provide the same performance; and 2. “millions of BT customers across the UK are realising they can switch to Vodafone and get the same broadband for less” in ad (a) was misleading and could be substantiated, because they did not believe millions of BT customers had switched or were considering doing so.","1. Vodafone Ltd said the purpose of the campaign was to educate consumers that broadband services that were being delivered using the same network technology tended to perform similarly, and that ultimately that could help them save money. They said consumers very often did not understand the technicalities of broadband services and ended up paying a lot more for negligible performance differences between competitor providers, which often fluctuated. They said improved performance could be achieved in numerous ways, including ways that were outside of the providers’ control. However, they said that Ofcom had confirmed there were few differences between comparable services offered by providers that used the same wholesale input from Openreach. The references to the “same broadband” and the “same broadband technology” were based on an Ofcom technical report published in September 2023. The report reviewed UK home broadband performance during March 2023. Its purpose was to understand broadband performance in UK households, using data predominantly collected by an independent third party. Vodafone considered a key finding was that performance varied by plan and technology, but “[…] broadband services using the same wholesale input tended to perform similarly”, and that Ofcom “[…] found few differences between comparable services offered by providers such as BT, EE, Plusnet, Sky and TalkTalk, which use the same Openreach wholesale inputs.” They acknowledged that the report did not use the word “same” to describe broadband performance across providers, but given that Ofcom was of the view that performance was similar, Vodafone considered the wording in the ads was adequate. Vodafone said that small print in the ads made clear that the comparison related to services delivered via the same “wholesale input”, by referencing the Openreach network. For example, the TV ad stated “[…] 24m plans (on Openreach network) pay less on avg vs BT’s public prices for comparable existing customers [sic] plans […]”. The small print also directed viewers to Vodafone’s website where a verification document included information which explained the reasoning behind the ads’ reference to the “same broadband”. The network technologies encompassed by the claims in ads (a) and (c) were Openreach Single order Generic Ethernet Access (SoGEA, also known as Fibre-to-the-cabinet or FTTC) and Openreach Fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP). SoGEA was defined as partial fibre broadband using fibre optic cable from the exchange to the nearest street cabinet, and then copper cable from the street cabinet to the home. FTTP used fibre optic cable all the way from the local exchange to the home. The claim in ad (b), which referred to “Openreach network Full Fibre technology” in the small print, related to Openreach FTTP specifically. Vodafone said that any average consumer could understand that, given the same method or technology being used, they would be getting the same broadband. They recognised that the references to broadband “technology” in the claims in the X and website ads could be seen as providing further clarification, by highlighting that they were addressing the technology side of the broadband. However, they firmly believed that the claims which did not refer to “broadband technology” were not misleading to consumers, because the broadband being delivered using the same wholesale input performed similarly, and that was adequately substantiated. They provided tables in which they compared the average price per month of Vodafone and BT plans. One table related to March 2024 only, and the other averaged prices between March 2023 and March 2024. The compared plans used the same network technologies and provided the same speeds, with two exceptions: the “Fibre 1” products from both providers, using SoGEA, where BT offered speeds of 50 Mbps and Vodafone 38 Mbps; and the fastest Full Fibre plans, using FTTP, where BT offered speeds of 900 Mbps and Vodafone 910 Mbps. Vodafone’s prices were cheaper in all instances. Responding in relation to the TV ad (a), Clearcast said they had requested Vodafone show them the basis for the comparison, emphasising that it should be like-for-like across all their broadband plans. Vodafone had confirmed that Vodafone and BT used the same technology for their Fibre 1 and Fibre 2 plans, and provided the Ofcom technical report in support. That confirmed that broadband services using the same wholesale input all performed similarly. Vodafone also provided Clearcast with evidence that they offered the same broadband plans as BT (i.e., the same technology and same speed) for less. The data showed they were cheaper for broadband at the time the ad would first be broadcast, as well as averaged over the previous year. Clearcast had requested that Vodafone add on-screen text to clarify what the claim was based on and to provide viewers with a website address where they could review the details of the comparison. 2. Vodafone understood BT had around eight million home broadband customers, based on BT’s own public financial reporting. Because Vodafone’s comparable home broadband services were cheaper, if all those millions of BT customers switched to Vodafone, they would save money. They said the purpose of the claim “millions of BT customers across the UK are realising they can switch to Vodafone and get the same broadband for less” was to bring BT’s customer base to the realisation that switching could save money. The wording that customers “are realising” indicated a trend or movement. Clearcast said they had approved the claim “millions of customers” on the basis that BT’s broadband customer base was, at the time, estimated at eight million. Because Vodafone had demonstrated to them that switching to Vodafone from BT could bring savings for customers, they felt that was sufficient rationale to support the claim.","The TV ad, ad (a), stated that BT customers could get “the same broadband” with Vodafone. It featured visuals of a red light zooming along streets and between buildings, cut with shots of people in their homes using internet-connected devices and noticing the red light as it went past their window. The ASA considered that a significant proportion of viewers would understand the claim’s reference to “the same” broadband to mean that the performance of Vodafone’s broadband services would be nearly identical to BT’s. Reinforced by the visuals, we considered the claim would be understood to refer to the performance a consumer would experience when connecting to their broadband, based on the entire connection. We understood the entire connection included the internet service provider’s (ISP) core network, the Openreach network, its connection into the home, and the connection between the router and any internet-enabled device. While the small on-screen text stated “24m plans (on Openreach network)” we considered it was not clearly linked to the main claim, nor was it worded in such a way that it clarified that the main claim was intended to refer only to that part of the connection comprised of Openreach’s network. Notwithstanding that, we considered that many consumers would not be familiar with the various technical elements of the broadband network infrastructure and so would not know what was meant by “on Openreach network”. The X ad stated in the caption and on the accompanying image that BT customers who switched to Vodafone could get “the same broadband technology”. We considered consumers would understand the claim in the same way as “the same broadband”, albeit that the nearly identical performance could be specifically ascribed to nearly identical technology over the entire connection. Text on the image included “(Openreach network Full Fibre technology)”. We considered most consumers were likely to overlook this because it was in very small font. However, even those who read it would interpret it, in the context of the full wording, to mean that the price comparison related only to comparable “Full Fibre” (FTTP) plans. They would not understand it to mean that the main claim was intended to refer only to the part of the internet connection comprised of Openreach’s network. Additionally, as referenced above, many consumers would not know what was meant by “Openreach network”. The website, ad (c), featured the claim “the same broadband” at the top of the page. The claim was repeated further down the page alongside references to the “same technology” and “same network”. In that context, we considered the claims would together be understood in the same way as the claim in ad (b). The webpage also included reference to aspects of Vodafone’s Wi-Fi as being a reason to switch, which we considered reinforced the impression that the claim related to performance based on the entire internet connection. Additionally, while the webpage focused on “Full Fibre” plans, we considered consumers would not interpret that to mean that the “same” claims were intended to refer only to the part of the internet connection comprised of Openreach’s network. BT’s complaint focused on the fact that ISPs had their own core networks, to which the Openreach network connected. The core networks included elements over which they had direct control, which could be adjusted to affect performance. They argued that the broadband provided by different ISPs therefore was not “the same”. We understood that aspects of core networks could differ between ISPs. That could include, for example, their specific peering and transit networks, and actions they took to optimise performance such as optimising configurations, load balancing, or using the most advanced hardware and software. We considered that consumers would interpret the claims in all three ads as having the primary meaning that, in practice, BT customers who switched to Vodafone would get nearly identical broadband performance. We expected to see evidence that was the case. However, we also considered the “same broadband technology” claims in ads (b) and (c) ascribed the performance to the use of nearly identical technology. We therefore expected to see substantiation that Vodafone’s core network was nearly identical to BT’s in support of those claims, but we had not seen evidence in that regard. We reviewed the Ofcom report. We acknowledged the report’s summary statement that comparable services which used the same Openreach infrastructure “tended to perform similarly” and that they “found few differences”. However, we considered it was therefore clear that there were some differences in performance; the services were not nearly identical in their performance. We also noted that the report’s reference to finding “few differences” between comparable services mentioned several specific providers including BT, but not Vodafone. We concluded the report’s summary statement was therefore not adequate to support Vodafone’s advertising claims that they provided the “same broadband” and the “same broadband technology” as BT, as interpreted by consumers. We understood Vodafone offered six broadband plans which were comparable to BT plans: two FTTC and four FTTP. However, the Ofcom report included data on only one Vodafone broadband service – their 67 Mbps FTTC plan. While the report included data for a comparable BT service, the evidence did not relate to all six of the broadband plans included in the ads’ comparisons. The data was also collected in March 2023, one year before the ads were published. Furthermore, we understood that the performance metric data collated in the Ofcom report was collected at the router, rather than by connected devices. We acknowledged this was a robust methodology which factored out the potential for metrics to be affected by Wi-Fi bandwidth. However, because the claims in the ads would be understood to relate to the full internet connection up to the device, rather than to the router, we considered the data did not support the claims. For those reasons, we considered the comparative data in the Ofcom report did not support the advertising claims as they would be understood by consumers. We had not seen evidence which supported claims that BT customers who switched to Vodafone would, in practice, get nearly identical performance, including through the use of nearly identical technology. Therefore, we concluded the claims “the same broadband” and “the same broadband technology” had not been substantiated and were misleading. On that point, ad (a) breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation), 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors) and 3.39 (Price comparisons).Ads (b) and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors) and 3.39 (Price comparisons). 2. Upheld The TV ad (a) stated that “millions of BT customers across the UK are realising they can switch to Vodafone and get the same broadband for less”. We considered that claim would be understood by viewers to be an objective claim that millions of people had come to this realisation already and had either switched from BT to Vodafone or were actively considering doing so. We further considered that the impression that there was a growing trend of people switching from BT to Vodafone was likely to have a more persuasive effect in encouraging viewers to look into switching than if the ad had not referenced that “millions of BT customers […] are realising they can switch”. Vodafone had said the purpose of the ad was to bring BT’s customer base to the realisation that switching could save them money. The ad itself was therefore intended to educate BT customers about Vodafone’s pricing compared to BT, rather than informing them of an evidenced trend of people switching that was already occurring. Because we had not seen evidence to substantiate the claim that millions of BT broadband customers already had switched, or were actively considering switching, to Vodafone, we concluded the claim was misleading. On that point, ad (a) breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation), 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Vodafone Ltd not to state or imply that their broadband services provided a nearly identical performance to BT’s services, including through the use of nearly identical technology, unless they held evidence to support those claims. We also told them not to state or imply that millions of BT broadband customers already had switched, or were actively considering switching, to Vodafone unless they held evidence.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/vodafone-ltd-a24-1241350-vodafone-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Femgroup Ltd t/a Feminapause,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ads making claims about the treatment of symptoms of the menopause. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad for Feminapause, a supplement brand, seen on 27 March 2024, featured an image that contained the claim “95% Success Rate in Menopause Relief”, and, in a smaller pink box within the image, the claim “FSA APPROVED” alongside the Food Standards Agency name and logo. The accompanying caption stated “FeminapauseTM. Pioneering Natural Menopause Relief since 2019 by using the most effective, highest quality ingredients. The only FSA Approved menopause supplement”. The caption included a list, bulleted by green check mark emojis, which stated “Experience relief from: Night sweats Intense hot flashes Frustrating brain fog episodes Sleep disturbances”. Underneath the image, alongside a button to “Shop Now”, was again the claim “The only FSA approved menopause supplement”.","The ASA challenged whether the claims: 1. that stated or implied the supplement could help to treat or cure symptoms of menopause were in breach of the Code; and 2. “The only FSA approved menopause supplement”, “FSA APPROVED” and the imagery of the Food Standards Agency name and logo implied endorsement or approval from the Food Standards Agency.","1. Femgroup Ltd t/a Feminapause said that the claims were supported by research that had been conducted by the advertising team into reviews, feedback and testimonials of thousands of their customers. They said that they had many testimonials from customers who had experienced relief from the symptoms of menopause after taking the product. 2. Feminapause explained that the product contained CBD, which was classified as a novel food by the FSA. They clarified that it was listed on the FSA register of CBD products linked to novel food applications and had passed the initial approval stage.","The CAP Code (which reflected legislation) prohibited claims that stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease.The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the claims “95% Success Rate in Menopause Relief” and “Pioneering Natural Menopause Relief since 2019” that the supplement product was intended to treat or cure the symptoms associated with menopause. We noted that the ad further specified that consumers of the product could expect to experience relief from: “Night sweats”, “Intense hot flashes”, “Frustrating brain fog episodes” and “Sleep disturbances”. We considered those claims would be understood to mean that the food supplement could treat or cure problems with sleep, hot flushes, and problems with memory and concentration, which were, as implied by the ad, specific symptoms associated with menopause. We considered that the claims, that the supplement could treat or cure symptoms of the menopause, both in general terms and in relation to specifically described symptoms, were for the purposes of the legislation reflected in the Code, claims to treat disease. Such claims were prohibited for food and food supplements.We concluded that the ad made claims that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure disease and therefore it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code required that marketing communications must not claim that the advertised product had been approved, endorsed or authorised by any public or other body if it had not, or without complying with the terms of the approval, endorsement or authorisation. We considered that consumers would understand the references in the ad to “FSA APPROVED” and “the only FSA approved menopause supplement” to mean that the product had been approved by the Food Standards Agency via a formal process. Where it appeared in the caption, the statement “the only FSA Approved menopause supplement” was preceded by the claim that the product contained “the most effective, highest quality ingredients”. The statement “Highest Quality Ingredients” also appeared as one of three points on a checklist on the graphic. We considered that the repetition of both claims meant that consumers would understand that the FSA had approved the supplement based on the criteria of the quality of the ingredients and their efficacy in treating symptoms of the menopause, and that the supplement was unique on that basis. While not stated in the ad itself, the product contained CBD oil and as such, was considered a ‘novel food’ by the FSA. The product was therefore required to go through an authorisation process, administered by the FSA, to ensure that it had been fully assessed and confirmed to be safe for consumption. The authorisation process for novel foods was intended to establish the product’s safety, and was not an assessment of its quality or efficacy, as we considered consumers would understand from the claims in the ad. In addition, we noted that the advertiser’s application was still under review. The status of the application was ‘validated’, having been confirmed by the FSA as containing the required information to progress the application. This did not constitute authorisation of the product as a novel food, nor did this guarantee that authorisation would be granted. Because the ad implied that the FSA approval was based on the quality or efficacy of the product, when in fact it was a requirement for products of this kind, we concluded the claim that the product had been approved, endorsed or authorised by the FSA was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.50 (Endorsements and testimonials).","The ad must not appear again. We told Femgroup Ltd t/a Feminapause not to state or imply their food supplements could prevent, treat or cure human disease, which for the purposes of the Code included claims to treat or cure the symptoms of menopause. We also told them to ensure that future marketing communications did not state or imply that the product had been approved, endorsed or authorised by the FSA.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/femgroup-ltd-a24-1241017-femgroup-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Nasty Gal Ltd,,"An Instagram post by @nastygal, seen on 3 December 2023, featured an image of a woman on the phone, with text stating “$1000 Cash. That’s hot”. The caption on the post stated “12 days of Christmas Giveaways” Day 3 of #Nasty12DaysofChristmas Win a $1000 CASH. To enter simply: 1. Follow Nasty Gal. 2. Like this post. 3. Leave a comment with a [flying money emoji]. 4. Tag a friend for an extra entry. Winner announced 12.10.23. T&C’s apply. #NastyGalsDoItBetter”.","The complainant, who understood that no announcement confirming the winner had been published despite requests from Nasty Gal’s followers for that information, challenged whether the promotion had been administered fairly.","Nasty Gal Ltd confirmed that the announcement date for the promotion was scheduled for 10 December. They said the exact date that a winner was announced could not be ascertained due to the time elapsed since the promotion was run. They said they had direct correspondence with the winner from around 11 December and internal emails from 12 December concerning the processing of the prize, meaning it was highly likely the winner was announced within the specified time period. Nasty Gal said they replied to the winner’s comment on the post to announce them as the winner of the promotion. They confirmed that their comment was the only manner in which the winner was announced. They believed that announcing competition winners via the comments section was standard practice for influencers and those within the fashion industry on social media. They understood that the algorithm used by Instagram to order comments on a post prioritised comments based on audience size, interaction, and author status. Nasty Gal said that their account had 4.5m followers, all entrants had interacted with the post, and Nasty Gal was the author of the post itself. They therefore believed the comment announcing the winner would have been extremely likely to show up in the top ten comments on the post when viewed by entrants. They believed an entrant would have visited the post, seen the caption which stated that the winner was announced on 10 December 2023, opened the comments, and seen almost immediately that the winner had been announced. They added that there was currently no guidance which stated that competition winners could not be announced via the comments section. They also said all entrants had access to the T&Cs which they believed clearly set out how and when the winner announcement would take place.","The CAP Code required promoters to either publish or make available information that indicated that a valid award took place and to provide that information to the ASA if challenged. The ASA acknowledged that Nasty Gal believed that through replying to the winner’s valid entry comment in the comments section of the post they had announced the winner and therefore satisfied the relevant requirement of the Code. We understood that the winner was not announced through any other mechanism, for example, by editing the caption of the post so that Instagram users could re-visit the post to see that a winner had been selected. We understood that there were thousands of comments on the post, which we considered meant Instagram users were extremely unlikely to know that a winner had been announced without clicking into and looking at the comments section below the post. Although we acknowledged that the algorithm used by Instagram to order comments considered a variety of factors, we considered it could not be relied upon to ensure Nasty Gal’s comment was one of the top comments and therefore easily accessible to entrants. We also considered that, even if that were the case, a user would still have needed to interact with the post and scroll through at least the first few comments to see that a winner had been selected. We also understood some users had commented on the post asking whether or not a winner had been announced, which we considered further suggested that replying to the winner directly, on a post with thousands of comments, was not a sufficient way of announcing that a valid award had taken place. Because Nasty Gal had not published or otherwise made available information which clearly announced that a winner had been selected, we concluded the promotion had not been conducted fairly and that it breached the Code. The promotion breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules, 8.2 (Promotional marketing) and 8.28.5 (Prize promotions).",The promotion must not be run again in the form complained of. We told Nasty Gal Ltd to ensure in future promotions they clearly publish or make available information to indicate that a valid award has taken place.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/nasty-gal-ltd-a24-1239263-nasty-gal-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on 247 Home Furnishings Ltd t/a 247Blinds,,"A website for 247Blinds, www.247blinds.co.uk, seen on 8 July 2024, included the text that stated “Made-to-Measure Quality Blinds…WITHOUT HAVING YOUR EYES OUT! […] Blind envy starts here…” alongside an image of a person with paint splatters and stars over their eyes.","The complainant, who was severely sight impaired, challenged whether the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread offence.","247 Home Furnishings t/a 247 Blinds stated that the term “having your eyes out” was widely recognised as an expression used to signify someone’s eyes popping out in disbelief to show unfavourable surprise when faced with something that was overpriced. Their intention was to convey that customers would be pleasantly surprised by their prices and so would not “have their eyes out” when they saw them. Whilst they acknowledged that the play on words “Quality Blinds” may have been seen as in poor taste, they believed that most people would have found it humorous, rather than seriously offensive. This was the only complaint they had received and it had been viewed on their website by 182,000 users and had been shown on various online platforms, resulting in over 1.7 million impressions during this period. The campaign finished at the end of July and would no longer be available online.","The CAP Code required marketers to ensure that ads did not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence, with particular care to be taken to avoid causing offence on the grounds of various protected characteristics, including disability. We acknowledged that the claim “Quality Blinds” was intended as a humorous play on words related to the advertiser’s product, window blinds, and the verb, to blind. We also acknowledged that the claim “Having your eyes out” was an expression known to some people to mean your eyes popping out in disbelief at something, for example, a high price. However, we considered that all the elements of the ad seen together, the play on words, “Quality Blinds”, the use of the expression “WITHOUT HAVING YOUR EYES OUT!” and the image of the person with stars and paint splatters covering their eyes, would be understood as a reference to blindness, and had the effect of making light of the disability. We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious offence to some people. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 4.1 (Harm and Offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told 247 Home Furnishings Ltd t/a 247 Blinds to ensure that their future ads did not cause serious or widespread offence, particularly on the grounds of disability.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/247-home-furnishings-ltd-a24-1251708-247-home-furnishings-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Mayborn (UK) Ltd t/a Tommee Tippee,,"A paid-for Instagram ad for infant care company Tommee Tippee, seen on 28 March. The caption stated “A bottle feeding game-changer. Expertly engineered to prevent colic, gas, and reflux in ways that’ve never been seen before”. At the bottom of the ad was text which stated ""Colicsoothe: Colic relief with one press"". Above was a video which featured the product named “Colicsoothe”. Text overlaying the video stated “A ground-breaking anti-colic innovation has landed … Colicsoothe. Engineered to prevent colic in ways that have never been seen before … Vacuum technology removes air from baby’s milk … Even less gas … Even less stress … Even more sleep”.",The complainant challenged whether the efficacy claims related to colic were misleading and could be substantiated.,"Mayborn (UK) Ltd t/a Tommee Tippee said that authorities including the NHS, regarded colic as inconsolable crying affecting an otherwise healthy baby for three or more hours, for at least three days a week, for three weeks or more. They stated that generally understood signs of colic included intense and extreme crying for several hours, burping often or passing a lot of gas, babies curling their legs up towards their belly when crying, clenching their fists when crying, having a red or flushed face when crying, and/or being inconsolable to the extent that nothing the parent did seemed to make it better. Tommee Tippee said the product was not a medicine, beauty product, medical device, or health related product. Colicsoothe was a small chamber into which an open bottle of baby milk was placed. The product generated a vacuum, which removed dissolved air from the milk. Tommee Tippee stated they worked with an external third party in June and July 2022 to arrange a Colicsoothe product trial. That trial was carried out with 51 parents, over a six-day period, all of whom had confirmed that their babies suffered from the symptoms of colic. The parents were asked to record the number of minutes their baby cried prior to starting the trial, and then on each of the six days whilst using the product. The average time recorded for crying reduced from 91 minutes prior to starting to use the machine to 42.5 minutes after six days of using the machine, based on reporting from parents. The vast majority of parents reported that the product reduced the symptoms of colic, including gassiness and crying. Furthermore, 58% of parents said their baby slept better after using the product. Tommee Tippee acknowledged that they did not hold documentary evidence to substantiate that Colicsoothe could prevent colic in babies not already suffering with it and they would not make the claim that it could prevent colic in the future.","The CAP Code stated that objective claims must be backed by evidence; if relevant, consisting of trials conducted on people. The ad stated “Expertly engineered to prevent colic, gas, and reflux … Even less gas … Even less stress … Even more sleep”. The ASA considered consumers would understand from this that the product could prevent colic and lessen the symptoms of colic, which included gassiness and reduced sleep. As such, in order to substantiate the claims, we considered that a substantive body of evidence was needed, consisting of clinical trials conducted on humans. We firstly acknowledged Tommee Tippee’s concession that they could not substantiate the claim that Colicsoothe prevented colic and welcomed their explanation that they would not be making that claim in the future. We also acknowledged the positive results outlined in the test by Tommee Tippee. However, the test had not been peer reviewed, did not use a control group, was not completed under test conditions, was small scale, relied on parents to self-record symptoms, and was conducted over only a six-day period. The data therefore was insufficiently robust to substantiate the claims that the product could prevent colic and lessen the symptoms of colic. For those reasons, we considered that the evidence provided by Tommee Tippee did not sufficiently substantiate the efficacy claims for the product. We therefore concluded that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained about.

The 45% off birthday promotion could be used against all products on the website apart from a small number of products which were excluded. Any products which were already discounted by more than 45% were available at that lower price to the complainant.

Below was an image of hiking boots with overlaying text which stated, “MONEY BACK 100% GUARANTEE”. b. The second ad featured the name “Eula K” next to five star symbols. Text below was the same testimonial as in ad (a). Below was an image of a person’s legs and feet next to a pair of shoes. Text overlaying the image stated “DOCTOR-RECOMMENDED SOLUTION FOR PLANTAR FASCIITIS … Reduced pressure points … Strengthens Foot Muscles … Natural Foot Movement”. At the bottom of the ad text stated, “Barefoot shoes for better health”. c. The third ad featured the name “Essie E.” next to five star symbols. Text below stated, “""Battling plantar fasciitis left me drained until I discovered these barefoot shoes, suggested by a friend. Their arch support and natural flexibility restored my vitality! The pain lessened, and I reclaimed the pleasure of walking. These shoes were my saving grace against plantar fasciitis. Eternal gratitude!"". Further text stated, “Enhanced Sensory Feedback … Reduced Pressure Points … Improved Circulation”. The ad featured a video of a man in a white doctor’s coat. His voice-over explained that HIKE footwear could improve foot pain and conditions such as neuropathy, plantar fasciitis, arthritis and bunions.","1. The complainant challenged whether the claim “100% MONEYBACK GUARANTEE” in ad (a) was misleading, because they had been unable to claim under the guarantee.The ASA challenged whether: 2. the ads made medical claims for unlicensed products; and 3. the testimonials in ads (a) and (b) were genuine.",Hike Future Ltd t/a HIKE Footwear said they had removed the ads and ensured they would not be published again. They explained they would review their advertising practices to prevent similar issues arising in future. They further said that they had no record of the customer requesting money back as part of their return policy. HIKE Footwear said that the testimonials in ads (a) and (b) were genuine reviews from their customers on their store and a review platform.,"1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not use the word ""guarantee"" in a way that could cause confusion about a consumer's rights and that marketers must promptly refund consumers who make valid claims under an advertised money-back guarantee. The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “100% MONEYBACK GUARANTEE” in ad (a) to mean that they could receive a full refund if they were not happy with the product. Because we received no evidence from HIKE Footwear that they honoured the guarantee, and the complainant provided information showing that they had contacted them numerous times enquiring how to return the product, we concluded that the claim “100% MONEYBACK GUARANTEE” was misleading. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 3.53, 3.54 and 3.55 (Guarantees and after-sales service). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated medicinal or medical claims and indications could only be made for a medicinal product that was licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. A medicinal claim was a claim that a product or its constituent(s) could be used with a view to making a medical diagnosis, or could treat or prevent disease, including an injury, ailment or adverse condition, whether of body or mind, in human beings. We understood that the products in ads (a), (b) and (c) were not registered with the MHRA as medical devices. We considered consumers would interpret the claims “Improved Circulation” and “I had almost given up hope when neuropathy took over my life, but these barefoot shoes have been a turning point! As I started wearing them, I noticed my balance gradually returning day by day. The numbness and tingling sensations became less frequent ...These shoes are more than just footwear; they're my path to recovery!”, in ad (a), as medical claims that the shoes could treat the conditions and symptoms listed. We further considered that consumers would interpret the claim “DOCTOR-RECOMMENDED SOLUTION FOR PLANTAR FASCIITIS”, in ad (b), as a medical claim that the shoes could treat that condition. Lastly, we considered consumers would also interpret the claims “These shoes were my saving grace against plantar fasciitis”, “Improved Circulation” and the voice-over that explained HIKE Footwear could improve foot pain and conditions such as neuropathy, plantar fasciitis, arthritis and bunions, in ad (c), as medical claims that the shoes could treat those conditions and symptoms.Because the ad made medical claims, it was therefore necessary for the product to meet the requirements for medical devices. However, as explained above, because we understood the product was not registered with the MHRA, nor had we seen any evidence that it had the applicable conformity marking, we therefore considered that no medical claims could be made for the product, and we concluded that the ads breached the Code.On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 3. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketers must hold documentary evidence that a testimonial or endorsement used in a marketing communication was genuine, unless it was obviously fictitious, and hold contact details for the person who gave it.We considered that consumers would interpret the testimonials in ads (a) and (b), which featured the names “Ivy K” and “Eula K”, as being genuine testimonials for the product. We acknowledged HIKE Footwear’s comment that the testimonials in ads (a) and (b) were authentic. However, we had not received any evidence that the testimonials were genuine or received any contact details for the people who gave them. Furthermore, the testimonials were exactly the same, despite being attributed to different people. We therefore concluded that they were misleading.On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.45 (Endorsements and testimonials).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Hike Future Ltd t/a HIKE Footwear to ensure that future ads did not claim there was a 100% money-back guarantee if not all valid refund requests were honoured. We told them not to make medical claims for products that did not have the applicable conformity marking and were not registered with the MHRA. Furthermore, they should not imply testimonials were genuine if that was not the case.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/hike-future-ltd-a24-1238532-hike-future-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Just Eat.co.uk Ltd t/a Just-Eat.co.uk,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Just Eat, seen on 15 December 2023, featured text that stated “Fancy a McMuffin in the morning? McNugget for lunch? Or a big night in with a Big Mac? Get them delivered right here”. Below that was a changing image of McNuggets that was replaced by the Just Eat and McDonald’s logos.",,"Just Eat.co.uk Ltd t/a Just Eat said McDonald’s determined the status of their products. However, they understood that the meat variants of the Big Mac and McMuffin were HFSS products. Just Eat targeted the ad at individuals aged over 18 years using Meta’s age targeting tools. They therefore highlighted that if the complainant had a Facebook account registered with an age of under 18, they would not have been able to see the ad at that time. Just Eat provided data obtained from Facebook which they said demonstrated that the ad had not been served to users who were registered as under-18 on the platform in December 2023. They confirmed that interest-based targeting had not been used as part of the targeting parameters for the ad. Just Eat were satisfied that the targeting of the ad was responsible.","Upheld The CAP Code required that HFSS product ads must not be directed at people under 16 years of age through the selection of media or the context in which they appeared. The ad referenced three types of McDonald’s products: McMuffins, McNuggets and a Big Mac. The ASA understood that the Big Mac was an HFSS product for the purposes of the Code. We also understood that there were six variations of the McMuffin, five of which contained meat, and that those meat McMuffins were also HFSS products for the purpose of the Code. The ad was therefore an HFSS product ad. CAP Guidance on age-restricted ads online stated that marketers should be able to demonstrate that they had taken all reasonable steps, including using all additional targeting tools available to them, to ensure that HFSS product ads were directed at an audience aged 16 and over to minimise children’s exposure to them. It also stated that targeting solely on the basis of age data was unlikely to satisfy the requirements of CAP’s media placement restrictions for age-restricted ads online because of younger users misreporting their age or different people sharing the same device. We acknowledged that age-based targeting was applied to the ad to exclude those who were registered as under-18 on Facebook from seeing the ad. However, interest-based targeting factors had not been used to exclude groups of people more likely to be under 16 from the target audience of the ad. The ad was a paid-for ad on Facebook; we understood that interest-based targeting measures were available for such ads, and consequently, we considered that Just Eat should have utilised those tools to minimise the exposure of the ad to under-16s. We concluded that Just Eat had not taken sufficient care to ensure that the ad, which promoted several HFSS products, was not directed at individuals aged under 16 years. The ad therefore breached the Code.The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 15.18 (HFSS product and placement).",The ad must not appear in its current form. We told Just Eat.co.uk Ltd t/a Just Eat to ensure they used appropriate targeting to ensure their ads that featured HFSS products were not directed at individuals under the age of 16 years.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/just-eat-co-uk-ltd-a23-1226571-just-eat-co-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Valterous Ltd t/a Therapie Clinic,"Summary of council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Ads seen on Thérapie Medical UK’s website and Instagram between March 2024 and May 2024: (a) A paid-for Instagram story ad, seen on 26 March 2024 stated, “Spring Mega SALE now on!” and “Up to 70% OFF Laser Hair Removal”. (b) A page on the advertiser’s website, seen in May 2024 stated, “UP TO 70% OFF LASER HAIR REMOVAL SUMMER SAVINGS”. The page contained a number of products with a “was” price and a current price.",Laser Clinics UK challenged whether: 1. the claim “Up to 70% off” in ads (a) and (b) was misleading as they understood that only a limited number of treatments were available with the discount of 70% off; and 2. the “was” prices used in ad (b) were misleading and capable of substantiation as they understood that the treatments had never been sold at the higher price.,"1. Valterous Ltd t/a Thérapie Medical UK said the “Up to 70% off” claim in ads (a) and (b) was intended to convey that various treatments were available at discounts ranging up to 70%. They used the phrase “up to” to ensure transparency to their customers, indicating that while some treatments were discounted by 70%, others were offered at different discounts, which was reflected on their website with the “was” and “now” pricing. They appreciated the CAP guidance stated that at least 10% of discounted services or items should be available at the “up to” price and they would take immediate action to align their advertising practices accordingly. 2. They said the “was” prices used in ad (b) reflected the recommended retail price (RRP) provided by each of their suppliers. The RRPs represented the standard pricing for the treatments within the market and they consistently used these figures to ensure transparency and alignment with industry norms. Due to the nature of their pricing strategy being collaboratively developed with their suppliers, they were unable to share historical pricing data, which they considered to be commercially sensitive. But they said that details of their pricing policies and practices could be found in the terms and conditions section of their website.","1. & 2. Upheld In relation to ads (a) and (b), the ASA considered that consumers were likely to understand from the claim “UP TO 70% OFF” that a number of treatments available for purchase on the Thérapie Medical UK website would be discounted, and that a significant proportion of those items would be discounted by 70%. We considered they would expect that treatments which were discounted, including those discounted by 70%, would have been distributed across the full range of treatment prices. However, we did not receive data to demonstrate that this was the case. Because we considered consumers were likely to expect that a significant proportion of treatments, distributed across the range, would be discounted at the claimed maximum, and that was not the case, we concluded that the claim “UP TO 70% OFF” in ads (a) and (b) had not been substantiated and was likely to be misleading. We acknowledged that Thérapie Medical UK intended the “was” prices in ad (b) to be RRPs. However, we considered that consumers were likely to understand the “was” prices to refer to the prices at which the treatments were usually sold by Thérapie Medical UK, rather than as RRPs. They would therefore expect the discount to represent a genuine saving against those usual selling prices. We did not receive any pricing history for the treatments from Thérapie Medical UK. We had, however, seen historical information which showed that between November 2023 and April 2024, the “discounted” pricing had never increased to the price that was stated to be the “was” or “full” price. Because Thérapie Medical UK had not provided any data to verify that the “was” prices were a genuine representation of the price at which the treatments were usually sold at the time the ad appeared, we concluded that the savings claims in ad (b) were misleading. On those points, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 and 3.22 (Prices).",The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Valterous Ltd t/a Thérapie Medical UK to ensure their future savings claims did not mislead and that they could demonstrate that the “was” prices represented usual selling prices. They should also only state “up to” if a significant proportion of items were reduced at the advertised maximum discount.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/valterous-ltd-a24-1247566-valterous-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Huel Ltd,,"Two paid-for Facebook ads for Huel: a. The first ad, seen on 18 February 2024, featured an image of Huel’s Daily Greens drink with text that stated “‘This is Huel’s best product’ Steven Bartlett”. The caption stated “Ever wondered what Steven Bartlett actually thinks of Huel’s Daily Greens? Well there you have it […]”. b. The second ad, seen on 19 March 2024, showed two videos side-by-side; one showed Steven Bartlett and the other showed a person looking at their mobile phone. Superimposed text between the videos stated “Is Huel actually nice?”. Bartlett stated, “This is the best product that Huel have released."" The ad then cut to video of the person looking at the phone, who stated, “I keep seeing this guy all over the internet talking about Huel"" while superimposed text stated “Responding to Steven Bartlett”. They then said, “So let’s give it a try” and a packet of Huel’s Daily Greens powder entered the shot. They were then shown preparing and drinking Huel’s Daily Greens, and stated, “Fair play, Steven, I see your point.” The caption stated “Steven Bartlett said it first […]”.","The complainants, who understood Steven Bartlett was a director at Huel Ltd, challenged whether the omission of his commercial interest in the company from the ads was misleading.","Huel Ltd confirmed Steven Bartlett was a director at the company. They said the ads appeared in the standard Facebook format and were identifiable as ads due to the use of Facebook’s “Sponsored” labelling features. Additionally, it was clear that Huel was the advertiser due to the presence of their logo, the blue tick that verified the Huel name, their website URL, and the ads’ content. Huel said that when celebrities endorsed products, consumers generally understood they did so in the context of a commercial relationship with the company behind the product. Consumers had no doubt about the existence of such commercial relationships when they saw the endorsement within a paid-for ad taken out by a company. This expectation then removed the need for the commercial relationship to be explicitly stated, and that this was the case regardless of the exact nature of the relationship. Huel said Steven Bartlett was a well-known celebrity, entrepreneur, and investor. He had appeared regularly on the BBC’s Dragon’s Den programme, had 3.5 million followers on Instagram, a podcast with 6 million subscribers, and had published a Sunday Times bestselling book. They said Bartlett had invested in Huel as he liked their products. Huel had announced this on their website and YouTube channel, and this had received coverage in the media.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information. Material information was information that the consumer needed to make informed decisions in relation to a product. The ASA considered the ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications and that Steven Bartlett would have been known to many consumers through his appearances as a “Dragon” on “Dragons’ Den” and his other business-related enterprises. We understood that on Dragons’ Den he provided opinions on businesses and did not invest in most of them. The ads appeared on Huel’s own Facebook account. Ad (a) stated “‘This is Huel’s best product’ Steven Bartlett”. Ad (b) included a clip of Steven Bartlett who stated, “This is the best product that Huel have released” and included an actor who said, “I keep seeing this guy all over the internet talking about Huel,” in reference to Bartlett, and “Fair play, Steven, I see your point”. We considered that many consumers would interpret the ads as featuring a testimonial from Steven Bartlett about one of Huel’s products. Steven Bartlett held a position as a director at Huel. We acknowledged Huel’s comments and agreed that some consumers might have thought that the ads were part of a commercial relationship with Steven Bartlett. However, many consumers were unlikely to understand from the ads that Steven Bartlett had a financial interest in Huel’s performance. We considered that Bartlett’s directorship was material to consumers’ understanding of the ads, and so relevant for them in making an informed decision about the advertised product. Because the ads omitted material information about Steven Bartlett’s position as a director at Huel, we concluded they were likely to mislead. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Huel Ltd to ensure that future ads did not misleadingly omit material information regarding commercial relationships.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/huel-ltd-g24-1237493-huel-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Quintain Living Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website for property management company Quintain Living, www.quintainliving.com, seen on 12 February. A page titled “7 WAYS YOU’LL SAVE WITH US” stated “SAVE ON AVERAGE 56% ON ENERGY BILLS. According to Amber Energy these energy savings are based on comparing our EPC rating of “B” versus the average rental property rating of “D” in England & Wales of comparable apartment size. Energy bills being defined as heating, lighting and hot water”. The page also stated “FREE SUPERFAST WIFI. Save £477 per year [“Save £477 per year” in bold] according to uSave – the average UK superfast broadband (30mbps or above) is £39.75/mth. Ours is included, set up ready to go and is 250mbps on all buildings except Alto, Montana & Dakota on 60mbps”. It further stated, “FREE WORK FROM HOME AREAS”.",The complainant challenged whether the following claims were misleading and could be substantiated:,,"The ASA considered consumers would understand the claim “SAVE ON AVERAGE 56% ON ENERGY BILLS”, which appeared beside explanatory text, to mean that they would save 56% on their energy costs against the average comparable energy bill by renting through Quintain Living. The ASA acknowledged Quintain Living’s statement that the claim had been inaccurate from April 2023 to April 2024, and we welcomed their willingness to amend it. However, we had not received any evidence to demonstrate that the claim that consumers could save 56% on average on energy bills was accurate when the ad was seen or previously. We therefore concluded that it was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). The CAP Code stated that marketers must not describe an element of a package as ""free"" if that element was included in the package price unless consumers were likely to regard it as an additional benefit because it had recently been added to the package without increasing its price. We considered consumers would understand the claim “FREE SUPERFAST WIFI” to mean that the WiFi was genuinely free and therefore not included in the rent payments or other charges. We acknowledged Quintain Living’s explanation that the WiFi was included in the package price and was therefore not technically “free”. Given that, we concluded that the claim “FREE SUPERFAST WIFI” was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.25 (Free). We considered consumers would understand the claim “FREE WORK FROM HOME AREAS” to mean that the areas were genuinely free and therefore not included in the rent payments or other charges. We acknowledged Quintain Living’s comment that there were some work-from-home areas which were available to all residents without a hire fee, and some higher quality options which could be hired for a cost. However, we understood that those work-from-home areas which did not require a hire fee were in any case included in the package cost. Given that those work-from-home areas were not therefore genuinely free, we concluded that the claim “FREE WORK FROM HOME AREAS” was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.25 (Free).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Quintain Living Ltd not to describe an element of a package as “free” if that element was included in the package price unless consumers were likely to regard it as an additional benefit because it had recently been added to the package without increasing its price.

ASA Ruling on The Edinburgh Herbal Dispensary Ltd t/a Napiers Edinburgh,This investigation forms part of a wider piece of work on ads making claims about the treatment of symptoms of the menopause. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA.,"Five TikTok ads for Napiers The Herbalists' Wild Yam Cream: (a) A TikTok ad on Kate Ring’s account @yourmategingerkate seen on 24 January 2024. The video in the ad featured on-screen text that stated, “Perimenopausal? Menopausal? Or post menopausal?”. Kate and on-screen text stated, “Where are my perimenopausal, my menopausal, and my post menopausal ladies at? Each to their own when it comes to HRT [hormone replacement therapy], that’s a choice and a decision that you need to make. However, before you go down that route, can you please just try a more natural way. I promise you it will be better for your long-term health. So with that said, Napiers Wild Yam Skin cream […] Essentially what this is, this is like hormone replacement cream that you put in areas of your body […] far far better than any pharmaceutical drugs you could take to balance hormones. Remember big pharma wasn’t always around and we did use plants and herbs and all of that woohoo stuff as medicine and guess what it worked.” Text under the video stated, “Commission paid”. (b) The first of two ads on Yiolanda’s (Yolly’s) account @lifestyle_and_smiles, seen on 17 February 2024, featured text that stated, “Wild yam cream to help my perimenopause journey & balance my hormones” and “Commission paid” at the bottom. An accompanying video had on-screen text that stated, “Wild yam cream to support perimenopause symptoms”. Yiolanda and on-screen text then stated, “As you may know if you follow me I am adding a symptom of the day when it comes to perimenopause and to help balance out hormones and to help me with all of those symptoms and I’m feeling so good right now even better since coming off of HRT over five months ago and that’s using the wild yam cream. So if you are having perimenopause symptoms if you are on HRT you can still use the wild yam cream but they do suggest that you speak to your doctor first. Although it’s a completely natural product. But if you’re not on HRT and you’d like to try something naturally to help balance out your hormones, it doesn’t add either oestrogen or progesterone, it works by balancing out or firing up our own. If our hormones are balanced then that means far less to maybe even no perimenopause symptoms and I’m having far less right now. In fact I’m in the best place I’ve been in such a long time and there’s a flash sale right now.” (c) The second ad on the same page, seen on 1 March 2024, featured on-screen text that stated, “Wild yam cream flash sale…. Commission paid”. An accompanying video had on-screen text that stated, “My perimenopause symptoms are balanced using the wild yam cream. Flash sale. Wild yam cream”. Yiolanda and on-screen text then stated, “There’s a flash sale on the wild yam cream right now so if you are looking to try it it’s a really good time to give it a go. I’ve linked it below for you if you’re already using it and loving it then also it’s a great time for you to stock up. I’ve been using this for almost six months now helping balance out my hormones, my oestrogen and progesterone since I came off HRT and I am feeling so balanced. No night sweats, no fatigue, no brain fog, no body aches, no anxiety, no rage, they were really my main symptoms I would say and I’m feeling in a really good place. I use it every single day and then I break for up to seven days when my period arrives. A pea size just upper arm or inner thigh [sic]. If you’re no longer having periods you do not need to break but you can take a break if you want to and you can use it up to three times a day but start slow”. (d) The first of two ads on Michelle Haslam’s account @michelle.haslam, seen on 12 March 2024, featured on-screen text that stated, “How long have you been suffering from perminopausal [sic] hot sweats?”. A text bubble on-screen stated, “Reply to Lottie’s comment” and included the following text, “I’ve been suffering for ages and this is the best thing I’ve used. My hot flushes have improved so much. This is 100% better than anything. It may have just saved my sanity”. Michelle and on-screen text in the video stated, “I absolutely hate hearing that women have suffered for so long with perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms. Lottie’s been using the wild yam cream and has had an amazing result […] I’ve been using this now for just under two months and I still have absolutely loads left […] it’s having a massive effect on me, my rage and it’s not helping my insomnia at all but it’s helping my rage, my anxiety, I don’t really have that anymore and it’s helping Lottie with her hot flushes and yeah I just absolutely love this stuff. I’ve linked it below […] it’s amazing and no it doesn’t work for everybody okay, I am not saying it will work for everyone there are people in my comments that it doesn’t work for but for those it does it’s life changing.” Text at the bottom of the post said, “Commission paid”. (e) The second ad on the same page, seen on 16 March 2024, featured text that stated, “[…] Perimenopaise [sic] symptoms are all going for lots of people in my comments. Rage, anxiety, night sweats and they’re sleeping better. #yamcreamforperimenopause #napierswildyamcream #wildyamcream”. On-screen text stated, “Wild yam cream flash sale Sat 16 March 10am – 1pm For perimenopausal symptoms”. A text bubble on-screen stated, “Reply to Susan Cropper’s comment” and included the following text, “Amazing 2 weeks in. No night sweats at all. Sleeping better x”. Michelle and on-screen text in the video stated, “If you’re lucky enough to be seeing this on Sat 16 of March between 10:00am and one pm you can get the Napiers wild yam cream on flash sale. People in my comments have been getting rid of night sweats, they’re sleeping better, their rage is going, anxiety is going, some people are coming off of HRT completely. So this is an absolutely incredible time to stock up for a few months, grab it while you can.” Text at the bottom of the post said, “Commission paid”.",The ASA challenged whether the ads made medicinal claims for an unlicensed product.,"The Edinburgh Herbal Dispensary Ltd t/a Napiers The Herbalists said they were committed to being compliant with advertising regulation. They said their product, Napiers Wild Yam Cream, was not intended to cure or treat any disease, injury, ailment, or adverse condition, whether of body or mind, as set out by the CAP Code, and therefore, no licensing was required under authorisation from the MHRA. They said it was not accurate to classify the perimenopause as a medical condition and it was not treated that way by the World Health Organization (WHO). The TikTok creators used the word “symptoms” to describe their experience of using Napiers Wild Yam Cream, which was in line with the WHO, who said that “Although menopause is not a disease … the perimenopausal and postmenopausal experiences of women [are referred to], as symptoms because they can result in a level of discomfort that affects their quality of life”. They said it would be in disagreement with the WHO, general definitions relating to the menopause, and language surrounding the descriptions of women’s experiences, to classify perimenopause or menopause as medical conditions, or the claims as medicinal. They strongly supported the ability of women experiencing perimenopause and menopause to discuss their experiences in an open way on platforms where their voices could be heard. They were concerned that restricting such language would have an adverse effect, particularly for those advocating for the normalisation of the discussion and sharing advice based on their personal experiences. They said that all the ads had been removed and the content had not been used in any other advertising by Napiers The Herbalists. They said they would ensure that content relating to the brand and all of their products was compliant in future. Yiolanda Koppel said she was passionate about supporting women going through the perimenopause and believed she had not made medical claims about Napiers Wild Yam Cream on her TikTok account. She said the perimenopause was not a disease and that not everyone took or wanted to take HRT. She believed TikTok was a place to share her experience of the perimenopause and she had used Napiers Wild Yam Cream to support her perimenopause journey since she had stopped taking HRT. Kate Ring said she took the CAP Code seriously and that her commercial content did not have the intention of promoting products with medicinal claims. She apologised if her content broke guidelines and said she was not aware the menopause was a medical term. She considered it to be a stage in a woman’s life, rather than an actual diagnosis. She said she would be more mindful with her content going forward and that she had removed the ad from her TikTok account. Michelle Haslam said her content was not meant to constitute medical advice. Her intention was to describe her own experience of using Napiers Wild Yam Cream, and to share feedback from other users of the product. She also said she took the CAP Code seriously and that her commercial content did not have the intention of promoting any product with medicinal claims. She confirmed the ads had been removed from her TikTok account.","The CAP Code (which reflected legislation) stated that medicinal or medical claims and indications may be made for a medicinal product that was licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency, or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. A medicinal claim was defined by legislation as a claim that a product or its constituent(s) could be used with a view to making a medical diagnosis or could treat or prevent disease, including an injury, ailment or adverse condition, whether of body or mind, in human beings. The ASA considered that consumers were likely to understand the claims in ads (b), (c), (d), and (e), “support perimenopause symptoms”, “balance out hormones”, and the claims the product could treat sufferers of night sweats, poor sleep, hot flushes, fatigue, brain fog, body aches, anxiety, and rage, to mean that Napiers Wild Yam Cream could treat the symptoms of the perimenopause and menopause. Similarly, we considered the claims in ad (a), “Each to their own when it comes to HRT. However […] can you please just try a more natural way”, “This is like hormone replacement cream that you put on areas of your body. Far better than any pharmaceutical drugs you could take to balance hormones”, and in ad (e), “some people are coming off of HRT completely”, were likely to be understood as referring to treatment for perimenopause and menopause symptoms. We considered claims regarding the treatment and management of adverse symptoms of perimenopause and menopause were medicinal claims for the purposes of the legislation reflected in the Code. As such, the product was required to be licensed as a medicine in order to allow such claims. However, we understood that the product did not have the relevant marketing authorisation from the MHRA and because of that no medicinal claims could be made for the product.

ASA Ruling on ZOE Ltd,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for healthcare company Zoe, seen on 26 February 2024, featured an image of Steven Bartlett with a patch on his arm which contained the text “Zoe”. Text overlaying the image was a quote by Steven Bartlett which stated, “If you haven’t tried ZOE yet, give it a shot. It might just change your life.” Text below this stated “STEVEN BARTLETT”.","Two complainants, who understood Steven Bartlett was an investor in Zoe, challenged whether the omission of his commercial interest in the company from the ad was misleading.","Zoe Ltd told us that Steven Bartlett was a well-known entrepreneur, investor, speaker, author, podcast host and television personality. He was familiar to many as a “Dragon” from the popular BBC One television series “Dragon’s Den”. He also published the best-selling book “The Diary of a CEO - 33 Laws for Business and Life” and hosted the podcast “The Diary of a CEO”. Zoe further told us that when a well-known personality or celebrity appeared in advertising for a brand, the average consumer would understand that there was a commercial relationship between the brand and the individual and did not need to know the exact nature of that relationship. They would also typically assume that the individual had been paid to appear in the advertising, whether in the form of a one-off fee or as part of a longer-running association. They said that since the post was obviously identifiable as an ad, then it was unclear exactly how the average consumer was misled by the omission of any additional information identifying the precise nature of Steven Bartlett’s commercial relationship with the company. The average consumer understood that Steven Bartlett was appearing in the ad in connection with a commercial relationship with Zoe and that his participation in the advertising earned him some financial reward. Zoe highlighted several prominent celebrities who had commercial relationships with well-known brands. Zoe said that if they were obliged to include a specific disclosure about the nature of Steven Bartlett’s status as an investor in Zoe, this would have a wider impact on other brands and influencers. They believed it undermined the principle that ads on owned media are usually obviously identifiable as advertising and that “#Ad” was sufficient enough to make influencer advertising obviously identifiable as advertising.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information, which was information that the consumer needed to make informed decisions in relation to a product. The ASA acknowledged that the post was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication and Steven Bartlett was known to many through his role as a “Dragon” on “Dragons’ Den” and his other business-related enterprises. We understood that on Dragons’ Den he provided opinions on businesses and did not invest in most of them. We considered that many consumers would interpret the ad as featuring a testimonial from Stephen Bartlett about the product provided by Zoe. We considered the phrasing “give it a shot”, “It might just change your life”, and “STEVEN BARTLETT” below the quote, which was reminiscent of how a customer might review a product, and of how an independent testimonial might be presented in an ad, emphasised that impression. Steven Bartlett was an investor in Zoe, which we considered was material to consumers’ understanding of the ad and relevant in making an informed decision about the product. Because the ad omitted material information about Steven Bartlett being an investor in Zoe, we concluded that it was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained about.

ASA Ruling on Flow Neuroscience AB t/a Flow,,"An Instagram post by the TV personality Gemma Collins, @gemmacollins, seen on 22 May 2023, featured a video of Gemma wearing a device. She said, “I am one week into using my Flow Neuroscience device. When I tell you it is amazing – it is literally amazing. Even after one week of use I’m feeling lighter, I’m feeling brighter, I am loving life now I’m off of [sic] my depression tablets and this has been a real game changer for me […] Flow is a new medically approved depression treatment. It focuses on the front cortex of your brain. This ultimately helps you to relax and it also removes negative depressive symptoms. For people that can’t get access to therapy or don’t want to be on antidepressants, they now have a new option, which is Flow. Flow actually works faster and better than antidepressants […] It’s like having your own therapist in the comfort of your own home […] You’re fully in control of your own treatment. You can buy Flow on the Flow Neuroscience website. They even have a money back guarantee, so you can test it and if it doesn’t work for you, you can 100 percent get your money back. I was never relaxed, I was always 100 miles an hour, constantly, like, stressing, and now I am just chill to the bone. Literally, Flow genuinely helps with any daily depressive niggles that I might get […] It will be the best thing that you ever do.” The accompanying text stated “I’ve been using the @flowneuroscience headset for a week, and I have noticed a real difference in how I’m feeling. According to Flow’s data it reduces depression in 88% of people. And the NHS are trialling it too. Why not give it a go if you’re struggling with your mental health […] consult your GP always without fail and do not stop taking your medication before consulting your GP.”","The complainant challenged whether the ad discouraged essential treatment for a condition for which medical supervision should be sought, including by suggesting Flow as an alternative to antidepressants.","Flow Neuroscience AB t/a Flow said transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was a non-invasive and non-pharmacological form of brain stimulation, which was used as a treatment option for depression, as well as other psychological disorders.They accepted that medical supervision should always be sought for depression and that it needed to be treated responsibly. They said the ad displayed a clear message for viewers to first speak to their GP before thinking about trying the Flow service or changing their medication. While the content was clearly a reflection of Gemma Collins’ personal experience, which Flow could not dictate, at no point did Gemma recommend that viewers should not consult a medical professional. They said people experienced depression in many different ways and that it had many possible causes, but that most people were prescribed the same treatments: talking therapy and medication, which did not work for everyone. Flow said Gemma spoke specifically about her own experience of how Flow had helped her reduce her consumption of antidepressants. They maintained that it was common in influencer marketing for a product to be represented based on the influencer’s personal experience; they were not able to adjust or manipulate a user’s genuine testimonial. They said, although they disagreed that the ad was irresponsible, they had requested that it be removed from Instagram, and that Gemma Collins had confirmed that she had done so. Gemma Collins endorsed Flow’s comments. She said the fact that the ad stated to consult your GP “without fail” sent a very clear message. She believed the ad contained only personal observations and proven evidence and did not contain persuasive language. The ad did not discourage essential treatment but, rather, flagged an alternative or supplementary one. She believed that there was nothing irresponsible in expressing that Flow could be used as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, antidepressants. She said she had stopped using her antidepressant tablets a long time before starting to use Flow and that her stopping was in no way linked to Flow.Instagram said they had no comments on the complaint, but if the complainant believed the ad was in violation of their policies, they could report it to them via their standard reporting channels.","The ASA acknowledged that Flow provided documentation which they maintained supported the efficacy and treatment claims made in the ad. However, the ASA’s ruling was limited to whether the ad discouraged essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. The ASA did not formally consider or rule on whether the evidence did or did not substantiate the effectiveness of the device. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketers must not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. For example, they must not offer specific advice on, diagnosis of or treatment for such conditions unless that advice, diagnosis or treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified health professional. The ad referred to depression, which was a condition for which medical supervision must be sought, and therefore (regardless of any evidence to substantiate the effectiveness of the device) advice, diagnosis or treatment needed to be conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. The ad stated “I am one week into using my Flow Neuroscience device […] I’m feeling lighter, I’m feeling brighter, I am loving life now I’m off of [sic] my depression tablets and this has been a real game changer for me […]”. The ASA acknowledged that Ms Collins maintained she had stopped taking antidepressants before starting to use Flow. We considered, however, that the implication was that people who started to use the device would be able to stop their medication shortly after and without medical supervision. We also considered that the claims in the video “Why not give it a go if you’re struggling with your mental health?”, “If you don’t have access to therapy or don’t want to be on antidepressants” and “you’re fully in control of your own treatment” suggested that the device could be used as an alternative to conventional treatment. In particular, “you’re fully in control of your own treatment” implied that the device could be used at home and that medical supervision was not needed at any stage. “If you don’t have access to therapy” further suggested that consumers could avoid consulting a professional. We considered that the reference to buying the device directly from the website added to the impression that consumers could bypass the medical consultation route. The device was intended for home use and could be purchased by anyone over the age of 18. Therefore, consumers were able to undertake treatment without consulting a medical professional and could use the device at home without their treatment being monitored. We considered that the claims were targeted at both those consumers who were weighing up treatment options at an early point in their illness and those who were currently receiving conventional medication or therapy for depression. In addition to Gemma Collins’ video presentation, the ad included text in the caption which made further efficacy and treatment claims. We acknowledged that, at the end of that caption, text stated “consult your GP always without fail and do not stop taking your medication before consulting your GP”. However, we considered that this text did no more than suggest that consumers should arrange a consultation with a GP before starting to use the device. The Code required that treatment for depression should be conducted under medical supervision. We considered that a preliminary consultation, which consumers were free to not go ahead with, did not meet the requirement for ongoing supervision, particularly in the context of an ad which presented the device as an immediate alternative to conventional treatments associated with treating depression, such as antidepressants or therapy, which might be complex and potentially longer term, as well as presenting the device as being for home use, without any initial or ongoing monitoring or supervision by a medical professional. We therefore considered that the text in the caption indicating that a GP should be consulted was insufficient to satisfy the requirement of the Code that ads must not offer treatment for depression unless that treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified health professional.In addition to the potential risks of not seeking medical advice before starting treatment for depression, the NHS website stated that it was not recommended to discontinue antidepressant use without supervision by a medical professional because of the potentially serious physical and mental side effects. We considered that the ad trivialised the decision to come off antidepressants or not take them at all and encouraged people to take their treatment into their own hands. We concluded that the ad discouraged essential treatment for a condition for which medical supervision should be sought and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.2 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Flow Neuroscience AB t/a Flow to ensure their future ads did not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought, including depression.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/flow-neuroscience-ab-a23-1200478-flow-neuroscience-ab.html
ASA Ruling on MedTech Global LLP t/a Orthoback,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website and paid-for Facebook ad for footwear company Orthoback: a. The website https://orthoback.com/, seen on 28 March, featured a page titled “Everyday Shoe” which contained an image of black shoes with the text “… ORTHOSHOES [registered trademark symbol after “ORTHOSHOES”] EasyWalk Pro - Ergonomic Pain Relief Shoe … SAVE £74.85 £49.90 £124.75 [strike through “£124.75”]. Further text at the top of the page stated, “Easy Returns”. Text at the bottom of the page stated “100% Satisfaction Guarantee. Not satisfied? Take advantage of our money-back guarantee … 30-Day Exchange Policy. Easily exchange your goods within 30 days”. The FAQ page stated “Service, Returns & Exchanges. What is your return policy? If you are dissatisfied with your order or have noticed any quality issues, please contact our customer support within 30 days to initiate a smooth return or exchange process”. b. The Facebook ad, seen on 17 April, featured the text “Here are your benefits when purchasing the EasyWalk Pro: Arch support relieves foot & heel pain, Cushioned sole eases back & knee stress, Ergonomic design enhances gait & posture, Flexible Toe Box provides spaces”. The ad featured a video which started with a man in a white coat and overlaying text which stated “GEOFFREY WILLIAMS, ORTHOPEDIST FOR 35 YEARS”. Voice-over then stated “No woman with foot pain leaves my practice without these shoes. The orthopaedic Easywalk pro Shoes by Orthoback relieve pressure points on the soles of the feet and actively alleviate pain … pain-free shoes that look sporty rather than medicinal … particularly helpful for plantar fasciitis, arthritis, ankle pain, and swelling … these shoes correct foot posture.”","The ASA received two complaints: 1. One complainant, who believed the product was never sold for £124.75, challenged whether ad (a) was misleading. 2. One complainant, who found there were various conditions to making a return, challenged whether the claims “Easy Returns” and “Take advantage of our money-back guarantee” in ad (a) were misleading. 3. One of the complainants also challenged whether ad (b) made medical claims which breached the Code.",,"The ASA was concerned by Orthoback’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code 1.7 (Edition 12) rule (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. 1 Upheld Ad (a) stated “EasyWalk Pro - Ergonomic Pain Relief Shoe … SAVE £74.85, £49.90 £124.75 [strike through “£124.75”]”. We considered that consumers would understand from the price claim that the usual selling price of the product was £124.75 and therefore that a genuine saving of £74.85 could be made.The ASA had received no evidence from Orthoback that the higher price stated was the usual selling price. We therefore concluded that the savings claim in ad (a) was misleading.On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (Prices). 2 Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not use the word ""guarantee"" in a way that could cause confusion about a consumer's rights and marketers must promptly refund consumers who make valid claims under an advertised money-back guarantee. Ad (a) included the claims “Easy Returns” and “Take advantage of our money-back guarantee”. We considered that consumers would understand from this that they could readily claim a full refund if they returned the purchased product in line with the advertised guarantee. However, the complainant confirmed that when they had contacted Orthoback for a refund, they were offered a 50% discount and told to keep the shoes. The complainant further told us that no return address was made available to enable them to return the product. We also received no information from Orthoback that demonstrated that consumers were routinely refunded as claimed when making returns. In addition, the “Refund policy” page of the website included the text “Please note, as per our policy, a restocking and refurbishment fee of £9 will be deducted from your refund”, which we considered misleadingly contradicted the impression that a full refund was available. For those reasons, we concluded that the claims “Easy Returns” and “Take advantage of our money-back guarantee” in ad (a) were misleading.On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.53 and 3.55 (Guarantees and after-sales service). 3 Upheld The Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) required that a medical device was registered with them before it was placed on the market in Great Britain. The ASA understood that the product was not registered with the MHRA as a medical device. The CAP Code stated medicinal or medical claims and indications were made only for a medicinal product that was licensed by the MHRA, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking.We considered consumers were likely to interpret the claims in ad (b) “particularly helpful for plantar fasciitis, arthritis, ankle pain … these shoes correct foot posture” as medical claims that the shoes could treat the symptoms and conditions listed. Because the ad made medical claims, it was therefore necessary for the product to meet the requirements for a medical device. However, because we had received no evidence that the product was registered with the MHRA, nor had we seen any evidence that it had the applicable conformity marking, we therefore considered that medical claims could not be made for the product. Because the ad made medical claims, we concluded that it breached the Code.On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told MedTech Global LLP t/a Orthoback to ensure that future ads did not make savings claims unless they were genuine. We further told them not to claim there were easy returns or a money-back guarantee if not all valid refund requests were honoured or if deductions were routinely made. Furthermore, they should not make medical claims for products that did not have the applicable conformity marking and were not registered with the MHRA.

ASA Ruling on Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd t/a Virgin Atlantic,,"A radio ad for Virgin Atlantic, heard on 24 November 2023, stated, “On the 28th of November, Virgin Atlantic’s Flight 100 will take to the skies on our unique flight mission from London Heathrow to JFK to become the world’s first commercial airline to fly transatlantic on 100% sustainable aviation fuel. When they said it was too difficult, we said: challenge accepted. Virgin Atlantic Flight 100. See the world differently.”",,"Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd t/a Virgin Atlantic explained that the background to the flight referenced in the ad was that in December 2022 they were announced as the winner of a competition run by the UK Department for Transport (DfT) to “support industry to achieve the first net zero transatlantic flight on an aircraft using 100% sustainable aviation fuel within one year”. The aim was to build on previous research and to further the understanding of the technical and operational feasibility of using 100% sustainable aviation fuel in a commercial passenger aircraft. The standards currently in place allowed only for a maximum of 50% sustainable aviation fuel to be used, blended with fossil derived fuel. Flight 100 demonstrated that sustainable aviation fuel could be used as a full replacement for fossil derived jet fuel in existing aircraft, supported by existing fuel infrastructure. Virgin said that an element of their competition bid to the DfT was the intention that the flight would improve transparency and understanding around sustainable aviation fuel and its environmental impacts for both the wider industry and the public. Virgin Atlantic emphasised that the ad’s wording “… become the world’s first commercial airline to fly transatlantic, on 100% sustainable aviation fuel” mirrored the terms used by the DfT in its competition invitation, as quoted above. They believed consumers would understand the term “100% sustainable aviation fuel” in the context of the ad to be a reference to a type of fuel which was made from sustainable sources, rather than being fossil fuel based, and which reduced but did not necessarily completely eliminate greenhouse gases. They did not think listeners would understand the ad to mean that the fuel used for Flight 100 was derived from completely sustainable sources, did not generate CO2 or other emissions that had an adverse environmental impact during use, and that over its full lifecycle had no adverse environmental impacts. The ad did not claim that the fuel was 100% sustainable, nor did it give a misleading impression about the absolute or relative environmental nature, impact or credentials of sustainable aviation fuel (as compared to other aviation fuel). Rather, it factually described how the flight was powered exclusively by sustainable aviation fuel. They referred to a survey they had undertaken, after receiving notification from the ASA about the complaint, to see what people understood from the ad. They said the key outcomes were that: overall, listeners considered it was easy to understand; the majority understood that the claim related to the proportion of sustainable aviation fuel used; and the majority (68%) understood from the ad that sustainable aviation fuel was better for the environment than traditional jet fuel, but that it was not without any adverse impact. They said the ASA recognised that most consumers understood aviation’s carbon emissions due to fossil fuel use and that they would infer that “sustainable aviation fuel” had a lesser environmental impact. They therefore believed the ad did not omit or present information unclearly, because the ad accurately stated that Flight 100 was powered solely by sustainable aviation fuel. They said that even if relevant information had been omitted from the ad, it was not ‘material’ information as referenced in the Code: that was information that consumers needed in context to make informed decisions about whether or how to buy a product or service. The ad did not advertise Virgin Atlantic’s products or services. It was instead showcasing a one-off research and development flight that did not operate as a normal commercial service. It therefore could not be said to lack any information that was necessary (rather than information that would assist, or be relevant) to enable the average consumer to take an informed transactional decision. They said that in any event, a further survey they had conducted since receiving notification from the ASA identified that sustainability factors influenced only around 1.5% of consumer’s overall choice about long-haul airlines. They said the term “sustainable aviation fuel” was used universally by governments, regulators, industry bodies, fuel companies, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), airlines, academia, aircraft and engine manufacturers and mainstream media. The ad therefore accurately referred to the type of fuel by its universally recognised and used definition. The term was used for synthetic aviation fuel that was not derived from fossil fuel. It encompassed fuel made from waste or renewable feedstocks. There were various feedstock sources and technology pathways that could be deployed to produce it. Differing criteria for sustainable aviation fuel existed, but the most widely used was the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) sustainability criteria established by the ICAO, a United Nations agency. The primary criteria were: (1) greenhouse gas reductions of at least 10% compared to the baseline lifecycle emissions values for aviation fuel on a lifecycle basis; (2) the fuel was not made from biomass obtained from land-aquatic systems with a high biogenic carbon stock; and (3) emissions reductions attributed to CORSIA sustainable aviation fuel should be permanent. Sustainable aviation fuel was certified by independent certification entities. The most common certifications were issued by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) and Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB). Methodologies to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas savings of sustainable aviation fuel compared to conventional fossil derived fuels were in accordance with those stipulated by the UK government, the European Union and industry bodies. They compared the greenhouse gas lifecycle emissions of biofuel sources to the extraction and processing of raw fossil feedstocks into crude oil and subsequent refinement into fossil jet fuel. The methodological approach was not specific to aviation, and full lifecycle assessments were used globally and across industry to establish baseline emissions and reductions from alternatives to fossil derived fuels. Virgin Atlantic said that under current fuel standards it was not permissible to blend different types of sustainable aviation fuels together, but they had received permission to do so for Flight 100, which combined two types. The first, Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK), was made using waste oils and lipids from animal fats. Those animal fats were deemed unfit for human consumption, and so converting them into biofuels represented the only viable means of reusing an otherwise wasted resource. SPK comprised 87.6% of the fuel used for Flight 100. The lifecycle emissions for the SPK were calculated in compliance with the relevant EU Renewable Energy Directive and ISCC methodologies. The other 12.4% of the fuel mix was comprised of Synthesised Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), a synthetic fuel derived from dextrose. It used sugars from isolated industrial corn starch, with the remaining portion of the corn’s oil, protein and fibre remaining available for the feed and food supply chains. SAK was at a developmental stage and was being produced in extremely small volumes until it had achieved approval under the International Standard which certified the safety of jet fuel. Once the fuel had achieved that certification a second process would be triggered for the manufacturing plant to be certified as CORSIA compliant. In the meantime, the methodology used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for SAK was the methodology required under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which was consistent with industry standards for the production of bio-based fuels. Prior to the flight, a consultancy firm calculated the carbon emissions across the full lifecycle of a Virgin Atlantic flight using traditional jet fuel, on the same route and aircraft type as Flight 100. It indicated that 97% of the greenhouse gas emissions generated were derived from fuel use. Virgin Atlantic confirmed that sustainable aviation fuel produced the same level of CO2 emissions during flight as traditional jet fuel. However, because sustainable aviation fuel utilised carbon that had recently been captured from the atmosphere, the CO2 savings were relative to a net increase in atmospheric carbon that would have been emitted had fossil fuels been dug up and used. Additional savings could also be realised through a reduction in lifecycle emissions from extraction, processing, manufacturing, transportation of the fuel, and through improving operational efficiencies. Flight 100 had trialled various operational efficiencies, including fuel burn efficiencies. Overall, Flight 100 had delivered a lifecycle CO2 emissions saving of 64%. The deployment of sustainable aviation fuel therefore represented a significant reduction in emissions.In addition, Flight 100’s fuel produced around 40% lower non-CO2 emissions (particulates such as water, sulphur oxides, soot and nitrous oxides) compared to fossil derived fuels. They had also mitigated for the potential that Flight 100 would result in contrail formation, but on the day relevant software had indicated there was no likelihood of that happening. Finally, Virgin Atlantic would purchase carbon removal credits to mitigate the residual CO2 from Flight 100. Radiocentre took advice from an independent external consultant, who said that “sustainable aviation fuel” was defined by the UK Government under the renewable transport fuel obligation. Radiocentre noted that the term was used by the World Economic Forum, International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the DfT to describe that category of aviation fuel. They were advised that commercial aircraft were already approved to use sustainable aviation fuel up to a maximum blend of 50% with conventional jet fuel, although typical blend rates were at between 10% and 30%.Radiocentre also considered the broader implications of the services being described as “sustainable”, and were careful to ensure the ad did not make or imply such a claim for the airline’s service. Instead, the ad focused solely on Virgin Atlantic’s claim that Flight 100 was the first commercial transatlantic flight to be powered only by sustainable aviation fuel.","Upheld The BCAP Code stated that unqualified claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. The meaning of all terms used in ads must be clear to consumers. The ASA considered that while many listeners would understand from the ad that Flight 100 had, uniquely, flown transatlantic using only sustainable aviation fuel, a significant proportion would understand the claim “100% sustainable aviation fuel” to mean that the fuel used was 100% sustainable. We understood that the term sustainable aviation fuel was widely used in the aviation industry and by governmental and other bodies to refer to biofuels and synthetic fuels – fuels which were not from fossil derived sources – and which had reduced impacts on the environment based on their resourcing and lifecycle emissions, compared to fossil derived aviation fuel. We considered most consumers were likely to be aware that aviation was a high carbon-emitting sector, due largely to its use of fossil derived aviation fuels, and would understand from the term sustainable aviation fuel that it had a less harmful impact on the environment than fossil derived aviation fuels. However, they were unlikely to be aware of the extent to which fuels described as sustainable aviation fuel still had negative environmental impacts, and in what ways. Those listeners who interpreted the claim “100% sustainable aviation fuel” to mean that the fuel was 100% sustainable were likely to expect that it had no negative environmental impacts at all. We considered the consumer opinion survey Virgin had commissioned confirmed the limited knowledge and lack of clarity amongst consumers about the environmental impact of sustainable aviation fuel, both in general and specifically after listening to the ad. While 68% of respondents said they understood from the ad that sustainable aviation fuel was “significantly” or “somewhat” better for the environment than traditional jet fuel, a further 15% understood it had the same impact as jet fuel, and 6% understood it was “somewhat” or “significantly” worse for the environment; 11% understood that sustainable aviation fuel had zero environmental impact. There were therefore significant minorities of respondents who did not have an accurate understanding of the environmental impact of sustainable aviation fuel after listening to the ad. Additionally, in response to a further true/false question, roughly 30% of respondents believed a statement that sustainable aviation fuel had “zero impact on the environment” was true. A significant number of respondents therefore responded differently than they had to the previous question, which we considered further indicated consumers’ confusion. We acknowledged that the specific sustainable aviation fuel mix used for Flight 100 was calculated to have delivered savings of 64% in greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil derived aviation fuel over its full lifecycle, but that was not stated in the ad. Additionally, while that was a significant reduction, we nonetheless understood that sustainable aviation fuel still produced significant emissions over its lifecycle. This included significant CO2, nitrous oxide and other climate-impacting emissions during flight, and that its production was not without other potentially negative environmental impacts in the longer term. For example, this included the diversion of biofuels from other sectors which might then revert back to fossil derived fuels, and the impact of land use changes, both direct and indirect. We therefore considered that in the absence of information in the ad which explained that sustainable aviation fuel produced reduced, but still significant, emissions over its full lifecycle, including in-flight emissions, and which explained the ways in which the fuel otherwise significantly adversely impacted the environment, a significant proportion of listeners were likely to overestimate its environmental benefits. We acknowledged the ad specifically highlighted Flight 100, which was a non-commercial flight for which listeners could not purchase tickets. However, it had the effect of building the overall impression that Virgin Atlantic was committed to taking on a challenging, pioneering and continuing role in working towards reducing the environmental impact of aviation. We considered many listeners would be interested in seeking out airlines that were taking such action. The ad specifically highlighted the use of sustainable aviation fuel in Flight 100; a method by which a reduction in environmental impact could be achieved. We therefore considered that information about its limitations in that regard constituted material information that would have an impact on the transactional decisions of those listeners. We therefore concluded that the unqualified claim “100% sustainable aviation fuel” was misleading. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 and 3.2 (Misleading advertising), 9.2, 9.3, and 9.5 (Environmental claims).",We told Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd t/a Virgin Atlantic to ensure that future ads which referred to the use of sustainable aviation fuel included qualifying information which explained the environmental impact of the fuel.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/virgin-atlantic-airways-ltd-g23-1224417-virgin-atlantic-airways-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Debenhams Brands Ltd t/a Debenhams,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Debenhams, seen on 9 March 2024, featured text that stated “Step into Spring with up to 60% off fashion, home and beauty at Debenhams”. Below, a carousel of images featuring different products were shown next to text stating “UP TO 60% OFF ” and a “Shop now” link.","The complainant, who understood that not all products featured in the ad were available at the advertised discounted price, challenged whether the claim “UP TO 60% OFF” was misleading and could be substantiated.","Debenhams Brands Ltd explained third-party suppliers decided whether to participate in a promotion, and as such, it was beyond their control if those partners chose to exclude certain products from a Debenhams promotion. In addition, because the products featured were from third-party suppliers, who controlled their own pricing due to legal reasons, Debenhams said they were unable to obtain the relevant sales data. However, since the complaint had been made, they said that the relevant team had been notified of the complaint and their internal processes had been revised to ensure future compliance with the CAP Code.","The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “Step into spring with up to 60% off fashion, home and beauty” alongside a carousel of images featuring three different products and further text that stated “UP TO 60% OFF” to mean that those products featured in the ad were explicitly included in the promotion, and would therefore be discounted by up to 60%. We did not receive the pricing history for any of the products from Debenhams and, therefore, we could not determine the usual selling price of the products featured in the ad. However, we noted that in screenshots of the three product listings shared by the complainant at the time the ad was seen, only one of the three product listings appeared to have a promotional price applied. This was demonstrated by a crossed-out reference price, alongside a lower promotional price, and the text “Save 60%”. The other two product listings included no such information and presented only one price, with no indication of having been reduced in price. Because we had not seen evidence that those products were available at the advertised promotional discount, we considered the use of the claim alongside those product images was misleading. Furthermore, whilst we acknowledged that the promotion appeared to have been applied to one of the products featured in the ad, because Debenhams had not provided any sales data to verify that the product had been sold at the advertised higher reference price, we were unable to determine the price at which the product was generally sold. We therefore considered they had not demonstrated that the savings claim represented a genuine saving against the usual selling price of the item. For those reasons, we considered the ad was misleading and concluded it had breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (prices).",The ad must not appear in the form complained of. We told Debenhams Brands Ltd to ensure that their future savings claims did not mislead and were substantiated against the usual selling price of the products.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/debenhams-brands-ltd-a24-1237743-debenhams-brands-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Gelcard Ltd t/a Water2,,"An email from Water2, a water filter company, received on 16 May 2024, featured the subject line “UPDATE: It’s gotten worse”. The body of the email stated, “Hi all, 100 people have fallen ill in Devon now. We can't standby [sic] and watch this happen. […] We have made Water2 just £99 today. USE CODE: URGENT at checkout […] Every home in the UK needs a water filter. We have built a 30,000+ strong community of people brave enough to oppose UK tap water. This event is it, the day where everyone understands that we were right all along. UK tap water is broken. Please protect yourself with a filter. Again, just £99 with the code URGENT Stay safe and please drink filtered water. We'll speak soon. Team Water2”.","The complainant challenged whether the ad was misleading, irresponsible, and caused fear and distress without justifiable reason.","Gelcard Ltd t/a Water2 explained that the ad used the example of the current cryptosporidium contamination in Brixham drinking water to highlight their wider concerns with UK drinking water. They considered that the issue in Brixham was not an isolated case and they provided two news articles and a peer-reviewed study which they believed demonstrated that the poor quality of UK drinking water had been widely reported by scientists and news outlets. They also provided another news article that quoted data from the government’s Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) and showed a total of 34 E. coli and Enterococci breaches in England and Wales in 2022. While they understood that UK drinking water had a quality rating of 99.96% and was regularly monitored for contamination, they believed the quality was not good enough, and the safety standards by which the water was tested were incomplete and outdated. For example, the water was only tested for two types of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), despite being a large group of manmade chemicals with reported health effects if consumed. Water2 believed the ad was factually correct in stating that 100 people had fallen ill in the area and that the situation had “gotten worse” since an earlier email they had sent about the issue. They said they had received messages from people affected by the contamination and had decided to reduce the price of their water filter so that it would be more accessible to those consumers in need. The statement, “This event is it, the day where everyone understands that we were right all along” referred to the significance of the contamination in Brixham for bringing into the public awareness the issues with the UK’s tap water. The advertiser provided a further news article about the Brixham community’s diminished trust in their water supplier. They believed the ad demonstrated Water2’s commitment to spreading awareness of the poor quality of drinking water in the UK through the promotional offer and statements such as “We can’t standby [sic] and watch this happen”, “Our shareholders didn’t love this idea, but they understand”, “Stay safe” and “We’ll speak soon”. Water2 believed that, while the ad was likely to cause reasonable concern, it did not amount to fear or distress. They emphasised that the claim “Every home in the UK needs a water filter” referred to the severity of the contamination in Brixham, the prevalence of similar contaminations around the UK, as shown by DWI data, and the general context of the poor quality of drinking water in the UK and implications that had on the health of the UK public. They clarified that, the use of “need” within the claim communicated that it was very important, rather than just desirable, that every home in the UK had a water filter. They said claims that UK tap water was “broken” and “protect yourself with a filter” similarly conveyed the poor state of the UK’s drinking water and its contamination with substances such as cryptosporidium, lead and PFASs. They pointed out that 80% of the Environment Agency’s fines in 2022 were given to the water sector, which they believed would not be the case if this sector was working as it should. Water2 confirmed that their product was able to filter cryptosporidium.","The ad was seen in the context of a public health event that affected 16,000 properties in Brixham, Devon, after cryptosporidium, a parasite that could cause a diarrhoeal disease, was found in the area’s water supply. The ASA understood that at the time of the ad, 22 cases of cryptosporidiosis had been confirmed, with up to 100 more reporting symptoms to their GP. Affected residents were being advised not to drink tap water without boiling it first. We considered that consumers would understand the subject line “UPDATE: It’s gotten worse” and the opening claim “100 people have fallen ill in Devon now” both referred to the water contamination in Brixham. Along with the claim, “We can’t standby [sic] and watch this happen” and a promotional offer which their “shareholders didn’t love”, we considered the ad implied that the situation had reached a level of severity, such that the advertiser felt compelled to act. The ad contained subsequent claims about UK tap water more generally, including “Every home in the UK needs a water filter” and “UK tap water is broken”. We considered that the description of UK tap water as “broken” would be understood by consumers to mean that the system was no longer fit for purpose or working as it should, and that the situation in Brixham was an example of the consequences of the UK’s “broken” tap water. We considered that impression was reinforced by other claims such as “protect yourself with a filter” and “stay safe and please drink filtered water”. We understood that the marketing email was sent to consumers around the UK; the ad therefore suggested the drinking water across the UK was open to risk of similar contamination and that consumers across the UK were at risk of disease by drinking unfiltered tap water. The ad addressed the reader directly, urging them to “protect” themselves and “stay safe” by consuming only filtered water, and included a promotional code “URGENT”, which allowed the recipient to purchase a discounted water filter. We considered that the urgent tone and alarmist language used in the ad conveyed it was necessary for consumers to take urgent action and further contributed to the impression that drinking unfiltered tap water was a health risk. With that in mind, we considered the ad was likely to cause fear. Furthermore, we understood that the contamination in Brixham tap water was a temporary situation and was contained to the affected area. The boil water notice was not in place for the rest of the UK. We therefore considered that the ad exaggerated the health risks of UK drinking water and exploited people’s fears that tap water across the UK was unsafe to drink. We therefore concluded that, on the basis of a temporary situation limited to a certain geographical area, the ad was misleading, irresponsible and would likely cause fear and distress that was not justified. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 3.1 (Misleading advertising), and 4.2 (Harm & Offence).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Gelcard Ltd t/a Water2 to ensure their future marketing communications did not cause unjustified fear or distress on the basis of misleading claims.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/gelcard-ltd-a24-1245866-gelcard-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on MYA Clinics Ltd t/a MYA Cosmetic Surgery,,"Two display ads for MYA Cosmetic Surgery seen on the Quizlet website, an online resource providing tools for studying: a. The first display ad, seen on 26 March 2024, stated “MYA COSMETIC SURGERY Fat removal can be a great solution! Book your FREE consultation”. b. The second display ad, seen on 9 April 2024, stated “MYA COSMETIC SURGERY” and showed two photos of a woman’s torso side-by-side that were labelled “Before” and “After”. In the “After” photo, the woman appeared slimmer.",Two complainants challenged whether the ads were directed at those below 18 years of age through the selection of media or context in which they appeared.,"MYA Clinics Ltd t/a MYA Cosmetic Surgery said that the ads should not have been targeted at under-18s. They were fully aware that their ads for cosmetic surgery should only be targeted at over-18s and apologised for this error. They stated that they typically implemented block lists in order to address irrelevant website traffic. They said that in this case, Quizlet was not on a block list. They were now reviewing all sites they advertised on and had block-listed education sites, including Quizlet. Match2One, the programmatic advertising platform used by MYA Cosmetic Surgery, said that the ads had been correctly categorised as cosmetic surgery and their external audit partner had confirmed that. Quizlet Inc said that it was their mission to help students learn effectively and safely on their platform and that they took ad safety very seriously. They stated that Quizlet’s policy prohibited ads for any health or medical procedures, including cosmetic surgery, from appearing on their website, regardless of the age of the user. They said that they had blocks on their site related to medical procedures, but that these blocks were reliant on the ads being correctly categorised by the advertiser. They stated that although their ad tools allowed them to block certain ad categories, including medical procedures, the technology available could not guarantee that 100% of such ads would be blocked. Quizlet confirmed that the majority of their users were aged 18 or over and they provided confidential information on the age demographic of its account holders.","The CAP Code required that marketing communications for cosmetic interventions must not be directed at those aged below 18 years through the selection of media or context in which they appeared. Advertising Guidance stated that for non-broadcast advertising, ads for cosmetic interventions should not be placed in media that are aimed at under-18s, and in media in which 25% or more of the audience profile is under-18. The ads, which appeared on the Quizlet website, advertised fat removal surgery and promoted a free consultation to discuss the surgery. Furthermore, ad (b) showed “Before” and “After” photos of a woman’s torso to demonstrate the results of the procedure. We therefore considered that the ads were marketing communications for cosmetic interventions. We understood that, when placing the ads, MYA Cosmetic Surgery had not excluded any education sites, including Quizlet, from their targeting. When considering complaints about the targeting of age-restricted ads, the ASA firstly assessed whether the media in which the ad was served was appropriate. The ASA understood that Quizlet was aimed at students of all ages including under-18s, and included GCSE and A-level content. We also understood that many students in Scotland started university at the age of 17 and therefore any degree-level content would be relevant to that group. As such, we considered that the website would have been of interest to some under-18s, and we therefore expected MYA Cosmetic Surgery to demonstrate that less than 25% of the total Quizlet website audience was under 18 years of age. Furthermore, we understood that one of the complainants was under 18, and the other had been on an A-level related webpage when they saw the ads. We assessed the demographic data on their account holders which Quizlet had provided to us. Whilst the majority of account holders were registered as aged 18 and older, a significant proportion of account holders were aged under 18. It was also possible for younger users to misreport their age. Furthermore, we understood that users did not have to have an account in order to use some of the features of the website. Whilst we had therefore not seen demographic data for all website users, we considered that the nature of the site and the demographic data provided strongly indicated that a significant proportion of website users were under 18. We therefore considered that the website was not an appropriate media in which to place ads for cosmetic interventions. We considered that MYA Cosmetic Surgery had not taken sufficient care to ensure that the ads for cosmetic surgery were directed at an audience aged 18 and over, and therefore concluded that the ads had not been targeted responsibly. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.25 (Cosmetic Interventions).",We told MYA Clinics Ltd t/a MYA Cosmetic Surgery to ensure that their ads were appropriately targeted in future.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/mya-clinics-ltd-g24-1241715-mya-clinics-ltd.html

Further text in the image stated “Based on clinical results 92% Prostate related pain 90% Reduced urgency & frequency […]”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it made medicinal claims for an unlicensed product.,Person(s) unknown t/a Nultqh GB did not respond to the ASA enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Person(s) unknown t/a Nultqh GB’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code as well as their failure to provide their full name and geographical business address, which were in breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.7 (Unreasonable delay) and 1.7.1 (Compliance). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries without delay and told them to do so in the future. The CAP Code stated that medicinal claims and indications could only be made for a medicinal product that was licensed by the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A medicinal claim was a claim that a product or its constituent(s) could be used with a view to make a medical diagnosis or could treat or prevent disease, including an injury, ailment or adverse condition, whether of body or mind, in human beings. We considered that consumers would understand the claims “One patch to solve the problem of frequent urination and urgency […] easily say goodbye to the prostate problems”, “EASILY SOLVE YOUR TROUBLES Frequent urination & urgent urination Hyperplasia and hypertrophy Painful urination Abdominal distension”, and “Based on clinical results 92% Prostate related pain 90% Reduced urgency & frequency […]” to mean that the patch could treat prostate issues including those related to pain and urination, as well as an enlarged prostate. We therefore considered those were medicinal claims which required the product be licensed as a medicine. However, we understood that the product did not have the relevant marketing authorisation from the MHRA and because of that no medicinal claims could be made for the product. Because the ad made medicinal claims for a product which was not licensed, we concluded that the ad breached the Code.

We reminded them of their responsibility to provide this information to the ASA or CAP without delay if requested. We considered that consumers would understand from ads (a), (b), (c), and (d) that the locksmiths were local traders in Chalfont St Peter, Cranleigh, Frimley, and West Molesley, which were based at and operating from the addresses stated in the ads. The ads all featured a single address and phone number under the “Contact Us” heading. Ad (a) included a Google Maps search result image with a pin showing the location of the locksmith business. Ads (b) and (d) featured images of shop fronts with banners containing the business name and phone number, which further added to the impression that physical premises for the locksmiths existed in Cranleigh and West Molesley. The ads all featured the claims “We’ve served the area for several years,” “Our local emergency Locksmiths aim to be with you within 30 minutes of your call where possible,” “Our aim is to resolve the situation as quickly as possible (30-minute fast response),” and “One of the most common reasons people call a local Locksmith is because their keys have been lost or stolen.” We considered those claims implied that the locksmiths were local traders, operating in the area, who would be able to attend to consumers within a short period of time. We further considered that for consumers who had lost their keys, were locked out, or were in an emergency situation, it would be very important for them to be able to contact a locally based locksmith who would be able to respond quickly. However, we had not seen any evidence that a locksmith business operated from any of the addresses featured in the ads and we understood that the addresses were in fact for residential homes or for a different and unrelated business. Ostensibly, the websites advertised separate locksmith businesses based in different areas of England. However, we noted the websites were all similarly designed and laid out, with the same headings and text on one web page. They also stated that they had been created by the same person. The ads all featured two testimonials with the same wording, but which was attributed to different individuals, including one said to be based in San Francisco, USA. We were also aware that the same individual had created other websites for locksmiths in additional locations in England, which we were concerned were not for genuine businesses. Because we considered that ads (a), (b), (c), and (d) gave the overall impression that they were for a local locksmith business or tradesperson based in the areas of Chalfont St Peter, Cranleigh, Frimley, and West Molesey, when that was not the case, we concluded the ads were misleading and breached the Code.

The post included an image of a pack shot and the underwear, along with text that stated “Based on 2-weeks clinical test 95% Reduces urinary urgency 92% Eliminates pain related to prostate 94% Reduce prostate enlargement”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it made medical claims for an unlicensed product.,Person(s) unknown t/a Cishx GB did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Person(s) unknown t/a Cishx GB’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code as well as their failure to provide their full name and geographical business address, which were in breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.7 (Unreasonable delay) and 1.7.1 (Compliance). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries without delay and told them to do so in the future. The CAP Code stated medicinal or medical claims and indications could only be made for a medicinal product that was licensed by the MHRA, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. In addition, the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 required that a medical device should be registered with the MHRA before it was placed on the market in Great Britain. The ASA considered consumers would interpret the claims “Don’t let prostate issues hinder your daily activities”, “reclaim your comfort and confidence”, and “95% Reduces urinary urgency 92% Eliminates pain related to prostate 94% Reduce prostate enlargement” to mean that the underwear could treat prostate issues, including those related to pain and urination, as well as an enlarged prostate. We therefore considered those claims were medical claims which therefore required that the product met the requirements for medical devices. However, we had not seen evidence that the product was registered with the MHRA and held the appropriate conformity marking. Therefore, no medical claims could be made for the product. Because the ad made such claims, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.10 (Legality) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Person(s) unknown t/a Cishx GB not to make medical claims for devices that did not hold the applicable conformity marking and were not registered with the MHRA. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/person-s--unknown-a24-1245836-person-s--unknown.html
ASA Ruling on Sky UK Ltd t/a NOW,,"The home page of the Now TV website, www.nowtv.com, seen on 29 March 2024, featured an offer at the top for “ENTERTAINMENT 6 MONTH SAVER Just £9.99 [crossed through] £6.99 a month” followed by details about the plan including the minimum subscription term, the inclusion of free trials for Cinema and Boost and the plans’ cancellation policy. Further “Terms & Conditions” were listed below in a drop-down section, in small text, stating “… Cinema and Boost members only. After your 7-day free trial […] Boost auto-renews at £6 a month, unless cancelled. You can cancel anytime. Ad-free excludes live channels and trailers promoting NOW content. Boost features available on selected content and devices only. See here for more details”. That text hyperlinked to a webpage which included more details of the “Boost” features. Under the information about the “SAVER” offer on the home page, the Entertainment, Cinema and Sports membership options were presented next to each other under the text “CHOOSE YOUR MEMBERSHIP Pick the experience that’s right for you”. Two bullet points for each plan gave brief information; for example, for the “Entertainment” option it stated “Unmissable dramas and exclusive shows” and “HBO box sets and brand new Sky Originals”. “Choose membership” buttons hyperlinked to relevant webpages with up to three plans on offer for each type of membership. At the bottom of the home page a “Frequently asked questions” drop-down section included “What do I get with NOW Boost? […] Ad-free: Enjoy an ad-free experience. Ad-free excludes live channels and trailers promoting NOW content”.","The complainant challenged whether the ad was misleading, as it did not make clear that without the ‘Boost’ upgrade, all NOW TV membership plans included ads.","Sky UK Ltd t/a NOW acknowledged that the ad did not state that the on-demand content available as part of NOW’s membership plans would feature advertising. However, they considered that the presence of ads was not a main characteristic of the service and therefore that it was not material information. They did not view it as a significant limitation or qualification to the claims featured in the ad. Omitting the presence of ads as part of a basic membership plan would not cause an average consumer to make a different transactional decision than they would otherwise have made. It was not likely to mislead consumers in terms of their understanding of the plans or their decision to purchase a NOW TV membership plan. NOW TV had shown ads for its own content since around 2015, including content requiring consumers to upgrade, and had introduced a basic membership plan that featured advertising before and during streams of individual shows or movies in July 2021. That type of model was commonplace and well established among streaming services available in the UK. They said it was clear on consumer advice websites that ad-free and ad-supported membership plans were common and this appeared to be well understood by consumers. They therefore did not believe it was reasonable for the average consumer simply to assume that a streaming service was ad-free. If it was important to a consumer that a service was ad-free, NOW would expect them to look at the additional information on their website to clarify whether the service contained ads or not. The average consumer visiting the NOW website would reasonably expect basic membership plans to include ads. In addition, like most other streaming services, NOW offered a premium upgrade option, NOW Boost, which provided additional features that allowed customers to improve their viewing experience at an additional cost. A common feature of such premium upgrades was the ability to go “ad-free” for on-demand content that would otherwise feature ads. They considered that the assertion that the absence of an explicit warning about ads in NOW’s basic membership plans constituted a misleading omission was unreasonable and failed to reflect the prevailing position across UK streaming services. They added that the information about the NOW Boost upgrade which was accessible via the “How NOW works” link at the top of the nowtv.com landing page made it clear that without upgrading to NOW Boost, a basic membership plan would include ads in on-demand content.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information. They must not mislead by hiding material information or presenting it in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner. Material information was information that the consumer needed to make informed decisions in relation to a product; this included the main characteristics of the product. It was Sky’s view that it was commonplace amongst streaming services that basic membership plans would include advertising, while premium upgrades would be ad-free. The ASA acknowledged that ads were increasingly becoming part of the streaming landscape and that many streaming services had adjusted their pricing models to include ad-supported plans. However, this was not universal, and we considered it to be a relatively new shift (starting in 2021) in the subscription on-demand streaming market, which was traditionally ad-free. We therefore considered that consumers would, at the time the ad was seen in March 2024, expect that free streaming services would include ads, but that consumer expectations for paid services would be mixed. Some may, therefore, expect them to include ads, but many would not expect that to be the case. We considered that, when choosing a streaming membership plan, the presence of ads would be a key factor for a significant proportion of consumers who prioritised uninterrupted and seamless content-viewing over price. Other consumers would prioritise price over ad-free viewing. Consumers from both groups would therefore view the presence, or not, of ads as a main characteristic of the service. Therefore, we considered that the inclusion of ads with NOW’s basic streaming membership plans was material information that needed to be clearly presented for consumers to make an informed decision about which NOW TV membership plan to purchase. The NOW TV home page featured a section at the top of the page that promoted the “ENTERTAINMENT 6-MONTH SAVER” plan. Text in the main body of that section included material information about that promotion, including that consumers who purchased an Entertainment plan would also get seven-day trials of Cinema and Boost as well access to streaming TV shows, for £6.99 a month. However, information about the details of the NOW Boost upgrade did not appear in the main body of the text but in the “Terms & conditions” drop-down at the bottom of that section. Among several terms and conditions, the text briefly mentioned the ad-free offering, stating that “Ad-free excludes live channels and trailers promoting NOW content”. However, it did not state that this was one of the Boost features, nor did it make clear that it was not part of the basic Entertainment plan. Further text hyperlinked to a “Boost” webpage where the ad-free offering was clearly listed as one of its features. This information was therefore two clicks away from the main body text. The next section of the webpage included information about the types of content included in the Entertainment, Cinema, and Sports membership plans, but did not state that those membership plans included ads. Website visitors could click on a membership plan and follow through to complete a purchase without being presented with clear information that those plans included ads unless they subscribed to the Boost upgrade. Finally, at the bottom of the home page, under the question “What do I get with NOW Boost?” drop-down in the “Frequently asked questions” section, information clearly explained that the Boost upgrade was ad-free. We noted that neither the home page nor webpages about the different basic membership plans clearly set out that those plans included ads. Additionally, information that clearly set out that the Boost upgrade was the service which enabled ad-free viewing was either two clicks away from the main body text which described membership plans, or one click away and at the bottom of a long webpage. We concluded that the ad omitted the material information that the basic Entertainment, Cinema and Sports plans included ads, and did not make sufficiently clear that to have ad-free viewing, consumers must pay an additional cost for the Boost upgrade. The ad therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.4.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 and 3.10 (Qualification).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Sky UK Ltd t/a NOW to ensure that future ads did not omit material information, such as the inclusion of ads with basic streaming membership plans.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/sky-uk-ltd-a24-1240257-sky-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on WHG (International) Ltd t/a William Hill Online,,"Two ads for William Hill, both seen on 15 April 2024: a. A paid-for search ad, seen on Bing, included text stating “Bet £10 Get £60 Welcome Bonus […]”. It linked through to ad (b). b. A website, www.williamhill.com, featured a heading stating “New Customer Offer. Get £60 From A Minimum £10 Bet” followed by a “Join Here” button. Small print under the button included text stating “Payment methods & country restrictions apply. Full T&C’s apply”. The full terms and conditions were listed in small print further down the page and included text stating “This promotion is not available to new accounts where funds are paid into by […] Apple Pay […]”.","The complainant who believed that the restriction on the use of Apple Pay was a significant condition of the promotion that had been omitted from ad (a) and was not sufficiently prominent in ad (b), challenged whether the ads were misleading, and the promotion breached the Code.","WHG (International) Ltd t/a William Hill Online (William Hill) explained that they had restricted certain payment options in relation to the offer as a way of minimising the risk of consumers being able to take advantage of the new customer sign-up offer multiple times. Historically they had found that certain e-wallet payment methods, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, had limitations in matching ownership of that payment method with the registered gambling account owner at the beginning of the customer relationship. This, therefore, increased the risk of people taking up an offer, intended for new customers only, multiple times. They understood that such restrictions were common across the industry. They said that of the 3,383 customers who took up the offer after accessing the link in ad (a) to ad (b), only 97 deposited using excluded payment methods, such as Apple Pay. They provided a copy of the customer journey from ad (b) to the various payment options. They understood that where ads were significantly limited by space, and readers could click through to more information, it might be acceptable for significant conditions to be on the landing page and less important conditions to be one click away. They believed that ad (a), a search engine ad, was significantly limited in space and therefore could not include all significant conditions. They pointed out that the ad clicked through to the website landing page which did contain information about the payment method restrictions. However, they also understood that the initial ad should always indicate that terms and conditions applied, and they acknowledged that was not the case in ad (a). They said they had reviewed and updated ad (a) so that in future it would include “ts&cs apply” or similar wording to that effect. In relation to ad (b), they said that it served two purposes: consumers could arrive at that page by clicking through from ad (a); or they could arrive at the page directly and it would be the first time they saw the promotion. They had therefore structured ad (b) in a way which included a headline, key qualifying criteria and full terms and conditions. They said the terms and conditions were in a font larger than the key qualifying criteria and may have been visible immediately or consumers may have had to scroll down slightly depending on their choice of screen size and font size. They said the key qualifying criteria in ad (b) were clear, prominent and included the qualification “Payment methods & country restrictions apply. Full T&Cs apply”. They believed that wording was sufficiently prominent for any consumer to see, as it was positioned directly under the offer and clearly identified that there were payment restrictions. They believed that conveyed to consumers that not all payment methods would be accepted for the promotion and encouraged consumers to make an informed decision before taking up the offer. They pointed out that the full list of excluded payment methods was provided under the header “Key Terms” where text stated “This promotion is not available to new accounts where funds are paid into by PayPal, Neosurf, Paysafe, Nuvei, Apple Pay, NETELLER, Skrill, ecoPayz, Kalibra/Postpay or William Hill PLUS Card.” They said they had considered whether the payment exclusions would amount to significant conditions and whether to present them in the key qualifying criteria at the top of ad (b). However, they considered that information was extensive and would have taken up significant space. Furthermore, they believed that the text stating “Payment methods & country restrictions apply. Full Ts&Cs apply” at the top of the ad was sufficient to make consumers aware of payment method restrictions and if they had wanted to check whether their chosen payment method was accepted, they were able to scroll down the page to find that information in the full terms and conditions. They believed that the general reference to “Payment methods restrictions apply” was adequate for consumers to understand the promotion. The omission of the full list of payment method exclusions, therefore, from the top of ad (b) did not make the ad misleading. The full terms and conditions, which they believed were sufficiently prominent and on the same web page, allowed customers to check whether their specific payment method would be accepted.","The CAP Code stated that all marketing communications referring to promotions must state all applicable significant conditions where their omission was likely to mislead. Significant conditions may, depending on the circumstances, include information about how to participate and technological or other restrictions. The ASA considered that the fact that certain payment options, including Apple Pay, were excluded from the offer, meaning new customers using that payment method would not receive the £60 welcome bonus, was a significant condition likely to affect a consumer’s understanding about how to participate in the promotion. The omission of that information was likely to mislead. Ad (a) contained no information regarding certain payment methods being excluded from the offer. Although the ad contained a link through to ad (b), which did contain information about the excluded payment methods, the Code required that significant conditions must be stated in all marketing communications referring to promotions where the omission of that information was likely to mislead consumers. We considered the ad was not sufficiently limited by space to justify the omission of that significant condition. Ad (b) contained small print under the header “New Customer Offer. Get £60 From a Minimum £10 Bet” including “Payment methods & country restrictions apply. Full Ts&Cs apply”. Further small print down the page appeared under the headers “How to take part:”, “Key terms:”, “Vegas Bonus”, “Sportsbook Bonus” and “Full Terms and Conditions”. In paragraph “c.” under the “Key terms” heading, text stated “This promotion is not available to new accounts where funds are paid into by […]”. A list of payment options followed that included Apple Pay. We considered that the text “Payment methods […] restrictions apply” at the top of ad (b) did not make sufficiently clear to consumers that if they deposited funds using certain payment methods including Apple Pay, they would not receive the £60 welcome bonus. That text was not linked to the relevant text in the “Key terms” section further down the page, and it was therefore not clear where that information could be found; consumers would have been required to read all the small print under the “How to take part” heading and some under the “Key terms” heading to locate that information. We considered that because the excluded payments information was a significant condition of the promotion, although it was not omitted entirely from ad (b), its position meant that it was easy for consumers to overlook it and was therefore insufficiently prominent. For those reasons, we concluded that the ads were misleading and the promotion breached the Code. Ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.2 (Promotional marketing), 8.17, 8.17.1, 8.17.7 and 8.18 (Significant conditions for promotions). Ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.10 (Qualification), 8.2 (Promotional marketing), 8.17, 8.17.1, 8.17.7 (Significant conditions for promotions).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told WHG (International) Ltd t/a William Hill Online to ensure that their future marketing communications referring to promotions included all significant conditions, where the omission of those conditions, or their positioning in an insufficiently prominent place, was likely to mislead.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/whg--international--ltd-a24-1242050-whg--international--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Ejec Ventures LLC t/a Auri Nutrition,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on claims that food supplements treat anxiety. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. See related rulings published on 24 July 2024. Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad for supplement company Auri Nutrition, seen on 20 March 2024, featured a testimonial which stated “I was extremely skeptical overall because of what the product promises but I am so absolutely thrilled with the results. I feel so sharp and focused with increased energy overall. I’m going to be ordering some for my 83 year old mom who is struggling with memory fog and fatigue. I cannot wait for her to try them. – Lisa W”. A video below contained a voice-over which stated, “[…] nootropic super mushroom gummies. There’s 3,000mg of adaptogens crammed into these gummies […] They work as a secret weapon to eliminate stress, obliterate brain fog, and improve focus […] twelve powerful super mushrooms like Lion’s Mane, Royal Sun, and Chaga […] just two of these gummies can transform your life in ways you wouldn’t believe”.","1.The ASA challenged whether the claim that the gummies could “eliminate stress” implied that the product could prevent, treat or cure human disease, which was prohibited by the Code.The ASA also challenged whether the following claims breached the Code: 2. the specific health claims “nootropic”, “adaptogen” and those relating to focus, energy and fatigue, memory and brain fog; and 3. the general health claims “just two of these gummies can transform your life in ways you wouldn’t believe”, “super mushroom”, and “powerful super mushroom”.",,"1. Upheld The CAP Code prohibited claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease. The ASA welcomed Auri Nutrition's assurance that they had removed the ad and in future would not make claims that did not comply with the CAP Code. However, we considered the claim in the ad relating to the elimination of stress would be understood by consumers as an implied claim to prevent, treat or cure anxiety. We therefore considered it was a claim that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure disease. We concluded that it therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register) were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health. We considered the claims relating to energy and fatigue, which included “struggling with [...] fatigue” and “increased energy” would be understood by consumers to mean that the supplement would improve energy levels and reduce tiredness and physical and mental fatigue. The claims relating to focus, memory and brain fog, which included “I feel so sharp and focused”, “improve focus”, “struggling with memory fog” and “obliterate brain fog” would be understood as meaning that the supplement would help cognitive function and mental performance. Those claims related to specific beneficial health effects and were therefore also specific health claims. We considered that while some consumers may not be familiar with the terms “nootropic” and “adaptogen”, they related to specific health benefits. We understood the term “nootropic” was used to describe substances which enhanced cognitive function. We considered that those consumers familiar with the term would therefore understand the claim to mean that the gummies would help with cognitive function and mental performance. We understood the term “adaptogen” was used to describe natural substances believed to help the body respond to stress. We therefore considered the claim “adaptogen” would be understood to mean that the gummies would support the body’s ability to respond to stress. “Nootropic” and “adaptogen” were therefore specific health claims. We had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that the above specific health claims were authorised on the GB Register in relation to the advertised supplement or any of its listed ingredients, including Lion’s Mane, Royal Sun, and Chaga. They therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims), and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). 3. Upheld The CAP Code also stated that general health claims could be made in relation to foods only if they were accompanied by a relevant specific, authorised health claim. General health claims were defined as those referring to a general benefit of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health related well-being. The ad featured the claims “just two of these gummies can transform your life in ways you wouldn’t believe”, “super mushroom”, and “powerful super mushroom”, which we considered to be general health claims for the purposes of the Code. However, the ad did not contain any specific authorised health claims.Because the ad featured general health claims that were not accompanied by a specific authorised health claim, we concluded that they breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Ejec Ventures LLC t/a Auri Nutrition to ensure their ads did not make claims that a food or food supplement could prevent, treat or cure human disease.

ASA Ruling on Innocent Health Ltd t/a Novomins Nutrition,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on claims that food supplements treat anxiety. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. See related rulings published on 24 July 2024. Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad from Novomins Nutrition, seen on 27 March 2024, stated “Night-Time Gummies. A happier & healthier you […]”. Further claims included “Prepare for a goodnight’s [sic] sleep”, “Reduction in tiredness and fatigue”, “Deeper Sleep”, “Less Stress” and “Less Anxiety”.","1. The ASA challenged whether the claim “less stress” and “less anxiety” implied that the gummies could prevent, treat or cure human disease, which was prohibited by the Code.The ASA also challenged whether the following claims breached the Code: 2. the specific health claims “reduction in tiredness and fatigue”, “Prepare for a goodnight’s [sic] sleep”, and “deeper sleep”; and3. the general health claim “a happier & healthier you”,","1. Innocent Health Ltd t/a Novomins Nutrition provided clinical studies which they believed showed health benefits of magnesium, vitamin B12, inositol and L-tryptophan, and their effects on stress and anxiety. However, they said they had removed claims regarding stress and anxiety from advertising across their Meta platforms that were in breach of the CAP Code. 2. With regard to the specific health claim “reduction in tiredness and fatigue” they believed the claim was supported by health claims relating to the ingredients niacin and vitamin B12, which were authorised in the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register). They believed the gummies complied with the conditions of use associated with those authorised health claims, which required that the food provide 15% of the reference intake for the relevant substance. They said that per serving, the gummies contained 3 mg of niacin, which was 19% of its reference intake, and 6 µg of vitamin B12, which was 240% of its reference intake. However, they accepted the claims “prepare for a goodnight’s [sic] sleep” and “deeper sleep” should not have been stated in the ad, and had been removed.3. They said the use of the general health claim “A happier & healthier you”, complied with the Code, because it was accompanied by the authorised specific health claim “reduction in tiredness and fatigue”.","1. Upheld The CAP Code prohibited claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease.The ASA considered the claim “less anxiety” would be understood by consumers as a claim to prevent, treat or cure anxiety. We further considered that in the context of the ad, the claim “less stress” would also be interpreted by consumers as an implied reference to anxiety and its symptoms. We therefore considered that the claims to lessen stress and anxiety were claims that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure disease. We concluded that they therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register) were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health. Any authorised health claims made in an ad must meet the associated conditions of use. The ad claimed that the gummies could help people “Prepare for a goodnight’s [sic] sleep”, and have a “deeper sleep”. We considered those claims were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code because they implied that the gummies provided the beneficial health effect of aiding the quality of sleep. However, there were no authorised health claims relating to sleep quality on the GB Register. The claims “Prepare for a goodnight’s [sic] sleep” and have a “deeper sleep” therefore breached the Code. The claim “contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue” was authorised on the GB Register in relation to both niacin and vitamin B12. We understood that the product contained sufficient quantities of both of those vitamins to meet the conditions of use for the authorised claims, and therefore could be used in advertising for it. However, health claims must be presented clearly and without exaggeration. Marketers could exercise some flexibility in rewording claims, provided that the reworded claim was likely to have the same meaning for consumers as the authorised health claim. The aim of the rewording was to aid consumer understanding and taking into account factors such as linguistic and cultural variations and the target population. We considered the phrasing “contributes to” in the authorised claims was important in conveying their full meaning. It made clear that the nutrient named in the claim was only one of a number of nutrients that were involved in providing the stated beneficial physiological effect. We also considered that in the absence of the wording “contributes to”, consumers were likely to interpret the claim “reduction in tiredness and fatigue” as absolute, and so we considered it exaggerated the meaning of the authorised health claim. Additionally, health claims in ads must be clearly attributed to the specific nutrient named in the authorised claim in order to reflect its full meaning. However, the claim in the ad did not attribute the health claim specifically to either niacin or vitamin B12 and instead implied that it related to the product as a whole. For those reasons we considered the claim that the product caused a “reduction in tiredness and fatigue” did not accurately reflect, and exaggerated, the wording of the authorised health claims for niacin and vitamin B12. We therefore concluded that the health claims “Prepare for a goodnight’s [sic] sleep”, “deeper sleep” and “reduction in tiredness and fatigue” were in breach of the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims), and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). 3. Upheld The CAP Code also stated that general health claims could be made in relation to foods only if they were accompanied by a relevant specific, authorised health claim. General health claims were defined as those referring to a general benefit of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health related well-being. The ad featured the claim “unlock a stronger body and state of mind” which we considered to be a general health claim for the purposes of the Code, because it made a general claim for good health and well-being. Because that claim was not accompanied by a specific authorised health claim that complied with the Code, we concluded that it also breached the Code.On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 15.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form investigated.

ASA Ruling on Nowt Ventures Ltd t/a Feel Güd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on claims that food supplements treat anxiety. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. See related rulings published on 24 July 2024. Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","Four paid-for Facebook ads for supplement company Feel Güd, seen in March 2024: (a) The first ad featured the caption “Wanting to be more productive throughout the day - Try the UKs number one functional mushroom gummies, filled with güdness that will help you stay focused, stay calm and help with the effects of anxiety”. The video below had a voice-over which stated, “I took Lion’s mane for a month and here’s the results. I’ve been really overwhelmed recently, so I’ve decided to try out these mushroom gummies from Feel Güd. They contain four different types of mushroom, aimed at improving brain function, energy, and immunity.” Text on the screen stated “improved immunity”, “stable energy”, “improving brain function”, with a green tick symbol next to each claim. Further voiceover stated, “I’m feeling really energised … I’ve just been so much more focused and productive, which has meant that my stress levels are finally stable, and I just have so much more energy throughout the day.” (b) The second ad featured the same caption as ad (a). The video below had a voice-over which stated, “Feel Güd gummies are a blend of four different adaptogenic mushrooms. You’ve got Cordyceps, Lions Mane, Chaga, Reishi … So it’s week two and I’m feeling pretty focused. I’ve been sleeping really well and I feel like I’ve got a lot more energy throughout the day … Ok so it’s been a month and honestly I’ve never felt more productive at work. My focus - So much sharper … Whether you want to improve your focus, your sleep, your energy … check out Feel Güd gummies.” (c) The third ad featured the same caption as ads (a) and (b).

The ASA also challenged whether the following claims breached the Code: 2. the specific health claims in all the ads; and3. the general health claims in all the ads.",,"1. Upheld The CAP Code prohibited claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease. The ASA considered the claims “help with the effects of anxiety” in ads (a)?(d), “my stress levels are finally stable” in ad (a), and “Reduced stress and anxiety” in ad (d), would be understood by consumers as claims to prevent, treat or cure anxiety. We therefore considered that these were claims that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure disease. We concluded that they therefore breached the Code.On that point, ads, (a), (b), (c), and (d), breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register) were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health. We considered that the claims related to energy and fatigue, which included “improving … energy” and “feeling really energised … much more energy throughout the day” in ad (a); “more energy” and “improve your … energy” in ad (b); “No more mid day crashes” and “All-Day Energy” in ad (c); and “Calm Energy” and “Sustained energy” in ad (d), would be understood by consumers to mean that the supplement would improve energy levels and reduce tiredness and physical and mental fatigue. The claims relating to focus, memory and brain fog, which included “Wanting to be more productive”, “stay focused”, “improving brain function”, and “more focused and productive” in ad (a); “feeling pretty focused”, “more productive”, “My focus? So much sharper”, and “improve your focus” in ad (b); “Reduced brain fog” and “Improved focus” in ad (c); and “Mental Clarity” and “Sustained … focus” in ad (d), would be understood as meaning that the supplement would help cognitive function and mental performance. Further, we considered the claims related to bodily function, which included “improving … immunity” and “improved immunity” in ad (a), and “sleeping really well” and “improve your … sleep” in ad (b), would be understood as meaning that the supplement would help with sleep and the immune system. We considered that while some consumers may not be familiar with the terms “adaptogen” and “antioxidant”, they related to specific health benefits. We understood the term “adaptogen” was used to describe natural substances believed to help the body respond to stress. We therefore considered the claim “adaptogen” would be understood to mean that the gummies would support the body’s ability to respond to stress. We understood the term “antioxidant” referred to the function of a substance on the body whereby it helped to protect cells from oxidative stress. We considered that those consumers familiar with the term would therefore understand the claim to mean that the gummies helped through protecting cells from oxidative stress. “Antioxidant” and “adaptogen” were therefore specific health claims. We considered those claims were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code, because they implied that the gummies, which included the ingredients Cordyceps, Lion’s Mane, Chaga, and Reishi, had the beneficial health effects listed above. However, we had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that those claims were authorised on the GB Register in relation to the product or its ingredients, and they therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims), and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). 3. Upheld The CAP Code also stated that general health claims could be made in relation to foods only if they were accompanied by a relevant specific, authorised health claim. General health claims were defined as those referring to a general benefit of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health related well-being.Ad (a) included “functional mushroom gummies”, and “Feel Güd gummies” featured in ads (a)-(d). We considered that these claims, which included the terms “functional” and “Feel Güd”, referred to a general benefit of the supplement for overall good health or health related well-being. We therefore considered them to be general health claims for the purposes of the Code. However, the ads did not contain any specific authorised health claims. Because the ads featured general health claims that were not accompanied by a specific authorised health claim, we concluded that they breached the Code.

Upheld The CAP Code prohibited claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease. The ASA considered the claim in the ad relating to the reduction of anxiety would be understood by consumers as a claim to prevent, treat or cure anxiety. We further considered that in the context of the ad, the claims that the product could combat and reduce stress would also likely be understood by consumers as a reference to anxiety and its symptoms. We therefore considered that the claims to help stress, and the direct claim to reduce anxiety, were claims that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure disease. We concluded that they therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 2.

A The first paid-for Facebook ad from Vitality Greens, seen on 27 March 2024, stated “Elevate Your Life with VitaShroom Gummies! Unlock your full potential, crush stress, and ignite your energy naturally with every delicious bite. [muscle emoji] Discover the secret to sharper focus, youthful vitality, and robust immunity. Your journey to peak wellness starts here – find out how these tiny gummies can transform your life today! #VitaShroomMagic”. b. The second ad, seen in late May 2024, stated in the caption “Feeling foggy and forgetful? Lion’s Mane to the rescue. This superstar mushroom is known for its potential to support cognitive function, focus, and memory. Imagine tackling your workday with a sharper mind! […] packed with Lion’s Mane, making it easy to support your brain health […]. Ready to unlock your mental potential?”. A video included shots of the product and the on-screen text “KNOWING THAT 2 OF THESE A DAY CAN LITERALLY REGROW BRAIN CELLS [brain emoji]”.","1. The ASA challenged whether the claim in ad (a) that the gummies could “crush stress” implied that the product could prevent, treat or cure human disease, which was prohibited by the Code. 2. The ASA and a member of the public challenged whether the ads included specific health claims and general health claims that breached the Code. 3. The ASA also challenged whether Turkey Tail mushroom, an ingredient in VitaShroom Gummies, had the relevant authorisation for marketing, because we understood it was a ‘novel food’.",,"Upheld The ASA was concerned by Person(s) unknown t/a Vitality Greens’ failure to provide their full name and geographical business address, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7.1 (Compliance). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide this information to the ASA or CAP without delay if requested. The ASA was also concerned by Vitality Greens’ lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. 1. Upheld The CAP Code prohibited claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease.The ASA considered the claim “crush stress” in ad (a) was likely to be understood by consumers to be an implied reference to the mental health condition anxiety and its symptoms. We therefore considered that the claim was one that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure disease. We concluded that it therefore breached the Code. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register) were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health. Any authorised health claims made in an ad must meet the associated conditions of use. General health claims were defined as those referring to a general benefit of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health related well-being. They could be made in relation to foods only if they were accompanied by a relevant specific, authorised health claim.Ad (a) included the claims “ignite your energy” and “robust immunity” about the VitaSroom Gummies supplement. Those were claims to provide the health benefits of increasing energy levels and immune function, which were specific health claims. Ad (a) also included the claim “discover the secret to sharper focus” about the VitaShroom Gummies supplement. Ad (b) included claims that the Lion’s Mane mushroom in the same supplement could help people who were “Feeling foggy and forgetful”, and that it was “known for its potential to support cognitive function, focus, and memory”, would “unlock […] mental potential” and provide “[…] a sharper mind”. We considered consumers would understand those claims to mean that the VitaShroom Gummies Supplement, and the Lion’s Mane mushroom in it, could help with various aspects of mental performance and cognitive function. Ad (b) also stated that the supplement could “LITERALLY REGROW BRAIN CELLS” which we considered consumers would interpret as a claim to help brain function. Claims that a supplement or its ingredients could help with mental performance, cognitive function and brain function were specific health claims.Ad (b) also included the claim “support your brain health” which we considered was a more general claim to support the overall health of the brain. That claim was therefore a general health claim for the purposes of the Code. We considered the claims “youthful vitality”, “peak wellness”, and “transform your life today”, in ad (a) would be understood by consumers to mean that the advertised supplement provided overall good health. Ad (a) also included the hashtag “#VitaShroomMagic”, and ad (b) featured the claim that Lion’s Mane was a “superstar mushroom”. In the context of ads which included a range of claims about the health benefits of the supplements, we considered those claims also suggested that the supplement, or Lion’s Mane, provided overall good health. Those claims were also therefore general health claims for the purposes of the Code.Because we had not seen evidence that any of the specific health claims included in the ads were authorised on the GB Register in relation to the VitaShroom Gummies supplement or any of its ingredients, including Lion’s Mane mushroom, we concluded those claims breached the Code. Additionally, none of the general health claims were accompanied by a specific authorised health claim, and those claims therefore also breached the Code.On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1, 15.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). 3. Upheld The ingredients list published online by Vitality Greens, and shown on the product packaging in ad (b), indicated that VitaShroom Gummies included Turkey Tail mushroom (Trametes versicolor). We understood that Trametes versicolor was likely to be considered by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) as an unauthorised novel food that did not have the relevant authorisation for marketing in the UK. Therefore it, and products containing it, should not be sold in the UK. The ingredients list also indicated that the product contained Cordyceps mushroom, although it did not specify which species. While certain species of Cordyceps were not considered to be a novel food in food supplements, we understood that Cordyceps militaris was considered by the FSA to be likely to be an unauthorised novel food. We noted we had not received confirmation from Vitality Greens as to which species of Cordyceps was included in the product.Because the ads had the effect of marketing an unauthorised novel food when it was not legal to do so, we concluded they breached the Code.On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.10 (Legality).","The ads must not appear again in the form investigated.

ASA Ruling on The Benenden Healthcare Society Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A TV ad and a radio ad for Benenden Healthcare, a mutual insurance company: a. The TV ad, seen on 4 February 2024, featured a woman who stated, “Private healthcare? Me?”. A voice-over replied, “Yes Flo, at Benenden Health, everyone’s welcome. No one’s excluded.” On-screen text stated “From 1/4/24 fee increases to £15.59pppm. See T&Cs for limits & exclusions. Dependent on NHS waiting times. UK residents only. Affordable private healthcare for everyone, just £12.80 per person per month”. b. The radio ad, heard on 12 March 2024, featured a person stating, ""With Benenden Health it’s just £12.80 per person per month. What’s the catch? There isn’t one. It’s one price for all with no hidden charges […] everyone is welcome, no one is excluded. Whoever you are Britain, we’ve got you. Search Benenden Health. Healthcare done different. Limits & exclusions apply. Fee reviewed annually. UK residents only.”",The ASA received two complaints:,"The Benenden Healthcare Society Ltd (Benenden Healthcare) said the ads intended to highlight that their plan was affordable and inclusive. They said anyone could join regardless of pre-existing conditions and that they would pay the same monthly price. They said the plan contained no other fees or charges. 1. In relation to ad (a), they explained that they offered not only surgical treatment but 24/7 GP helplines, 24/7 mental health helplines, care planning and social care advice immediately when a member joined. They also offered access to medical diagnosis, physiotherapy, mental health support and cancer support after six months of membership. They acknowledged that certain treatments and procedures were excluded from the plan entirely, but said the ad featured a clear disclaimer which stated ‘terms and conditions’ applied. They said the claim ‘no one’s excluded’ was different to product exclusions and that anybody could join regardless of age or pre-existing medical conditions. Benenden Healthcare believed that due to the low price and because the disclaimer “See T&Cs for limits and exclusions” was clearly visible, viewers who saw the ad would not have expected all medical procedures to be included. They also maintained that all private medical insurance products had certain restrictions. They said viewers would have been able to find out about their membership restrictions through their website or on the phone. They said there was no call to action in the ad and that viewers would have likely viewed the website it they wanted further information. They said they were constrained by time and space and could not therefore have included further information in the ad. Clearcast believed ad (a) was not likely to mislead viewers into assuming all surgeries or medical procedures were included in Benenden Healthcare’s standard package and considered no material information had been omitted. They said the purpose of the ad was to highlight that “everyone’s welcome” at Benenden Healthcare, regardless of an individual’s health records or an existing diagnosis. They said all members had access to the same services.They acknowledged that there were exclusions to several surgeries and treatments, which they believed was the case with all private healthcare plans. They said on-screen text, which stated, “See T&Cs for limits & exclusions”, was a significant disclaimer which informed viewers that there were various conditions attached to Benenden Healthcare’s policy plan. They also said that at no point did the ad reference surgeries or treatments available within the plan. Instead, it stated that everyone was welcome, which was true. 2. In relation to ad (b), Benenden Healthcare confirmed that as of 19 February 2024, surgical treatments were only available after two years of membership. However, they said ‘cover’ did not start after two years. They said that membership started from day one, with access to a range of healthcare services. Therefore, the majority of all other services were available immediately. They believed the phrase “What’s the catch? There isn’t one. It’s one price for all with no hidden charges” accurately reflected that there was one standard monthly price and there were no further charges. They said it also reflected that there were no barriers to anyone joining the plan. They said listeners were unlikely to join the plan due to the ad in isolation and would find out the full details, including restrictions, when visiting the Benenden Healthcare website. Radiocentre said they agreed with the points made by Benenden Healthcare concerning ad (b) and confirmed it was no longer being broadcast.","Ad (a) featured a voice-over which stated, “Benenden Health, everyone’s welcome. No one’s excluded” and featured prominent text which stated “affordable private healthcare for everyone”. The ASA considered that those references gave the impression that anyone could join Benenden Healthcare to access private healthcare, and that, by association, their specific medical needs would be covered by the plan. We considered that the on-screen text stating “See T&Cs for limits and exclusions” was not sufficient to override the overall impression given by the ad that all types of treatments were covered by the plan. We understood that Benenden Healthcare did not cover all types of medical treatments. Examples of excluded procedures included surgeries related to cancer, heart or brain conditions and joint replacements. Whilst we understood that it would be unlikely for a private medical company to cover every unique type of medical problem, the exclusion list contained common and major health related issues, such as surgeries related to cancer. Because the ad gave the impression that all medical procedures were included in the plan, when that was not the case, we concluded that it was misleading. On that point, ad (a) breached BCAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3,1, 3.2 (Misleading advertising), and 3.10 (Qualification). We considered listeners would have been likely to interpret the phrase “What’s the catch? There isn’t one” to mean there were no significant restrictions or limitations that would influence their decision to join Benenden Healthcare. We considered the phrase would have been interpreted as relating to pricing, but also non-pricing issues, including key aspects of the membership plan, such as treatment restrictions or exclusions. However, we understood that as of 19 February 2024, surgical treatments were only available after two years of membership. We considered that would be likely to be viewed by consumers as being a “catch” and was also material information likely to influence a consumer’s decision to join Benenden Healthcare. Because that information was omitted from the ad and the ad stated that there were no catches, when that was not the case, we concluded that it was misleading. On that point, ad (b) breached BCAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.2 (Misleading advertising), and 3.10 (Qualification).","The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of. We told The Benenden Healthcare Society Ltd to ensure that future ads did not mislead consumers or omit material information regarding their healthcare plan, including significant restrictions or exclusions relating to treatment options.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/the-benenden-healthcare-society-ltd-g24-1244669-the-benenden-healthcare-society-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Well Gummies,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on claims that food supplements treat anxiety.

Summary of Council decision: Four issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","Two paid-for Facebook ads and a paid-for TikTok ad for supplement company Well Gummies, seen in March 2024: a. The first Facebook ad included a testimonial which stated “I was extremely skeptical overall because of what the product promises but I am so absolutely thrilled with the results. I feel so sharp and focused with increased energy overall. I’m going to be ordering some for my 83 year old mom who is struggling with memory fog and fatigue. I cannot wait for her to try them. Hannah W”. An image below featured a packet of Well Gummies with the text “All-day Energy, Laser Focus, Zen and Relaxed”. Further text stated “TURKEY TAIL Digestion, LIONS MANE Focus & Memory, CHAGA Anti-Stress, CORDYCEPS Energy & Stamina, REISHI Immunity”. b. The second Facebook ad included the same testimonial as ad (a). An image below featured a packet of Well Gummies with the text “Refuel your brain naturally. Chaga for Stress Relief, Cordyceps for Stamina, Lion’s Mane for Focus, Reishi for Immunity”. Further text stated “Fights Stress, Boosts Focus, Zen Energy, Immunity”. c. The TikTok ad featured a voice-over which stated, “If someone with ADHD ate these three mushrooms, this is what would happen to their body. Studies show Lion’s Mane significantly reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression, while improving focus and concentration, as it destroys brain fog and enhances cognitive ability. The second one is chaga. Chaga massively increases energy as it battles fatigue and boosts your immune system to prevent future diseases. The third one is Cordyceps. Cordyceps clears acne as it contains powerful antioxidants that kill the bacteria which allows acne to grow, all while promoting a healthy heart. These Well Gummies contain all three of these potent mushrooms along with five other ones.”","1.The ASA challenged whether the references to “stress” in ads (a) and (b), and the reference to ADHD and the claims “reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression”, “prevent future diseases” and “clears acne” in ad (c), implied that the product could prevent, treat or cure human disease, which was prohibited by the Code.The ASA also challenged whether the following claims breached the Code: 2. the specific health claims in all the ads; and 3. the general health claims in all the ads .4. The ASA challenged whether Turkey Tail mushroom, an ingredient in the gummies, had the relevant authorisation for marketing, because we understood it was a 'novel food'.",,"1. Upheld The CAP Code (which reflected legislation) prohibited claims that stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease. The ASA considered the references to “stress” in ads (a) and (b) were likely also to be understood in relation to anxiety. In addition to those references, we understood the allusion to ADHD and the claims “reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression”, “prevent future diseases”, and in ad (c) “clears acne”, were, for the purposes of the legislation reflected in the Code, claims to prevent, treat or cure disease, which were prohibited for food and food supplements. We concluded that they therefore breached the Code. On that point, ads (a), (b), and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 2. UpheldThe CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register) were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health. We considered the claims related to energy and fatigue, which included “All-day Energy” and “Energy & Stamina” in ad (a), “Zen Energy” in ad (b), and “increases energy as it battles fatigue” in ad (c), would be understood by consumers to mean that the supplement would improve energy levels and reduce tiredness and physical and mental fatigue. The claims relating to focus, memory and brain fog, which included “sharp and focused”, “Laser Focus”, and “Focus & Memory” in ad (a), “Boosts Focus” in ad (b), and “improving focus and concentration”, “destroys brain fog”, and “enhances cognitive ability” in ad (c), would be understood as meaning that the supplement would help cognitive function and mental performance. Further, we considered the claims related to bodily function, which included “Digestion” in ad (a), “Immunity” in ads (a) and (b), and “boosts your immune system” in ad (c), would be understood as meaning that the supplement would help the digestive and immune system. We considered those claims were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code, because they implied that the gummies, which included the ingredients Turkey Tail, Cordyceps, Lion’s Mane, Chaga, and Reishi, had the beneficial health effects listed above. However, we had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that those claims were authorised on the GB Register in relation to the supplement or any of its ingredients, and they therefore breached the Code.On that point, ads (a), (b), and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims), and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). 3. Upheld The CAP Code also stated that general health claims could be made in relation to foods only if they were accompanied by a relevant specific, authorised health claim. General health claims were defined as those referring to a general benefit of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health related well-being.Ads (a)?(c) included the claim “Well Gummies”, ad (b) featured “Refuel your brain naturally”, and ad (c) included “promoting a healthy heart”. We considered these to be general health claims for the purposes of the Code. However, the ad did not contain any specific authorised health claims.Because the ads featured general health claims that were not accompanied by any specific authorised health claims, we concluded that they breached the Code.On that point, ads (a), (b), and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). 4. Upheld Ad (a) contained the text “TURKEY TAIL” (Trametes versicolor) and we therefore understood that the gummies contained that ingredient. We understood that Trametes versicolor was likely to be considered by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) as an unauthorised novel food that did not have the relevant authorisation for marketing in the UK. Therefore it, and products containing it, should not be sold in the UK. The ingredients list also indicated that the product contained Cordyceps mushroom, although it did not specify which species. While certain species of Cordyceps were not considered to be a novel food in food supplements, we understood that Cordyceps militaris was considered by the Food Standards Authority (FSA) to be likely to be an unauthorised novel food.

The ad included close-up shots of the woman’s chest, which showed visible bruising and scarring.",,"Wild Cosmetics t/a Wild did not consider the ad misleading. They said that the woman featured in the ad only stated that she was a breast cancer survivor and did not state anything to the effect that Wild would stop people from getting breast cancer. Because they had partnered with a breast cancer charity and released a breast-shaped case to support them, it was not surprising that many of their customers were also breast cancer survivors. The ad did not infer that using natural deodorants would stop individuals from developing cancer, and they considered that it was a giant leap to come to that conclusion. They considered that because the lady in the ad had been through breast cancer, she could be referring to various reasons why she would “prioritise [my] health”. They believed that the most obvious explanation for her claim was because Wild was considered a healthy product, made with ingredients such as coconut oil and shea butter, which were moisturising and good for the skin. They considered that this claim was factual. They noted that the ad did not mention at any point “compared to an antiperspirant” or make related claims. They expressed concern that upholding this complaint would prevent breast cancer survivors from advertising natural deodorants.","Upheld The ad featured the claims “As a breast cancer thriver I’m prioritising my health and I’ve decided to finally go Wild” and “I’ve seen so many positive comments about how it’s completely natural […]”. The ASA considered that consumers would understand those claims to mean that the woman featured in the ad had chosen to switch to Wild deodorant from a deodorant that was not “natural”, and that decision was for health reasons.Furthermore, the ad placed significant emphasis on the woman’s history of breast cancer, both by the visual emphasis on her bruising and scarring, and the accompanying claim “As a breast cancer thriver I’m prioritising my health […]”. We understood that there was a common misconception that “traditional” deodorants or antiperspirants (terms which, though distinct in meaning, were often understood interchangeably) that contained ingredients such as titanium dioxide and aluminium and were seen as less “natural” were linked to breast cancer. However, we further understood that this suggested link was unproven. While the ad did not explicitly make reference to that misconception, we considered that it alluded to it. We therefore considered that the ad implied “traditional” deodorants were harmful to health and likely linked to breast cancer, and that Wild, a “natural” deodorant, did not carry that risk.We therefore expected to see evidence to substantiate that the use of ”traditional” deodorants or antiperspirants had a negative impact on health, including a risk of breast cancer and that the Wild deodorant was a safer alternative to those products. Because we did not receive such evidence, we concluded that the implied claim that “traditional” deodorants were harmful to health and likely linked to breast cancer had not been substantiated and was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading Advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors), 3.47 (Endorsements and testimonials) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Wild Cosmetics Ltd t/a Wild to ensure that they did not mislead consumers by implying that there was a link between competing products and breast cancer, unless they held sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/wild-cosmetics-ltd-a24-1235174-wild-cosmetics-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Feel Holdings Ltd t/a Feel,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ads making claims about the treatment of symptoms of the menopause. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Facebook ad for Feel, a supplement brand, seen on 1 May 2024, featured an image of the Feel Menopause product. Large text on the image stated, “Natural Menopause Support”, with smaller text underneath ? “Hot Flushes”, “Sleep”, “Fatigue” and “Night sweats”. The image also contained a testimonial that stated, “I have been using these for well over a year and have no more headaches, muscle aches or hot flushes”. The accompanying caption stated, “Relieve the symptoms of Perimenopause, Menopause, and Post-menopause naturally with the UK’s most reviewed menopause supplement […] Feel Menopause is a completely natural menopause support designed to target common symptoms such as: Hot flushes Night sweats Hormonal balance Low mood and bad sleep”.",,,"Upheld The CAP Code prohibited claims that stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease. The ASA considered that consumers would understand from various claims in the caption and in the image that the supplement was intended to treat or cure the symptoms associated with menopause - for example, “Relieve the symptoms of Perimenopause, Menopause, and Post-menopause”, “menopause supplement” and “natural menopause support”. The ad further stated that the product was “designed to target common symptoms” and listed specific symptoms such as: “Hot flushes”; “Night sweats”; “Hormonal balance”; “Low mood and bad sleep”; “Sleep”; and “Fatigue”. The ad also included a testimonial from a customer who said that, after taking the product, they stopped experiencing “headaches, muscle aches [and] hot flushes”. We considered that consumers would understand from these claims that the product could treat hot flushes, problems with sleeping, hormonal imbalances and muscle aches and joint pains, which were, as implied by the ad, specific symptoms of menopause and would be understood as such. Those claims that the supplement could treat or cure symptoms of the menopause, both in general terms and in relation to specifically described symptoms, were, for the purposes of the Code, claims to treat disease. Such claims were prohibited for food and food supplements. We concluded that the ad made claims that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure disease and therefore it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again.

ASA Ruling on GB Sports Advisors Ltd t/a Geoff Banks Online,,"A website for Geoff Banks Online, www.geoffbanks.bet, a bookmaker seen on 13 April 2024, stated “FOR THE MISSUS: Place a bet on the Aintree Grand National and get a free £10 bet on the Scottish Grand National”.

Free bet will be credited to your account by Saturday 20th of April.”",,"GB Sports Advisors Ltd t/a Geoff Banks Online said they believed all significant conditions for the promotion were made clear in the terms of the original ad and in the text message that was sent to participants on 15 April 2024, which stated how to claim the free bet. They also said that a follow-up email was sent on 17 April 2024 that further explained how to claim the free bet and detailed that the bet had to be placed by 5 pm on 19 April 2024. They said that, despite the complainant seeing the text message, they did not reply until the following day, after the promotion had ended. They also highlighted other entrants had followed all relevant entry criteria and had been credited with a £10 free bet. They reiterated that the follow-up email, received by participants on 17 April 2024, included the closing date for the promotion, and so in their view, the complainant was not disadvantaged in entering the promotion. Geoff Banks Online said they updated the ad on 19 April 2024 to include the closing date. Because they believed the information about how to claim the free bet was clear in the text message sent to entrants, they did not believe the ad was unclear or misleading.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that promotions must communicate all applicable significant conditions or information where the omission of such information was likely to mislead. Significant conditions may, depending on the circumstances, include information about how to participate and a closing date. The ASA understood that, in order to qualify for the free bet, consumers had to reply to a text message received from Geoff Banks Online by 5 pm on 19 April 2024 and to have placed their free bet by that date and time. However, the ad did not state that consumers would receive a text message, nor that they had to respond to it by a certain time and date. Furthermore, the ad did not include the closing date of the promotion explaining that participants would have to have placed the free bet by 5 pm on 19 April 2024. We understood the text message also did not state the time and date by which consumers had to respond. We considered those were significant conditions which were likely to affect consumers’ understanding of the promotion and their decision to participate. We therefore considered their omission was likely to mislead. We understood the advertiser had sent a further follow-up email to entrants clarifying that they had received a text message, and that once responded to, participants would be eligible for their £10 free bet. However, the email did not state the date or time by which participants had to reply to the text message. We also understood the ad was updated the day before the closing date of the promotion, to include the date by which consumers had to place the free bet. However, the ad still did not stipulate that consumers had to respond to a text message by a certain time and date in order to be eligible for the free bet. In any case, we considered all of those conditions should have been presented clearly in the ad itself at the start of the promotion. Because the ad omitted significant conditions about the closing date and how to participate in the promotion, we concluded the promotion breached the Code.

ASA Ruling on Happy Koala LLC t/a MenoDaily,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ads making claims about the treatment of symptoms of the menopause. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad for MenoDaily, a supplement company, seen on 5 April 2024, included a caption that stated, “I’ve lost 8kgs [sic], have zero bloating (used to look 9 months pregnant daily!), my moods are calm and I have so much energy”. Further text stated, “Day 1: Zero brain fog and I feel calmer”, “Day 3: Bloating is GONE & my pants fit better”, “Day 7: I get no hot flashes [sic] – sleep like a baby”, “Day 14: I see a difference on my hips and waist”, “Day 28: All my energy is back – feel like my old self again”. The ad contained an image with three bottles of the supplements and which stated on the label “Hormone Harmony”. Text underneath stated, “Gave me my old self back. Ended my bloating and hormonal weight. Boosts my energy, mood and desire […] It Balanced My Hormones and the Old Me Is Back”.","The ASA challenged whether the ad included claims about food supplements which were prohibited by the Code: 1. stated and implied claims that the supplements, or substances in them, could help to prevent, treat or cure symptoms of the menopause; and 2. a health claim which referred to a rate or amount of weight loss.","1. & 2. Happy Koala LLC t/a MenoDaily said the ad had been shown in error and that it had been removed from being shown to consumers in the UK. As a result of the ASA’s investigation, they had sought third-party advice in relation to the marketing of food supplements in the UK and confirmed they would implement internal training on the issues that had been flagged.","1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease were prohibited for foods and food supplements.The ad stated, “Gave me my old self back […] Boosts my energy, mood and desire”. The ad also stated, “Zero brain fog and I feel calmer”, “I get no hot flashes [sic] – sleep like a baby”, “All my energy is back – feel like my old self again”. The ASA considered consumers would understand these to be claims that the product could help with brain fog, hot flushes and low energy levels. The ad also stated, “I’ve lost 8kgs [sic], have zero bloating (used to look 9 months pregnant daily!)”, “Bloating is GONE & my pants fit better” and “I see a difference on my hips and waist”, which we considered consumers would understand to mean that the supplements could help with weight loss. Lastly, the ad stated, “It Balanced My Hormones and the Old Me Is Back!” and the ad contained an image of the product that stated on the label “Hormone Harmony”, which we also considered would be understood by consumers to mean that it could resolve low hormone levels. We acknowledged that the ad did not state explicitly that the product could help with the menopause. However, we considered in the context of the ad, that the symptoms referenced, along with the name of the advertiser being “MenoDaily”, would be understood by consumers to mean that the advertised food supplements could treat symptoms of the menopause, namely: brain fog, hot flushes, low energy levels, menopause related weight gain, and low hormone levels. Such claims were, for the purposes of the Code, claims to treat disease, which were prohibited for food and food supplements. The ad therefore breached the Code.On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that health claims that referred to a rate or amount of weight loss were not permitted when made in relation to a food. Claims that consuming a food or food supplement could result in weight loss were health claims. The ad stated, “I’ve lost 8kgs”, presented as a testimonial. We considered consumers would understand the claim to mean that as a result of consuming these supplements, the person giving the testimonial had lost 8 kg of weight. Because the ad included a health claim, made in relation to food, that referred to an amount of weight loss, we concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.6 (Food, food supplements and associated health and nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Happy Koala LLC t/a MenoDaily not to state or imply their food supplements could prevent, treat or cure human disease, which for the purposes of the Code included claims to treat or cure the symptoms of menopause.

ASA Ruling on Hurtigruten UK Ltd t/a HX Hurtigruten Expeditions,,"A paid-for ad for cruise company Hurtigruten Expeditions, seen in the digital version of a national newspaper on 6 March 2024, featured the headline claim “Free flights to Svalbard and more”. Further text stated, “Selected Svalbard cruises with free flights […] Since 1896, we’ve been the leaders in sustainable expeditions”.",,"Hurtigruten UK Ltd t/a HX Hurtigruten Expeditions (HX) said in their view an average consumer would not have understood the claim “sustainable expeditions” as including flights. The word “expedition” had much stronger associations with travel by land or sea, and in the context of an ad for an expedition cruise company would have been interpreted as referring to the cruise component of the trip. They said the use of an image of a cruise ship in the ad, along with the text “SAIL THIS SUMMER”, “Selected Svalbard Cruises” and “comfortable, purpose-built ships”, made it clear the ad was for a cruise company. Additionally, it was clear the free flight was included as a time limited offer. That being the case, the claim would be understood as meaning Hurtigruten’s expedition cruises, excluding flights, were sustainable. They explained the claim “sustainable” did not mean the cruises had no environmental impact whatsoever; moreover, that their environmental impact was relatively low in the context of other cruise lines.HX explained that they prioritised environmental responsibility and conservation in their expedition operations. They said they were leaders in sustainable expeditions in the expedition cruise sector – launching the world’s first hybrid electric cruise ship, being the first expedition cruise company to banish polluting heavy fuel oil from their fleet and the first to ban single use plastic. They were the only cruise company to produce a rigorous annual Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) report, and they were the only cruise company to be awarded a “Low” ESG Risk Rating. Their 2023 ESG report showed that since 2022 they had reduced their Scope 1 emissions by 18%, per-passenger waste by more than 30% and edible food waste by 22%. HX said they aimed to make a minimal impact on nature, for example, by using quiet ships to preserve the serene environments they traversed. They also donated cruise nights for scientific researchers, to support projects that included underwater drone surveys of fish spawning grounds, penguin colony monitoring and studying humpback whale behaviour and genetics.","Upheld The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear, and that absolute environmental claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. Environmental claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. The ad featured the claim “Since 1896, we’ve been the leaders in sustainable expeditions”. The ASA acknowledged HX’s comments that consumers would understand the claim as referring to the sea travel aspect of a trip only. However, the claim was not qualified with that information. Svalbard was an archipelago to the north of Norway, and we understood it would be necessary, in most cases, for consumers to fly to the starting point of a cruise in the area. We considered that consumers would therefore interpret the term “expeditions” as meaning the holiday packages offered from Svalbard were likely to include a flight, irrespective of the time-limited free flight offer.We considered “sustainable expeditions” was an absolute claim, which would be understood as referring to the full life cycle of a HX holiday, including travel to and from the destination location. While we acknowledged HX had taken steps to reduce the environmental impact of its cruises, those steps did not cover all aspects of their holiday packages, and were not referred to in the ad. For example, air travel, such as that required to take a HX cruise, produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. In addition, the measures in place were insufficient to support an absolute “sustainable” claim in relation to the cruise aspect of the holiday. We considered the measures taken by HX did not relate to the claim, and that because they had not taken the aforementioned emissions into account, the absolute claim “sustainable expeditions” had not been adequately substantiated. Because the basis of the claim had not been made clear and we had not seen evidence based on the full life cycle of the product to support the absolute claim “sustainable expeditions” as it would be understood by consumers, we concluded the ad had misleadingly minimised the impact of HX’s holidays and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 11.1, 11.3, and 11.4 (Environmental claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Hurtigruten UK Ltd t/a HX Hurtigruten Expeditions to ensure the basis of future environmental claims was made clear and did not give a misleading impression of their expeditions’ environmental impact, and that robust substantiation was held to support them.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/hurtigruten-uk-ltd-a24-1237378-hurtigruten-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Simmer Ltd,,"A Facebook post and paid-for TikTok ad for Simmer, a food delivery service, seen on 28 March 2024: a. The Facebook post on the Simmer Facebook page included a video showing clips from an episode of the BBC programme Dragons’ Den. The video began with brief clips of each ‘Dragon’, with Sara Davies commenting, “I have never been on one of these subscriptions where you get food delivered” followed by a quick cut to her saying “… so what do I pay weekly?”. The video then cut to a man wearing a “SIMMER”-branded top responding, “So we deliver high protein chef-made meals. You get lunch and dinner, Monday to Friday. Sixty different dishes per month, all for just 50 quid”, along with images of Simmer’s food. The video cut to clips of positive reactions from the Dragons including Sara Davies commenting, “Honestly, it’s that good” and Deborah Meaden stating, “I really like this”. b. The paid-for TikTok ad, from the @Simmer.eats account, featured the same video as ad (a).",,,"Upheld The ASA understood that the footage used in the ads was taken from Planthood Ltd’s appearance on a Dragons’ Den episode which aired on 23 February 2023. The ads featured clips from the episode, in which the Dragons asked questions about the product offering, edited alongside Simmer’s own footage responding to those questions. The ads then incorporated cuts from the footage where the Dragons praised Planthood’s product, transitioning to images of Simmer’s own food and branding. We acknowledged that Simmer had removed a paid ad on Facebook featuring the same content within two days of its first publication, but we understood the post on their Facebook page, ad (a), continued to appear after that.We considered that consumers would interpret the ads as featuring genuine content from a Dragons’ Den episode in which Simmer appeared. There was nothing in the content to suggest otherwise, and the ads did not convey a light-hearted “April Fool’s Day” tone and had been published on 28 March rather than 1 April. We considered that the use of footage from Dragons’ Den in which the Dragons expressed approval of Simmer’s products would be understood by consumers as being akin to an endorsement from the Dragons. Therefore, we concluded that the ads gave the misleading impression that Simmer had appeared on Dragons’ Den, and that the Dragons liked, invested in and endorsed Simmer’s products.Ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading Advertising), 3.45, 3.46 and 3.47 (Endorsements and Testimonials).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Electronic Arts Ltd t/a EA,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Golf Clash, a mobile app game, seen on 20 March 2024, showed footage of the game being played. Text at the bottom of the screen appeared that stated, “Includes optional in-game purchases (includes random items)” before quickly disappearing.","The complainant, an academic researcher in game regulation, challenged whether the ad was misleading because it did not make it sufficiently clear the game contained random-item purchasing (loot boxes).","Electronic Arts Ltd t/a EA said the ad disclosed that the Golf Clash game contained random-item purchasing (loot boxes). EA highlighted that the “Advertising guidance on advertising in-game purchases” did not provide specific requirements when disclosing such information and that the prominence of the messaging would depend on a number of factors. They also highlighted that the guidance stated, whilst the disclosure did not need to be especially prominent, it should be easily accessible to consumers and straightforward to find.EA explained that the disclosure was clearly visible for two seconds at the start of the ad, and because of that, believed it was easily accessible and straightforward for consumers to find that disclosure. They also said the font, spacing, colour, capitalisation and layout of the text of this disclosure had been chosen to ensure its prominence in the ad. This was consistent with EA’s best practice guidance on disclosure and use of disclaimers in 2022, when the ad had been created, and which had been updated. They therefore believed that the ad made clear the game contained random item purchases. EA also said the product description for Golf Clash, linked to by the ad, also made clear that the ad contained random item purchases, and that consumers would therefore be aware of their existence in the game before they made a decision to download.In response to the complaint, EA confirmed that they were conducting a review of all their marketing materials to ensure they were consistent with the requirements of the CAP Code and to ensure that the relevant disclosures were even more prominent and readable.","CAP Guidance stated that the presence of in-game purchasing, and particularly random-item purchasing (loot boxes), was material to a consumer’s decision to purchase or download a game, especially for those with specific vulnerabilities. As such, marketers were required to ensure that advertising for the game made clear that it contained in-game purchasing, and, if relevant, that it included loot boxes and that information needed to be easily accessible to consumers and straightforward to find. The ad contained text at the bottom of the video which stated, “Includes optional in-game purchases (includes random items)”. The text was presented in a light grey font and appeared against a moving background of various clips of gameplay footage, including a golden statue, a lake and a golf course. We noted that the gameplay clips were brightly coloured and appeared in rapid succession, and because of that, there was often more than one colour contrast between the text and the background. We therefore found the background creative distorted the appearance of the text and, in combination with the quick-moving nature of the video clips, made it difficult to read the text, which we considered was material information to consumers. We also noted that the size of the text was small and it appeared on screen for only two seconds before disappearing for the remainder of the ad. We considered that likely further impaired a consumer’s ability to sufficiently read and understand the disclosure. Because the presentation of the text within the context of the ad overall was not presented clearly, we concluded the ad was likely to mislead consumers to the presence of loot boxes within the game, which we considered to be material information. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Electronic Arts Ltd t/a EA to ensure that ads for Golf Clash made sufficiently clear that the game contained random item purchasing and that it was presented prominently and clearly.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/electronic-arts-ltd-a24-1239057-electronic-arts-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on London Luton Airport Ltd t/a Luton Rising,,"An ad in a current affairs magazine and a poster on the London Underground for Luton Rising, owners of London Luton Airport (LLA): a. The magazine ad, seen in March 2024, featured an image of an aircraft marshaller signalling to an aircraft and text that stated, “If we miss our environmental limits, our expansion will be stopped in its tracks. If London Luton Airport breaks the environmental limits set out in its expansion proposal, it won’t mean an apology, it will mean further expansion is stopped. Our unique Green Controlled Growth framework will introduce limits for the airport’s noise, carbon, air quality and road traffic impacts. These would be legally binding, and independently monitored”. Text alongside the Luton Rising logo stated, “our airport, our community, our planet”. b. The poster, seen in April 2024, featured the same image as ad (a) and text that stated, “If we miss our environmental limits, our expansion will be stopped in its tracks. Learn more about the expansion of London Luton Airport, with its unique Green Controlled Growth plan. This has legally enforceable, independently monitored environmental limits”. The same Luton Rising logo and accompanying text as ad (a) appeared at the top of the ad.","The complainants, who included Adfree Cities and the Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport (GALBA), challenged whether the ads were misleading because they omitted significant information about the environmental impact of the expansion.","London Luton Airport Ltd t/a Luton Rising said the purpose of the ads was to show people that mitigating environmental impacts were central to the airport’s expansion plans. A fundamental part of their plan was to grow London Luton Airport (LLA) sustainably, and not at the expense of the environment. If expansion was approved, Luton Rising would implement its Green Controlled Growth Framework which placed limits on noise, air quality, emissions from the airport’s operations and road traffic, that would halt expansion if breached or there was a risk they might be breached. That approach was summarised in the ads. The phrase “our environmental limits” in the ads referred to the limits set out in the Green Controlled Growth Framework, which appeared in more detail in the second paragraph of ad (a). That information had not been included in ad (b) for legibility reasons, but the ad invited consumers to find out more information on Luton Rising’s digital channels. They highlighted that neither ad had made claims LLA was a “green airport” or the “greenest airport”, or that no environmental impacts would arise from the proposed expansion. The Green Controlled Growth Framework made clear which emissions it included – those carbon emissions generated by the airport’s operations and by staff and passengers travelling to and from the airport by road.","The CAP Code stated that the basis of environmental claims must be clear and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. The ads were in support of the proposed expansion of LLA and featured the headline claim “If we miss our environmental limits, our expansion will be stopped in its tracks”. They made reference to a Green Controlled Growth Framework which contained legally enforceable and independently monitored environmental limits. Ad (a) explained that those limits included restrictions on the expanding airport’s noise, carbon, air quality and road traffic impacts. Ad (b) provided no further information about the limits. The ASA considered people would understand the main aim of the LLA expansion was to facilitate an increase in capacity at the airport, which would include expansion in the volume of flights the airport could support. The purpose of the ads was therefore to reassure people about the efforts being taken to mitigate the environmental impacts caused by expansion. We considered people would understand from the ads that the proposed expansion was subject to environmental limits and that if they were breached the expansion would stop. Ad (a) included information about the limits in the Green Controlled Growth Framework, which included limits on the expanding airport’s carbon impact. The ad also referred to the expanding airport’s “noise impacts”, which under the proposals included noise from air traffic movement (i.e., landing take-off cycle, and the climb, cruise and descent phase) resulting from the expansion. This would be likely to be understood, in the context of an airport, as meaning noise from both the airport’s ground operations, and from the air traffic movement. We considered the term “carbon impacts” would also be understood in that context, and that people who saw ad (a) would therefore interpret the reference to “carbon” as meaning carbon emissions from both the expanded airport’s ground operations and from the increase in air traffic movement. Ad (b) did not provide further information about the limits included in the Green Controlled Growth Framework. We considered people who saw the ad would understand, from references to “environmental limits” that they would include emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG). They were also likely to assume that limits relating to emissions from an airport would include those from air traffic movement, and would therefore interpret the phrase “environmental limits” in that context as meaning the limits included carbon emissions from both airport ground operations and emissions from air traffic movement. We considered the image of an aeroplane taxiing on a runway in both ads contributed to the impression that emissions from air traffic movement would be a key factor into the Green Controlled Growth Framework. The proposed expansion was due to happen in two phases – in the first the current LLA terminal building would be expanded, and in the second an additional terminal would be built and later expanded. The project was due to take place over a number of years, with monitoring of the different limits on expansion conducted annually. The Green Controlled Growth Framework identified three principal sources of GHG emissions arising from the proposed expansion – airport operations, surface access and air traffic movements. However, although the Green Controlled Growth Framework included limits on noise from all three sources, only the first two were included in the environmental limits on expansion for carbon emissions, with air traffic movements excluded. We understood that in 2019 LLA’s total GHG emissions stood at 1,341,235 tonnes CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent), of which 83.7% were from air traffic movements and around 1.3% were from airport operations. That meant the majority of LLA’s overall GHG emissions came from air traffic movements. We further understood that this figure did not include non-CO2 emissions such as soot particles, nitrogen oxide and water contrails from air traffic movements. As noted above, people would understand the main source of emissions from LLA’s expanded operations would come from additional air traffic movements, and so they would likely expect environmental limits on carbon emissions to include those derived from that source. They would therefore not expect those emissions to have been omitted from the Green Controlled Growth Framework’s limits. Notwithstanding the reasons given in the Green Controlled Growth Framework for excluding air traffic emissions from the expansion’s environmental limits, we considered their exclusion was material information that was likely to affect people’s understanding of the ads’ overall message, and should have been made clear. We concluded the ads omitted significant information and were therefore misleading. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 11.1 (Environmental claims).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Mommy n Toys,,"A paid-for website ad for the “Newborn Baby Anti-Roll Pillow” product, by Mommy n Toys, was seen on the Google News app on 21 April 2024. The ad featured an image of the pillow, alongside text stating “Safe Sleep”.","The complainant, who understood the product would place an infant in an unsafe sleeping position associated with Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI), challenged whether the ad was irresponsible because it condoned or encouraged an unsafe practice.","Mommy n Toys said they had removed all ads for the product, but did not provide further comments on the complaint.Google Ireland Ltd, the service providing the ad platform, confirmed that the ad had been served through Google Ads, a self-administered system. They said that under the terms agreed to by advertisers, it was the advertiser’s responsibility to abide by applicable laws and regulations, including the CAP Code.","The ASA understood that babies whose heads were covered were at an increased risk of SUDI. NHS Guidance on sudden infant death stated that pillows should not be used by babies because they would be unable to push any bedding away, and consequently, were at risk of suffocation if their face became smothered by such items. It also advised against using items with raised or cushioned areas. The ad described the product as being an ‘anti-roll’ pillow for newborn babies, and stated the product would help babies to sleep safely. We considered that consumers would interpret the ad to mean that using an anti-roll pillow was a safe way for newborn babies to sleep. However, we understood that the safest place for a newborn baby to sleep was in a cot or Moses basket, with a firm mattress and that pillows should not be used. We also considered the product had raised and cushioned areas, which were advised against by the NHS Guidance for babies. Because the ad implied that anti-roll pillows could be used for sleeping babies, which contravened NHS Guidance on the dangers of using pillows and their association with SUDI, we concluded that it was irresponsible and encouraged an unsafe practice, particularly as it further described the use of the pillow for sleeping babies as safe. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising) and 4.5 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Mommy n Toys to ensure their future ads were socially responsible and did not encourage or condone unsafe practices, such as using an anti-roll pillow for babies.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/mommy-n-toys-a24-1242723-mommy-n-toys.html
ASA Ruling on Wessex Water Services Ltd,,"A TV ad for Wessex Water, seen on 29 February 2024, featured a voice-over that stated, “Storm overflows protect properties from flooding. They were designed to release wastewater and rainwater into waterways when sewers become overwhelmed. Storm overflows are outdated and unfit for the 21st century. The old ways are no longer the best ways, so we're following a different course. That's why we're investing £3 million a month to tackle storm overflows. Building more storm tanks to increase storage. Separating rainwater from sewage. Treating wastewater naturally using wetlands. And monitoring changes to water quality. We can all find ways to help. Such as collecting rainwater to keep it out of the sewers. And we can bin wet wipes so they don't cause sewer blockages. It won't happen overnight. But a better way, for our waterways, is already underway. Wessex Water. For you. For life.” The ad included various scenes, including an aerial shot of a tree-lined river, and a person inspecting a water sample in a wetlands setting.","The complainant challenged whether the ad was misleading, because it omitted significant information about Wessex Water’s history of releasing sewage into the environment.","Wessex Water Services Ltd t/a Wessex Water said the ad contained no broad claims about environmental performance or the environment in general; rather, it specifically considered the issue of storm overflows, using clear and simple language. The ad openly acknowledged that wastewater was released into the environment when overflows operated and presented a substantiated course of action by which Wessex Water proposed to address that issue.In response to the complainant’s concern that the infrastructure had not been updated in accordance with regulations, Wessex Water said they had invested in accordance with the requirements of the Water Services Regulation Authority (OFWAT). Their five-yearly business plan had also been approved by OFWAT. In support of the claim that £3 million per month was being invested into tackling storm overflows, they provided an overview of capital expenditure for the period 2020 to 2025. Their Storm Overflows Improvement Plan listed their capital investment schemes for increasing storage capacity, introducing nature-based solutions such as reed beds and separating surface water from wastewater. For many years they had monitored and published real-time water quality data for all overflow operations at designated bathing water sites, and at the end of 2023 they had achieved their target of fitting monitors on all other storm overflows in the region. All scenes in the ad, including the construction sites and wetlands, had been shot in the Wessex Water region. Wessex Water acknowledged that their Environmental Performance Assessment (EPA) ratings were low for 2021 and 2022, but anticipated that they would return to a four-star rating when results were published for 2023. They said there had been extensive media coverage of investigations into sewage discharge and storm overflows, and believed viewers would therefore have some knowledge of the issues. They pointed out that “For you. For life” had been their company strapline since 2019 and was not specific to the ad. They said it referred to water being essential for human life and related to the water supply rather than the sewerage aspect of their business. Clearcast said they recognised the importance of ensuring that marketing communications did not downplay or obscure past faults, malpractices or environmental concerns. When they reviewed the ad they took into consideration the wider context of investigations and prosecutions surrounding water companies and sewage release into waterways. In their view, the ad took a balanced and transparent approach by acknowledging and addressing the shortcomings of outdated systems, particularly storm overflows and sewers, while providing an honest account of their forward progress plan. It gave only objective details of the improvements being made. It made no environmental impact statements, and did not imply environmental benefits or discount past events. In the context of an ad that set out and explained the flaws with old systems and detailed future improvements, “A better way for our waterways” did not, in their view, constitute an environmental improvement statement.","The BCAP Code required that ads must not mislead consumers by omitting material information. It specified that the basis of environmental claims must be clear, and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. The ad initially focused on the problems with storm overflows – that is, they discharged sewage into waterways when sewers became overwhelmed with rainwater – and the improvements that Wessex Water were investing in, which was a specific initiative. The ad then broadened out in scope, and stated “The old ways are no longer the best ways, so we’re following a different course […] building more storm tanks to increase storage. Separating rainwater from sewage. Treating wastewater naturally using wetlands. And monitoring changes to water quality. We can all find ways to help […] a better way, for our waterways is already underway. Wessex Water. For you. For life”. The ASA considered the overall impression of the ad was that Wessex Water were currently taking steps to improve their water management and systems not only to protect properties from flooding, but also to reduce environmental damage caused by pollution incidents associated with storm overflow failure. In particular, we considered the claims “a different course”, “For you. For life” and “A better way for our waterways is already underway”, and the visuals of a dark background changing to green waterways and wetlands contributed to the impression that, although the improvements were still in progress, some environmental benefit was already being achieved. All water companies had licences and permits that they were required to comply with to reduce their impact on, and protect, the water environment. The Environment Agency stated that storm overflows were a necessary part of the current sewerage system. They discharged storm sewage (wastewater diluted with rainwater) to rivers or seas during periods of heavy or prolonged rainfall to prevent storm sewage backing up into homes and streets. If they operated within those circumstances and were compliant with their permit, they were not reported and recorded as pollution incidents. Furthermore, water companies were monitored for their compliance with their permits to discharge treated water from sewage treatment works and water treatment works.In 2022, which we understood was the most recent year for which data was available, Wessex Water had an overall EPA rating of two stars (out of a possible four), which meant the “company requires improvement”. Their EPA rating in 2021 was also two stars, in contrast to the period 2011-2020 where they had achieved either three or four stars. The 2022 EPA report stated they performed below target (amber status) for the number of sewerage pollution incidents. Furthermore, their performance was significantly below target (red status) for the number of serious pollution incidents related to sewerage and water supply in 2021 and 2022. We accepted that Wessex Water’s activities in the area of storm overflows would likely result in improvements to their environmental impact. However, because their storm overflow problems had also caused harm to the environment, reflected in the most recent EPA rating, which contradicted the overall impression of the ad, we considered that was significant information which should have been made clear in the ads. We concluded that the ad omitted material information and was therefore likely to mislead. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1, 3.2 (Misleading advertising) and 9.2 (Environmental claims).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Wessex Water Services Ltd t/a Wessex Water to ensure that environmental claims were adequately qualified and that future ads did not omit material information about the environmental impact of Wessex Water.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/wessex-water-services-ltd-a24-1236471-wessex-water-services-ltd.html

ASA Ruling on Happy Koala LLC t/a Happy Mammoth,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of enforcement work on weight loss supplements. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad for Happy Mammoth Hormone Harmony, seen on 1 February 2024, featured an image of a woman in gym attire, with superimposed text “10 kg GONE (and I didn’t even try)”. The caption stated, “I’m 48, and I lost 10 kg without even trying! Day 21: Hormonal weight around the waist and hips is gone”. Additional text below the ad stated, “Feel the difference in 24 hours!” and included a “Learn More” button which directed to a Happy Mammoth product page for “New & Ultra Potent Hormone Harmony”.",The ASA challenged whether:,"1. & 2. Happy Koala LLC t/a Happy Mammoth said that the ad was not among their current sponsored ads on Facebook. They said that if the content did appear in the UK, this was done in error. They confirmed that they were seeking third party regulatory support in relation to making specific health claims for the Happy Mammoth Hormone Harmony product.","1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that health claims were defined as those that stated, suggested or implied that a relationship existed between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health, and that included food supplements. Only health claims that were authorised on the GB (NHC) Register could be made in ads promoting foods, and marketers must also ensure that they met the conditions of use associated with the claims in question. The ASA considered that the claims “10 kg GONE (and I didn’t even try)”, “I lost 10 kg without even trying!” and “Hormonal weight around the waist and hips is gone” suggested a relationship between the Happy Mammoth Hormone Harmony supplement and beneficial health effects on specific physiological functions (namely weight loss), and were therefore specific health claims for the purposes of the Code. We therefore examined whether the advertising claims corresponded to authorised claims on the GB (NHC) Register. We noted that there were no authorised claims in relation to the loss of hormonal weight. That claim was therefore in breach of the Code. There were a limited number of authorised claims relating to weight loss. However, we had not seen any evidence that the claims in the ad corresponded to any of those authorised claims, or that the Happy Mammoth Hormone Harmony supplement met the conditions of use associated with any of those claims. Because the ad included specific health claims that were not authorised on the GB Register, we concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). 2.

Because the ad was for a supplement and made references to an amount of weight loss (10kg), and claimed that weight or fat could be lost from a specific part of the body (“around the waist and hips”), we concluded that the ad breached the Code.

ASA Ruling on Mitchells & Butlers Leisure Retail Ltd t/a Harvester,,"A website for Harvester Restaurants, www.harvester.co.uk, was seen on 22 February 2024. Text stated, “FLAVOUR REWARDS 25% OFF FOOD WHEN YOU SIGN UP TO THE HARVESTER APP AND JOIN THE FLAVOUR FAN CLUB”. Website users could click on a box which stated, “DOWNLOAD NOW”, and the “BENEFITS OF THE APP” were listed underneath. Text stated, “LOVE FLAVOUR. LOVE OUR REWARDS”.

More information was then given on how the Flavour Rewards Loyalty app worked and text stated, “HERE’S FIVE REASONS TO DOWNLOAD THE APP” and the reasons were listed underneath, including text that stated, “25% OFF FOOD Receive a voucher for 25% off food on your next visit when you sign up’. Enjoy all your favourites for less and don’t forget to collect a Flavour Rewards stamp”.",,"Mitchells and Butlers Leisure Retail Ltd t/a Harvester said that the “25% OFF FOOD” promotion was valid on all food and not just main courses. The “25% off mains on your next visit” claim included in the text of the ad, which contradicted the “25% OFF FOOD” in the headline of the ad, was incorrect. They acknowledged this was inconsistent and stated that they had now rectified the error. Harvester said that the promotion was valid for any food item on the following menus: Main Menu, Breakfast and Brunch Menu, Vegetarian and Vegan Menu, Dessert Menu. However, it was not valid on the following menus: Kids’ Menu, Salad Bar, Lunch Menu (2-3 course deal), Evening Menu (2-3 course deal) and Sunday Menu (2-3 course deal), other set menus, buffets, click and collect or delivery through Harvester or third-party partners. It also excluded Bank Holidays, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year’s Eve or Valentine's Day. Harvester explained that if a customer wished to take up the offer, they needed to download and sign up for the Harvester app. Once that process was complete, the relevant voucher was made available to the customer within their “wallet” in the app. The voucher contained the full terms and conditions which the customer could view prior to using the voucher. Harvester stated that they had now made changes to the ad to make the exclusions and restrictions of the offer clearer in the headline of the ad prior to the customer downloading and registering with the app.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that when making claims in their advertising, marketers should state any significant limitations or qualifications and must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information. The ASA considered that the claim “25% OFF FOOD” in the ad would be understood by consumers to mean that all food in Harvester restaurants would be included in the promotion, and further text which stated, “Enjoy all your favourites for less” reinforced this impression. The claim did not indicate that there were any limitations or qualifications to the “25% OFF FOOD” promotion which meant that it did not apply to all food. Additionally, no information regarding qualifications to the offer were included in the ad, nor did the ad indicate that terms and conditions applied. We acknowledged that the terms and conditions, which detailed the limitations and qualifications of the promotion, were provided to the consumer within the voucher after they had downloaded the app. We understood that the promotion had limitations and qualifications. It was not valid for the kids’ menu, salad bar and the 2-3 course Lunch, Evening and Sunday menus, and any other set menus. It also excluded Bank Holidays and many special occasions such as Mother’s Day. We considered that these were significant qualifications and limitations of the promotion, which should have been made clear to the consumer in the ad, prior to them downloading the app. We concluded that the claim in the ad of “25% OFF FOOD” was misleading.

ASA Ruling on Spectrum Awakening,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Spectrum Awakening, a food supplement supplier, seen in March 2024 featured text that stated, ""My 5 yr old son Scout is diagnosed with receptive expressive language disorder and sensory disorder. Until I found Spectrum Awakening he could barely put a sentence together with very limited speech and words and lots of jargon. I was told by his pediatrician [sic] there is nothing we could do except for OT and speech therapy. The first supplement we tried was Power & Focus and within the first three days he started using way more words. Within a week he was speaking sentences. I'm absolutely amazed that I can't wait to order more”. An accompanying video showed a young boy and on-screen text stated, “Before”. The boy spoke but formed no words. He was then shown again with on screen text that stated, “SO THIS HAPPENED” and “A week later taking Power and Focus”. The boy audibly spoke a full sentence and responded to a question. Text at the bottom of the ad stated, “Natural Nutritional Supplements for Autism & ADHD…”.","The ASA challenged whether the claims that the supplement, or substances in it, could help to prevent, treat or cure developmental language disorder, autism and ADHD were in breach of the Code.",,"The ASA was concerned by Spectrum Awakening’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was in breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. Upheld The CAP Code prohibited claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease. Text in the ad described how a boy, who had receptive expressive language disorder and sensory disorder, had limited speech, but within a week of taking the advertised supplement, had formed full sentences. That was supported by the accompanying video that showed the child clearly articulating. The ASA considered that some consumers would understand “receptive expressive language disorder and sensory disorder” as being more commonly known in the UK as developmental language disorder (DLD), where a child had difficulty using and understanding language, and sensory processing disorder (SPD), a neurological condition in children that affected the way the brain processed information from the senses. We understood DLD was a distinct condition in its own right. We understood SPD was not (in 2024) categorised as a standalone condition, but was one that overlapped with a number of other conditions, including autism and ADHD. We considered that the depiction of a child with DLD, and the crediting of the supplement with the sudden improvement in the speech of that child, was likely to be interpreted as a claim to treat or cure that condition. Further to that, we understood that SPD and other language difficulties were often associated with autism and ADHD. The depiction of a child with those traits, in conjunction with the claims that the supplements were “Natural Nutritional Supplements for Autism & ADHD” and that the supplement improved the child’s speech, were therefore also likely to be interpreted as a claim to treat or cure autism and ADHD. Finally the ad included the brand name “Spectrum Awakening”. The full medical term for autism was autism spectrum disorder. We understood that ADHD was also sometimes described as a spectrum disorder. We considered that in the context of the explicit and inferred claims to assist with autism and ADHD, the name “Spectrum Awakening” would therefore also be interpreted as a claim that the products sold under that brand name could help with those conditions. The ad claimed that Spectrum Awakening products could help with DLD, autism and ADHD, which for the purposes of the Code fell within the definition of claims to prevent, treat or cure human disease. On that basis we therefore concluded the ad breached the Code The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Spectrum Awakening to ensure their future advertising did not make claims that food could prevent, treat or cure human disease.

As they lay on the floor they said, “For £32.95 you too can leave bottomless brunch like this”. The caption on the post stated, “That’s a deal I say ;))) #canterbury #fail #marketing #viral #helpme”.",,"1. The Big Table Group Ltd t/a Las Iguanas said that the ad was intended to be a humorous and theatrical recreation of other videos involving people falling over, in keeping with a common theme developed by the Social Media Coordinator (who appears in the video) on the @lasiguanascanterbury account. They said the theme was intended to be a fun and creative way to catch the attention of the viewer. They had not intended for the ad to encourage or condone excessive drinking but, in hindsight, understood how it could be perceived this way. 2. Las Iguanas confirmed that the individual who featured in the video was under 25 years of age at the time the ads were seen. She was a part-time Social Media Coordinator for the Canterbury restaurant and was selected to feature in the ad because of her popularity on social media and the restaurant’s customer base. While they highlighted that she was not drinking, they accepted that she was the only person visible in the ad which was promoting a bottomless brunch.

Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be socially responsible and not contain anything that was likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that were unwise, including encouraging excessive drinking. The ASA understood that the ad was based on a common theme amongst the individuals’ videos on the @lasiguanascanterbury account which would show a person falling over and transition to the restaurant where the falling motion was recreated and continued. The ad showed the individual dramatically falling over with a drink in her hand, saying “For £32.95 you too can leave bottomless brunch like this” while lying on the floor.

ASA Ruling on The Drop Supplements Ltd t/a Drop,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld","A paid-for Facebook ad for Drop Supplements, a food supplement supplier, seen in January 2024 stated, “Get ready to experience a truly unique elixir that will take your mental performance to the next level…”. Beneath that an image of a bottle next to a mushroom was shown. The bottle had the text, “Happy Mind” on the label. Text to the top right of the bottle stated, “Designed to make you feel better”. Text beneath the bottle said, “FOR PEOPLE WITH STRESS ANXIETY BRAIN FOG ADHD…. Happy Mind Drops - your new secret adaptogen against stress! Prepare yourself to unleash your true potential and banish your mental barriers.”",The ASA challenged whether:,"1. The Drop Supplements Ltd t/a Drop Supplements said that their ads featuring “Happy Mind” made no direct or implied statements about curing, treating or preventing ailments or diseases. 2. They stated that the claims, “take your mental performance to the next level”, “FOR PEOPLE WITH […] BRAIN FOG” and “banish your mental barriers” were part of a broader lifestyle message that promoted positive thinking and mental resilience. Therefore, they believed no direct or implied health claims had been made. In addition they explained that the “Terms of Service” on their website had a section called, “Supplement Disclaimer and Advertising Clarification” which listed the full terms and conditions. One of the conditions stated their supplements were, “not intended to cure or prevent any diseases.” 3. They said that the product “Happy Mind” would be interpreted in all advertising as a supplement and not a specific health claim that inferred a preventative treatment for any medical condition. They explained that “Happy Mind Drops” was a trademarked term. The phrase was created to combine the product name, “Happy Mind” with the brand oral pipette administration, “The Drop”. They said, further, that the product used essential vitamins and minerals, such as B5 and zinc, which were known to stimulate mental performance and cognitive function and they had sought experienced food labelling advice regarding that. They provided a copy of an email from a food labelling advisory firm which stated that if a small amount of vitamin B5 and zinc was added to the product, it was permissible to use “COGNITIVE FUNCTION” and “MENTAL PERFORMANCE on the front”. The email further stated if they had zinc, then “For Wellbeing” and “For Cognitive Function” would be acceptable as long as the full claim appeared on the product label.","1. & 3. Upheld The CAP Code stated that claims which stated or implied a food prevented, treated or cured human disease were not acceptable in marketing communications for foods or food supplement products.The ad stated, “FOR PEOPLE WITH STRESS ANXIETY […] ADHD” and “your new secret adaptogen against stress!” The ASA considered that those claims would be interpreted as explicit references that the product could help with those conditions, and therefore were claims that it could prevent, treat or cure human disease. Further to that the ad stated, “take your mental performance to the next level…”, “banish your mental barriers” and “FOR PEOPLE WITH […] BRAIN FOG”. We considered that they could be interpreted by some consumers as health claims to help people feel better and assist with mental performance. However, in the wider context of the ad, and the separate explicit references to stress, anxiety and ADHD, we considered the claims would be understood by most consumers as references to helping with symptoms of those conditions, and therefore they were also implied claims that the product could prevent, treat or cure human disease. The ad further displayed the product name, “Happy Mind” and used the term “Happy Mind Drops”, both of which indicated the cessation of a negative mental state. We considered that in isolation those claims could be understood by consumers as a health claim relating to mood, and therefore would have needed to be accompanied by a related authorised specific health claim. However, in the context of the wider ad and the explicit and inferred claims to assist with stress, anxiety and ADHD the terms “Happy Mind” and “Happy Mind Drops” would be interpreted as references that the product could help with those conditions, and therefore they were claims to prevent, treat or cure human disease. We recognised that “Happy Mind” was the product name and “Happy Mind Drops” was a trademarked term. However, the requirement that advertising claims made for foods and food supplements must not state or imply a food prevented, treated or cured human disease also applied to product names, including trademarks. On those points, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 2. Upheld The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health, and required that only health claims authorised on the applicable register, which in this case was the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB (NHC) Register), were permitted in marketing communications for foods. Some flexibility could be exercised in rewording authorised claims, provided that the reworded claim was likely to have the same meaning for consumers as the authorised claim. Marketers must also ensure that they met the conditions of use associated with the claims in question. As referenced above, we considered that in the context of the ad’s references to stress, anxiety and ADHD, the claims “take your mental performance to the next level”, “FOR PEOPLE WITH […] BRAIN FOG” and “banish your mental barriers” would be understood by most consumers as claims that the product could prevent, treat or cure human disease. However, some consumers might understand those claims as specific health claims that Happy Mind could boost mental performance and help with focus and concentration. We considered the claims would likely also be understood in that way if they had been presented in isolation and absent of the wider context in the ad under investigation. Drop Supplements said the Happy Mind product contained zinc and vitamin B5 in sufficient quantities that their advertising could include authorised health claims about those nutrients. There was an authorised health claim for zinc that, “zinc contributes to normal cognitive function” and for vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) that, “Pantothenic acid contributes to normal mental performance”. We noted however that the ad did not include those claims. We further did not consider that the claims “take your mental performance to the next level”, “FOR PEOPLE WITH […] BRAIN FOG” and “banish your mental barriers” would be interpreted in the same way by consumers but rather would be seen as going beyond the meaning of the authorised claims. Additionally, the claims in the ad were attributed to the product overall rather than to the specific nutrients named in the authorised claims. We also had not been provided with evidence that the product contained sufficient quantities of zinc and pantothenic acid to meet the conditions of use for the authorised claims. Therefore, we concluded that those claims breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals).","The claims must not appear again in their current form. We told The Drop Supplements Ltd t/a Drop Supplements to ensure their future advertising did not make claims that food, including food supplements, could prevent, treat or cure human conditions that, for the purposes of the Code fall within the definition of human disease, and not to make health claims for foods if they were not listed as authorised in the GB (NHC) Register.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/the-drop-supplements-ltd-a24-1231792-the-drop-supplements-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on air up GmbH,,"A paid-for YouTube ad for air up, a water bottle company, seen in February and March 2024, showed a man, from behind, urinating into a lake in a park, while a woman walked past carrying a child and a man shovelled snow. A voice-over stated, “Air up takes your water intake to new levels, by flavouring water through scent. We solved daily hydration for this guy, the side effects, less sugary drinks, a healthier lifestyle, and well, this, we couldn’t solve this, but he’ll take care of that […] You’ll be drinking a whole lot more water.”","The complainants, who believed the ad condoned anti-social and potentially unlawful behaviour, challenged whether it was irresponsible.","Air up GmbH t/a air up stated that as a company they promoted decency and morality and did not take their social responsibility obligations lightly. They did not believe the ad condoned or encouraged anti-social behaviour, it merely represented a human biological function in a humorous and non-offensive way. They said the ad presented a fictional scenario in a humorous way and that an audience would be able to distinguish fiction from reality. The ad attempted to convey that hydration was important, even if that resulted in sometimes needing to empty one’s bladder when it was not the right time and place. The scenario presented was not intended to shock the audience; it was merely portraying a situation that most people would be familiar with. They believed the other characters featured in the ad demonstrated that they found the behaviour unacceptable.They had not received any direct complaints about the ad and expressed caution about taking the impressions or feelings of a small group of complainants as being representative of the whole population.They said the ad was no longer being broadcast. Google Ireland Ltd, the service providing the ad platform, confirmed that the ad had been served through Google Ads, a self-administered system. They said that under the terms agreed to by advertisers, it was the advertiser’s responsibility to abide by applicable laws and regulations, including the CAP Code.","The CAP Code required that marketing communications must contain nothing that was likely to condone or encourage anti-social behaviour and to ensure advertising was prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The ASA acknowledged air up’s comments that the ad was intended to highlight the consequences of drinking more water in a humorous and fictitious way. However, the scenario took place in a real-world setting and depicted a male prominently and publicly urinating in a park, which we considered people would view as being anti-social behaviour, as well as potentially unlawful in the UK. Furthermore, although not explicitly depicted in the ad, because the protagonist was standing in the open whilst urinating, it was implied that his genitalia would have been exposed and potentially visible to others in the park. Although the other characters shown in the ad, including a mother carrying a crying child, seemed displeased at the sight of the man urinating, he appeared comfortable with his actions, made no attempt to hide what he was doing or find a more discrete location, and expressed a sigh of relief whilst urinating. The ad also focused on the man’s urine stream, which was explicitly visible and shown from different angles. We therefore considered that by trivialising the act of public urination, the ad condoned anti-social behaviour. On that basis, we concluded it was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising) and 4.4 (Harm and offence).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Air up GmbH t/a air up to ensure their ads were prepared responsibly and did not condone anti-social behaviour in the future.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/air-up-gmbh-g24-1236666-air-up-gmbh.html
ASA Ruling on Apollo Future Technology Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on the promotion of electronic cigarettes through affiliate schemes, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 26 June 2024.","A website for Apollo Vapes UK, www.apolloecigs.co.uk, an electronic cigarette brand, seen on 17 January 2024, featured a page titled “Affiliate Program” that stated, “1.Online Affiliates If you have a website (or other online marketing channels) that can help promote Apollo products and send traffic to our website, you can use your website to indirectly generate sales. You will receive your own unique URL which will automatically track all sales generated from your website. We even provide you with banner ads and text links that you can just choose, copy & paste”. Text below stated, “Click here to create an Apollo affiliate account”.","The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code by irresponsibly encouraging the promotion of e-cigarettes and related components online, because unlicensed nicotine-containing e-liquids and their components could not be promoted in online media.","Apollo Future Technology Ltd t/a Apollo Vapes UK said they had removed the affiliate page from their website.They said their UK affiliate programme in the UK worked with product review websites, which were for adult vape users. They reviewed products and ranked them. They did not believe they breached UK regulations by allowing those sites to review their products, but would stop working with them if that was the case.","CAP Code rule 22.12 reflected a legislative ban contained in the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 (TRPR) on the advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes in certain media. The rule stated that, except for media targeted exclusively to the trade, marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components, which were not licensed as medicines, were not permitted in newspapers, magazines and periodicals, or in online media and some other forms of electronic media. The ASA had previously found ads promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes on public social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Discord and TikTok in breach of CAP Code rule 22.12. The ad was not for specific named e-cigarette or vaping products, and as such we considered it did not have the direct effect of promoting unlicensed nicotine-containing e-cigarettes. We therefore assessed whether the ad had the indirect effect of promoting such products. The Apollo Affiliate Program webpage featured linked text that individuals could click to enter their details to become an online affiliate. It also set out the benefits of becoming an affiliate which included the money they could make, receiving a unique URL to track sales, as well as banners and images provided by Apollo to add to the affiliate websites. The webpage stated, “If you have a website (or other online marketing channels) that can help promote Apollo products and send traffic to our website, you can use your website to indirectly generate sales”. We considered the reference to “other online marketing channels” included social media and therefore the ad encouraged people to become Apollo Affiliates, who in turn would promote the sale of e-cigarettes and their components on the advertiser’s behalf on social media. Consequently, the restriction that applied to online media under rule 22.12 was applicable. We therefore considered that this meant the ad had the indirect effect of promoting the sale of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components, which were not licensed as medicines in online media, by means of the affiliate programme. We further considered that by encouraging people to promote the sale of such products on social media, the ad incited prospective affiliates to breach the Code and the legislative ban contained in the TRPR. Because the ad had the indirect effect of promoting e-cigarettes, which were not licensed as medicines in non-permitted media, and irresponsibly incited people to break the law, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 1.10 (Legality), and 22.12 (Electronic cigarettes).","The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Apollo Future Technology Ltd t/a Apollo Vapes UK to ensure that future marketing communications must not have the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components, which were not licensed as medicines, for example through the advertising of affiliate schemes.

ASA Ruling on Femtech Healthcare Ltd t/a KeyForHer,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ads making claims about the treatment of symptoms of the menopause. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Facebook ad for Key, a supplement company, seen on 5 April 2024, included a caption that stated, “Use code TRYKEY for 20% off + Free Shipping on your first one-time purchase of Key For Peri + Menopause”. The ad featured a video of a woman talking about the product that included the claims, “It’s the most comprehensive menopause support supplement that’s out there, it also works for perimenopause, it also works for post-menopause”; “[F]rom helping with mood, to brain fog, to hot flushes, to night sweats, to just all over, feeling so much better, more energy, and better sleep, that’s what every woman wants”; “[J]ust try a box for a month […] see how you get on first, and let us know, I bet you you’ll see a difference” and “[I]t also supports your immunity, your bone health, your heart health, and cognitive function”.",The ASA challenged whether:,"1. & 2. Femtech Healthcare Ltd t/a KeyForHer said the ad did not use the words “treat”, “cure” or “prevent” in relation to symptoms of menopause or perimenopause. They said the purpose of the ad had been to provide information about the ingredients that were contained in the Key Peri + Menopause product, and their potential benefits for general health and wellbeing, with a particular focus on immune system support, bone health, heart health and cognitive function. They said Key Peri + Menopause contained a blend of vitamins, minerals and botanical extracts that had been chosen for their specific health-promoting properties. They provided a list of the ingredients and highlighted authorised claims on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register) relating to those substances. They also provided an overview of the other ingredients and the studies that had been conducted on them for their health effects. KeyForHer also said they had worked alongside doctors and specialists in this area to highlight the benefits of lifestyle changes, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), complementary therapies and supplements in managing symptoms of perimenopause, menopause and post-menopause. KeyForHer said they were committed to complying with the CAP Code and that upon being contacted, had removed the ad until the issue had been resolved with the ASA.","The CAP Code stated that claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease were prohibited for foods. The ad was for the “Key for Peri + Menopause” supplement. It stated, “It’s the most comprehensive menopause support supplement that’s out there, it also works for perimenopause, it also works for post-menopause”; and “[F]rom helping with mood, to brain fog, to hot flushes, to night sweats, to just all over, feeling so much better, more energy, and better sleep, that’s what every woman wants”. We considered consumers would understand these to be claims that the product could treat symptoms of perimenopause and menopause, namely brain fog, hot flushes and night sweats as well as helping to resolve low energy and poor-quality sleep. The ad therefore made claims that the supplements could resolve symptoms of perimenopause and menopause. The ad also made the claim, “just try a box for a month […] see how you get on first, and let us know, I bet you you’ll see a difference”, which we also considered would be understood by consumers as meaning that the product could help improve the aforementioned symptoms of perimenopause and menopause. Such claims were, for the purposes of the Code, claims to treat disease, which were prohibited for food and food supplements. We welcomed KeyForHer’s assurance that the ad had been removed. However, because at the time the ad was seen it made claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure symptoms of perimenopause and menopause, we concluded it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health, and required that only health claims authorised on the applicable register, which in this case was the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register), were permitted in marketing communications for foods. The Code also required that general health claims, which were claims that referred to the general benefits of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health-related well-being, must be accompanied by a specific authorised health claim. The ad stated, “it also supports your immunity […] and cognitive function”. We considered the references to immunity and cognitive function would be understood by consumers to mean the food supplements contained ingredients that could help with the function of the immune system and with cognitive function. These were therefore specific health claims for the purposes of the Code. The claim “contributes to the normal function of the immune system” was authorised on the GB Register in relation to vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D, folate, zinc, selenium and iron. The claim “contributes to normal cognitive function” was authorised on the GB Register in relation to zinc, iron and iodine. We understood that the product contained sufficient quantities of all these vitamins and minerals to meet the conditions of use for both of these authorised claims, and therefore could be used in advertising for it. However, health claims must be presented clearly and without exaggeration. Marketers could exercise some flexibility in rewording claims, provided that the reworded claim was likely to have the same meaning for consumers as the authorised health claim. Plus, that the aim of the rewording was to aid consumer understanding and taking into account factors such as linguistic and cultural variations and the target population. We considered that “supports” in the ad’s claim, and “contributes to” in the authorised claim, would have the same meaning to consumers. However, we considered the ad’s claim “supports your immunity” would have a different meaning to the authorised claim “contributes to the normal function of the immune system”. The latter made clear that the nutrients played a role in the normal function of the immune system, whereas by removing the reference to “normal” function, the claim in the ad implied they boosted the immune system. We therefore considered the claim exaggerated the authorised claim and was unlikely to have the same meaning for consumers as that of the authorised health claim. The claim “supports your immunity” therefore breached the Code. For the same reason, we considered “supports cognitive function” also breached the Code. Additionally, health claims in ads must be clearly attributed to the specific nutrient named in the authorised claim to reflect its full meaning. The claims in the ad did not attribute the health claims to any of the nutrients referenced above, and instead implied that it related to the product as a whole, which contained other vitamins and nutrients. We considered the claim “it also supports your immunity […] and cognitive function” did not accurately reflect the wording of the authorised health claims for vitamin A, vitamin B12, vitamin D, folate, zinc, selenium, iron, vitamin C, or iodine. We therefore concluded it breached the Code. We then assessed which claims were general health claims, and which therefore must be accompanied by an authorised specific health claim on the GB Register. We considered the claim “it also supports your bone health, your heart health” would be understood as general benefits of the product for the overall good health of bones and the heart. We considered it was therefore a general health claim for the purposes of the Code and would only be acceptable if accompanied by authorised health claims relating to specific beneficial physiological functions of bone and the heart. However, the claim was not accompanied by relevant, authorised specific health claims, and we concluded it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1, 15.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Femtech Healthcare Ltd t/a KeyForHer not to state or imply their food supplements could prevent, treat or cure human disease. We also told them to ensure any specific health claims made in their future advertising were authorised on the GB Register and complied with the conditions of use for those claims, and that any general health claims needed to be accompanied by a relevant authorised specific health claim.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/femtech-healthcare-ltd-a24-1241024-femtech-healthcare-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Lyma Life Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Instagram ad for the LYMA Laser, a home beauty device, seen in January 2024, compared the product to LED masks. The headline claim stated, “Ok wasting your money on LED masks? Then the LYMA Laser is probably not for you”. The caption stated, “The world’s most powerful home beauty device is 100x more effective than LED masks and able to turn back the aging clock, transforming skin in weeks, in your own home”. It contained a list, bulleted by tick emojis, that included “100x more powerful than LED”, “Thousands of transformational 5 [star emoji] reviews” and “Anti-aging. Wrinkles. Skin Elasticity. Scars. Redness. Pigmentation”.","The complainant challenged whether the following efficacy claims, which compared the LYMA Laser to LED and other beauty devices, were misleading and could be substantiated:","1. Lyma Life Ltd said that the “most powerful” claim was based on the power output and power density of the device. They explained that their internal Compliance team conducted monthly research on the beauty device market, monitoring the power specifications of any new devices on the market and any current product updates. The research was conducted online, mainly relying on websites that they considered to be the four biggest online retailers of beauty devices. They provided a table which they said identified the five most powerful light therapy devices for at home use, including the LYMA device, with categories for wavelength, total power and power per cm squared (power density). The table showed that the LYMA Laser was the most powerful device with 500 mW total power output and 62.5 mW power per cm squared. 2. & 3. Lyma Life explained that the claims that compared the LYMA Laser device with LED were based on the different properties of laser and LED light. They explained that laser light was a coherent, polarised light form, which allowed it to reach the base layers of the skin, while LED light generally had lower power output and emitted light in an omnidirectional pattern such that experts estimated that 95% of the light bounces off the surface of the skin. They stated that the LYMA Laser, which operated at 808 nm wavelength, was therefore more effective than equivalent LED wavelengths. They supplied two independent peer-reviewed in vitro studies which they believed supported the claims that compared their device with LED masks and other LED powered devices. They also supplied three peer reviewed articles that cited one of the studies. Lyma Life said that the near-infrared laser in the LYMA device was sufficiently novel to mean that there were not many clinical studies which examined such lasers as a source of photobiomodulation. They said that existing clinical studies assessing the efficacy of LED based light therapy were either quasi-quantitative or qualitative in nature, and it was therefore impossible to compare them with each other or against their own data for the LYMA device. They added that those studies were industry sponsored and had methodological flaws which made them unreliable. In contrast, they believed that in vitro and pre-clinical studies were the highest quality studies available on the subject; they believed such studies were rigorous in methodological quality and designed to account for confounding variables. They highlighted that extensive comparisons of laser and LED based bio-stimulation had been conducted across in vitro and pre-clinical studies. Furthermore, they explained the use of a near-infrared laser to treat wrinkles and lines was a recent discovery, and therefore the evidence supplied related to the wound healing process. They said the results were transferrable to skin rejuvenation because, in essence, the skin underwent the same physiological process.","The claim “world’s most powerful home beauty device” appeared twice in the ad: by itself, and within a sentence that referenced the effectiveness of the device, specifically its ability to “turn back the aging clock” and “transform […] skin in weeks”. The ASA considered consumers would understand the claim to mean that the LYMA Laser was the strongest and most effective device for treating the visible signs of aging when compared to all other home beauty devices. That impression was reinforced by the bulleted list underneath the claim which referred to “thousands of transformational 5 [star emoji] reviews” and the effects of aging on skin, such as “Wrinkles”, “Skin Elasticity” and “Pigmentation”, as well as a direct reference to “Anti-aging”, in addition to other skin conditions such as “Scars” and “Redness”. In addition, we considered that the headline claim, “Ok wasting your money on LED masks? Then the LYMA Laser is probably not for you” further implied that the LYMA Laser delivered superior results to all other LED masks on the market. We therefore expected Lyma Life to hold objective evidence to support the claim that their device was the most effective on the market for treating the visible signs of aging and the other skin conditions listed in the ad. In support of the claim, Lyma Life provided a table that they said identified the five most powerful light therapy devices for at-home use. For each device, there was information on its wavelength, total power and power density (power per cm squared). We assessed the data supplied in the table; it showed that the LYMA Laser had 25% and 56% more power density respectively than two home beauty devices that were identified as being the next “most powerful” on the market. We understood that the technology of the LYMA Laser was based on a process called photobiomodulation ? i.e., the use of low-level light energy to trigger photochemical changes in cells. However, the efficacy of that process in such devices was dependent on a combination of other factors, such as the wavelength of the light source, energy dose, energy density and the duration of application. We understood that power density was not, on its own, a measure of the performance capability of each of the listed devices. For that reason, we considered that the evidence provided was not relevant to the way in which consumers would interpret “most powerful” within the context of the ad and was, therefore, insufficient to substantiate the claim. In any case, we noted that the table compared the LYMA Laser with four other at-home light therapy devices. We considered that there were many other home beauty light therapy devices on the market and that the data provided to us was, therefore, far from an exhaustive list of home beauty devices available to UK consumers. Because we were only provided with data for four other devices, we considered the evidence did not demonstrate that the LYMA Laser was the most powerful home beauty device on the market. We acknowledged Lyma Life’s comments that they regularly monitored the specifications of other devices offered by the companies seen in the comparison table to ensure they accounted for any product upgrades. However, we understood that the different websites that they relied upon for their research were inconsistent in the data that was available for each of the devices. We noted that the table did not include all of the data points for every listed device. For example, we were not provided with information related to the total power of two of the devices, nor were we provided with the power per cm squared of another of the listed devices. We understood that the comparative claim was based on the power density of the devices, and because we were not provided with that information for every device, we considered the evidence provided was not sufficient to substantiate the claim. Furthermore, we did not receive evidence in the form of controlled studies on humans demonstrating the superior efficacy of the LYMA device to reduce the visible signs of aging, scarring or redness. Because we considered consumers would interpret the claim in terms of the device’s efficacy, rather than its physical power output, we concluded that the evidence did not adequately substantiate the claim “world’s most powerful beauty device” as it was likely to be understood by consumers and that the ad therefore was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.33 (Comparative advertising) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health related products and beauty products). We considered that consumers would understand the claims “100x more effective than LED masks” and “100x more powerful than LED” as direct comparisons between the advertised product and LED masks and LED-powered beauty devices with the same intended purpose. Within the context of the ad, which referred to the device’s ability to “transform” skin and specifically referenced wrinkles, skin elasticity, scars, redness and pigmentation, we considered the claims would be understood to mean that the LYMA Laser was 100 times more effective than LED masks at treating those areas and the laser technology within the device was 100 times more effective than a LED device. We therefore expected the advertiser to hold evidence in the form of controlled experimental human studies demonstrating that the LYMA Laser was 100 times more effective than at-home LED devices. The advertiser supplied two peer reviewed studies to support the claims and three further peer reviewed studies which cited one of those studies. However, because those three further studies were only provided in support of the quality of the first study supplied by the advertiser, and were not directly relevant to the claims seen in the ad, we could not take them into account. We examined the first study supplied by the advertiser. The in vitro study compared the application of two different light sources ? a red light and a near infrared light ? at three different energy densities on human keratinocyte cells, the principal cell type in outermost layer of skin, and fibroblast cells from mice, which are cells found in connective tissue. The aim of the study was to determine the energy dose and wavelength of light most effective at accelerating the wound healing process in those two specific cell types. In assessing the study, we noted that the light sources were from two different diode lasers ? a 655-nm diode laser was used for the red-light source and an 808-nm diode laser was used for the near infrared-light source. Because the claims in the ad directly compared the performance of the LYMA Laser with LED, and the study only compared the performance of two different lasers, we considered that it was not relevant to the claims made in the ad. Furthermore, the study was designed to observe the wound healing process of cells and did not assess the function of cells in terms of anti-aging processes or for the cosmetic treatment of redness, pigmentation and scarring. We noted, from Lyma Life’s response, that they believed the wound healing process carried out by human cells was sufficiently similar to that which would be necessary to reduce the appearance of wrinkles, redness, pigmentation and scarring, and consequently, the study could be used to demonstrate the effect of the light sources on the listed cosmetic conditions in the ad. However, we were not provided with evidence to demonstrate that was the case, and as such, we considered the study was not related to the cosmetic treatment claims seen in the ad. In addition, we noted that the study had been conducted in vitro and that the sample, in part, relied on mice cells. While we acknowledged that in vitro tests could be useful for research, they could not always be extrapolated to suggest any effects seen would be identical or even similar in vivo. We therefore considered that the results of an in vitro assessment, partially using animal cells, were not sufficient to substantiate the efficacy of the device in human subjects. We then examined the second study supplied by the advertiser. The in vitro study compared the application of a laser light source (helium-neon laser) and thermal light source (halogen lamp) on human white blood cells to understand the immunosuppressive effect of the light sources; namely, whether they could partially or completely suppress the cells’ immune response, which would be useful, for example, in delaying the rejection of an organ transplant. However, we understood that the physiological process for suppressing the cells’ immune response was unrelated to the process required to improve skin elasticity and reduce wrinkles, scars, redness and pigmentation. We therefore considered that the measured outcomes and results of that study were unrelated to the efficacy or performance of the LYMA Laser in relation to the beauty claims seen in the ad. Furthermore, the study was performed using a gas laser with a wavelength of 632.8 nm and a thermal halogen lamp. In contrast, we understood that the LYMA Laser was a near infrared laser with a wavelength of 808 nm and the comparative claims in the ad related to LED devices, rather than halogen lamps. Because the devices used in the study were not equivalent to the laser and LED devices referenced in the ad, we considered the results of the study were not representative of the performance of the LYMA Laser or LED home beauty devices. Again, we noted that the study was conducted in vitro, and consequently, was not sufficient to substantiate the efficacy of the device in human subjects. We therefore considered that study was also insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of the LYMA device. We concluded that we had not received sufficient evidence to substantiate that the LYMA Laser was “100x more effective than LED masks” or that the technology used by the LYMA Laser was “100x more powerful than LED” and that therefore the claims were misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.33 (Comparative advertising) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear in its current form. We told Lyma Life Ltd to ensure they did not make claims about the efficacy or performance of the LYMA Laser in the absence of adequate substantiation.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/lyma-life-ltd-a24-1228550-lyma-life-ltd.html

"ASA Ruling on Rejuvit Labs, LLC","This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ads making claims about the treatment of symptoms of the menopause. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","Two paid-for Facebook ads for Rejuvit, a supplement company, seen on 5 April 2024: a. A paid-for Facebook ad for Rejuvit Ageless Vitality, included a caption that stated “Get Up To 35% Off Rejuvit Menopause Relief”. The ad included a quote from a customer that stated, “I’m telling you, once you start, you’ll keep seeing results. Around 2-8 weeks after my first capsule, I already had extra room in my pants (everyone was asking how I lost weight), I felt more energized, and the hot flashes [sic] were gone! […] I just keep feeling better, healthier, and happier.” Further text stated, “Not just about maintaining shape, but unlocking clarity, energy, and daily consistency […] It’s not too late to take charge of our well-being. Let’s prioritize our health”. b. A paid-for Facebook ad for Rejuvit Graceful Ageing, included a long caption that began “I’m 55 […] Menopause sucks so bad! Not to mention the hot flashes [sic] and joint pain I’ve had for over 7 years […] the tummy or gut area is so bloated and big […] That’s precisely how Katy felt when she entered menopause"". Further text stated, “Many women think weight gain and muffin tops during menopause are typical and can’t be stopped. Along with bloating, low energy, and digestive issues”. The ad included testimonials from customers who described how it helped with various symptoms of the menopause, including, “I have an energy level like you can’t imagine. The weight gain is getting better, but the bloat is what I noticed a significant difference in”; and “My first week was crazy good […] And the weight… went from 193 to 187”. Further text stated, “Curcumin is a phytoestrogen (a plant source of estrogen [sic]) that helps women to rebalance their estrogen [sic] levels naturally […] It is also a natural antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory herb that supports weight control, digestion, joint pain & cools hot flashes [sic] […] Magnesium Glycinate leaves provide an even more potent anti-inflammatory benefit from Curcumin […] During menopause, Magnesium levels drop severely, leading to anxiety, mood swings, and brain fog. A daily dose of Magnesium Glycinate replenishes the body and helps women with low energy feel recharged in the morning […] Probiotics are great for strengthening the gut and populating it with good bacteria. A drop in estrogen [sic] levels after 30s can cause bad bacteria to grow quicker in the gut (which can also lead to gut inflammation and ‘leaky gut’). This is why it’s common to experience bloating, weight gain, and other digestive issues in our 40-60s. We’ve added unique fat-neutralizing probiotic strains – like L. Gasseri & B. Lactis – that have been studied to impact bloating and stubborn fat”. Further text stated, “By combining these 3 ingredients, Rejuvit Menopause Relief helps to: 1. Manage weight gain. 2. Reduce MenoPot 3. Manage bloating 4. Ease hot flashes [sic]/night sweats 5. Give a burst of new energy throughout the day 6. Support quality sleep 7. Promotes healthier metabolism 8. Soothe obesity-causing inflammation 9. Slow down fat accumulation”. The ad contained an image that included a bottle of the product. Text above the image stated, “1 BOTTLE shrinks meno-belly”. Further text stated, “Reduces bloating and fluid retention in 1 to 3 days; Eliminates hot flashes [sic] in as little as 4 to 7 days; Induces deep, uninterrupted sleep in 5 to 7 days; Starts shifting hormonal weight in 15 to 30 days”.",The ASA challenged whether the ads included claims about food supplements which were prohibited by the Code:,,"The ASA was concerned by Rejuvit Labs LLC t/a Rejuvit Graceful Ageing, Rejuvit Ageless Vitality’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code stated that claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease were prohibited for foods. Ad (a), from Rejuvit Ageless Vitality, was for the “Rejuvit Menopause Relief” supplement. The ad included a customer testimonial that stated, “Around 2-8 weeks after my first capsule, I already had extra room in my pants (everyone was asking how I lost weight), I felt more energized, and the hot flashes [sic] were gone […] I just keep feeling better, healthier, and happier”. The ad further stated, “Not just about maintaining shape, but unlocking clarity, energy, and daily consistency […] It’s not too late to take charge of our well-being. Let’s prioritize our health”. We considered that consumers would understand these to be claims that the product could treat symptoms of menopause, including resolving menopause-related weight gain, increasing energy levels and stopping hot flashes [sic]. Ad (a) therefore made claims that Rejuvit Ageless Vitality supplements could resolve symptoms of menopause. Ad (b), from Rejuvit Graceful Ageing, opened with the claim “I’m 55 […] Menopause sucks so bad! Not to mention the hot flashes [sic] and joint pain I’ve had for over 7 years. […] the tummy or gut area is so bloated and big […] That’s precisely how Katy felt when she entered menopause"". Further text stated, “Many women think weight gain and muffin tops during menopause are typical and can’t be stopped. Along with bloating, low energy, and digestive issues”. We considered this would be understood by consumers to mean that the Rejuvit Graceful Ageing supplements could be used to treat symptoms of the menopause, in particular weight gain, bloating, low energy levels and digestive issues. These claims were further emphasised with other testimonials from customers that stated, “I have an energy level like you can’t imagine. The weight gain is getting better, but the bloat is what I noticed a significant difference in”; and “My first week was crazy good […] And the weight… went from 193 to 187”. We considered consumers would further understand these to be references to the Rejuvit Graceful Ageing supplements being used to treat symptoms of the menopause. The ad included a list of ingredients that were in the supplements, and stated how they helped with symptoms of the menopause, including stopping hot flushes, aiding in weight loss, improving mood swings, rebalancing oestrogen levels, and stopping brain fog. We further considered these were claims to treat and cure such symptoms of the menopause. Lastly, the image in the ad stated, “1 BOTTLE shrinks meno-belly”. Further text stated, “Reduces bloating and fluid retention in 1 to 3 days; Eliminates hot flashes [sic] in as little as 4 to 7 days; Induces deep, uninterrupted sleep in 5 to 7 days; Starts shifting hormonal weight in 15 to 30 days”. Those were also claims that the supplement could treat symptoms of the menopause. Both ads included a range of claims that the supplements could treat or cure symptoms of the menopause, both in general terms and in relation to specifically described symptoms. Such claims were, for the purposes of the Code, claims to treat disease, which were prohibited for food and food supplements. The ads therefore breached the Code. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code stated that health claims that referred to a rate or amount of weight loss were not permitted when made in relation to a food. Claims that consuming a food or food supplement could result in weight loss were health claims. Ad (a) stated, “Around 2-8 weeks after my first capsule, I already had extra room in my pants”. We considered consumers would understand the claim to mean that consuming Rejuvit Ageless Vitality supplements would result in weight loss within two to eight weeks. That claim therefore related to a rate of weight loss. Ad (b) stated, “And the weight … went from 193 to 187” which we considered would be understood by consumers as meaning that as a result of consuming Rejuvit Graceful Ageing supplements, that person’s weight had gone from 193 lbs to 187 lbs. The ad also stated “Start shifting hormonal weight in 15 to 30 days”, which we considered consumers would understand as referring to a rate of weight loss. Because the ads included health claims, made in relation to food that referred to a rate and an amount of weight loss, we concluded they breached the Code. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.6 (Food, food supplements and associated health and nutrition claims).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Rejuvit Labs LLC t/a Rejuvit Graceful Ageing, Rejuvit Ageless Vitality not to state or imply their food supplements could prevent, treat or cure human disease, which for the purposes of the Code included claims to treat or cure the symptoms of menopause. We also told them to ensure their ads for foods did not include health claims that referred to a rate or amount of weight loss.

ASA Ruling on BetterMe Ltd,,"A paid-for TikTok ad for Better Me, @BetterMe: Health Coaching, seen on 16 March 2024 featured a video of a muscular man posing and looking at the reflection of his bare chest in a mirror. Small text at the bottom of the screen stated, “*Actor portrayal”. The voice-over said, “I look like this and I didn’t even go to the gym.” Another scene showed the man speaking into a microphone saying, “About 28 days ago I started Better Me’s 28-day Calisthenic Challenge. I just finished up and I can say it is one of the greatest workout plans on the entire market. They give you a step-by step guide for all the workouts so it’s perfect for any level. Make sure you guys download at the link below.” The ad showed the man doing press-ups and examples of the exercises.","The complainant, who believed the ad implied that viewers could obtain a similar physique in 28 days using the Better Me 28-day Calisthenic Challenge programme, challenged whether the ad was misleading.","BetterMe Ltd said the ad did not claim that the results shown were solely achievable through their program or within the specified 28-day period using their app alone. It did not feature any before and after transformations. The 28-day Calisthenic Challenge was structured as a starting point for new users to integrate regular physical activity into their lives, which emphasised the start of a fitness journey, rather than specific outcomes. It was not intended to be a standalone, comprehensive fitness solution, but rather an entry-level program to motivate users to adopt a long-term approach to fitness. Additionally, users had access to a wide range of other fitness programmes including running, yoga, boot camp and other types of workouts. The programme also included access to diet plans. BetterMe said they used the “actor portrayal” disclaimer to communicate that the individuals depicted in their ads were professional actors. They said it was prominently displayed at the start of the ad with the font and size necessary to ensure it was seen by viewers before any claims were made. By using the disclaimer, they aimed to set realistic expectations and maintain transparency about the illustrative purpose of the portrayal. BetterMe provided examples of ads for fitness products by other companies which they said contained the same disclaimer. The decision to use a professional actor in the ad was driven by several factors. Many of their users were concerned about their privacy and personal exposure, and so it was very challenging to find real users who were willing to share their experiences in a public and highly visible ad. Although the current ad featured an actor, their ads were grounded in actual user experiences, and they were actively working towards involving real participants and incorporating user testimonials and success stories in upcoming campaigns. They maintained a collection of real user stories and visual before-and-after feedback that featured on their marketing channels and substantiated the claims in the ads. BetterMe said the ad was reviewed by their legal and compliance teams to ensure it met all relevant regulatory standards. However, in response to the complaint, they would extend the length of time the “actor portrayal” disclaimer appeared in their ads and would amend the size and style of the font to ensure it was seen by viewers before any claims were made. They would also include additional disclaimers that “individual results may vary” and dietary changes were necessary to achieve results in any similar future ads. They believed these changes would help set clearer expectations and assure viewers that results differed from person to person and would depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, individual effort, body type and adherence to the programme.","The ad featured a muscular man posing in the mirror and the claims, “I look like this and I didn’t even go to the gym” and “About 28 days ago I started BetterMe’s 28-day Calisthenic Challenge. I just finished up and I can say it is one of the greatest workout plans on the entire market.” The ASA considered viewers would understand that the man featured in the ad had recently completed BetterMe’s 28-day Calisthenic Challenge and had achieved a significant increase in the level of his muscularity as a result of completing the programme. We also considered, that in this context, viewers would associate going to the gym with using equipment likely to increase build and muscle tone and therefore the ad implied that a similar physique could be achieved in 28 days without going to the gym. We understood that calisthenics was a form of exercise that strengthened muscles by using an individual’s body weight as resistance and required little or no equipment. We considered that achieving a physique similar to the man who was featured in the ad would require a combination of exercises along with dietary changes over a period of time longer than 28 days. The ad did not include any ‘before’ images or information about the man’s level of fitness prior to starting BetterMe’s programme. However, the overall impression of the ad was that he had achieved a significant change in his muscular build solely by completing the Calisthenic Challenge without any other exercises or dietary changes, and by not using equipment traditionally found in a gym. Because we had not seen evidence that that was the case, we considered the ad was misleading and exaggerated the physical effects achievable on the programme within 28 days. The qualification “actor portrayal” was on-screen at the start of the ad, but was written in small, white font against a light background at the bottom of the screen, beneath other large, bold on-screen text. It was also on-screen very briefly. We considered those factors meant it was likely to be missed by viewers. Notwithstanding that, even if viewers had seen it, we considered that the claims, “I started Better Me’s 28-day Calisthenic Challenge”, “I just finished up”, “I can say”, along with the scene of the man doing press-ups, gave the impression that he had personally completed the programme when that was not the case. We therefore considered that the qualification “actor portrayal” contradicted those claims. We noted that BetterMe said they would extend the length of time that “actor portrayal” appeared on screen and would amend the size and font of the text. They would also add further qualifications that “individual results may vary” and that dietary changes were necessary to achieve any results. However, we considered that would still be insufficient to counter the impression that the person featured in the ad had actually completed the programme and had achieved a significant increase in their muscular build in 28 days. Because the ad gave the impression that the man featured had completed Better Me’s 28-day Calisthenic Challenge when that was not the case, and we had not seen evidence that a significant increase in muscularity was achievable after 28 days using the programme, we concluded that the ad was misleading and exaggerated the capability of the programme. The ad breached the CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading Advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.9, 3.10 (Qualification) and 3.11 (Exaggeration).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told BetterMe Ltd to ensure that their future ads did not misleadingly represent or exaggerate the capabilities of their exercise programme. We also told them to ensure that qualifications did not contradict the claims they were intended to clarify.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/betterme-ltd-a24-1238625-betterme-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Fussy Ltd,,"Two ads for Fussy Ltd, a deodorant company: a. An Instagram post published by the @getfussy account, on 21 December 2023, featured an image of a deodorant product with green, red and black packaging called ‘Mynx’. A caption on the post stated “£733 million is wasted on unwanted gifts each year. So what do you think to a sustainable alternative to the UK’s top Christmas selling gift set? Disclaimer: Please note, this is not a real product nor is it based or associated with anything real. It’s like imagining a unicorn riding a rainbow made of jelly beans – delightful, but definitely not happening. #itsajoke #mynxlondon #smelllikeamynx #christmasgiftpack”. b. A LinkedIn post by Fussy’s CEO and founder Matt Kennedy, published on 24 December 2023, featured the same image in ad (a). A caption on the post stated “£733 million is wasted on unwanted gifts each year. So how about a refillable version of the UK’s […] most unwanted […] Christmas giftpack? #mynxlondon #smelllikeamynx #christmasgiftpack. All views my own”.",,"Fussy Ltd said the ads were intended to be editorial social media posts and they had not promoted a real product. They said the purpose of the ads was to ask their customers whether they should launch a new refillable deodorant product, called ‘Mynx’. They said they were unable to provide specific evidence which claimed £733m was wasted on unwanted Christmas gifts each year, but provided links to two articles which stated significant amounts of money were unnecessarily spent on presents at Christmas time. They said the fictional Mynx product in the ads was not intended to allude to Lynx products, but acknowledged consumers may have interpreted it in that manner. They said they would remove the posts.","Upheld The CAP Code stated marketing communications that included a comparison with an identifiable competitor must objectively compare one or more material, relevant, verifiable and representative feature of those products. It also stated that marketing communications must not discredit or denigrate another product or marketer. The rule applied irrespective of whether or not a claim was true, if it appeared in a comparative advertisement and was expressed in terms which were insulting, derogatory or demeaning. Ads which included comparisons with competitors which went beyond a robust and objective comparison of their products or services risked breaching that rule. The ASA acknowledged that the image featured in both ads (a) and (b) was of a fictitious deodorant product given the name ‘Mynx’. We considered that the purpose of the fictional product was to promote Fussy, particularly in relation to the implied claim that they were a sustainable deodorant brand. Therefore, although the Mynx product was not real, ad (a), which was posted on Fussy’s official Instagram account, and ad (b), which was posted on LinkedIn by the company’s CEO, promoted the Fussy brand and fell within the remit of the CAP Code. We considered consumers would immediately recognise that the font, the colour scheme and the design of the Mynx branding was almost identical to the branding for Lynx deodorant products. We also considered consumers would understand that the fictional name Mynx was very similar to Lynx and was therefore an indirect reference to it. We considered that because the fictional product was readily recognisable as being a reference to Lynx, both posts included a comparison with an identifiable competitor.Ad (a) featured text which stated “£733 million is wasted on unwanted gifts each year. So what do you think to a sustainable alternative to the UK’s top Christmas selling gift set?”. Ad (b) featured text which stated “a sustainable alternative to the UK’s top Christmas selling gift set”, and that the Mynx product was “a refillable version of the UK’s most sold, most unwanted and most unsustainable Christmas giftpack”. We considered the terms “unwanted gifts” and “most unwanted” in that context to be pejorative comments which suggested Lynx products were of lower value and less desirable in comparison to its competitor products including Fussy. We also considered the word Mynx, in reference to Lynx, was a derogatory term which consumers would understand referred to a flirtatious person who enjoyed creating trouble for others. We therefore considered that those comments, which gave the impression that Lynx deodorant products were of little value, went beyond a robust and objective comparison between Lynx and Fussy deodorants. For those reasons, we considered ads (a) and (b) discredited and denigrated the Lynx brand and therefore breached the Code.The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.35 (Comparisons with Identifiable Competitors) and 3.42 (Imitation and Denigration).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Fussy Ltd to ensure their future ads did not discredit or denigrate the Lynx brand or their other competitors’ products.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/fussy-ltd-a24-1231334-fussy-ltd.html

The page featured a photograph of a man with the caption “Dr. Paul O’Connell - GP & Rehabilitation Engineer,” a 20-minute video in which Dr O’Connell discussed the Activ8 Joint Complete supplement and a “NEXT STEP” tab. The tab went to a survey on the same website and then a purchase page for “Activ8 Joint Complete”. Text stated, “Relieves soreness, stiffness, and discomfort – Prevents inflammation, damaged cartilage, and bone decay – Facilitates joint repair & recovery – Improves movement and flexibility”.","The ASA received two complaints. One complainant challenged whether: 1. the claims that Activ8 Joint Complete could treat or cure human disease were in breach of the Code; and 2. the specific health claims in the ads, which required authorisation on the Great Britain Register of nutrition and health claims, breached the Code. 3. A second complainant challenged whether the claim that Dr Paul O’Connell was “… the NHS’s leading joint expert …” was misleading and could be substantiated.","1., 2. & 3. Nutritional Sciences Ltd did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries during the investigation.","The ASA was concerned by Nutritional Sciences Ltd’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future.1. UpheldClaims which stated or implied that a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease were prohibited under the CAP Code. In the context that ad (a) was addressed to ""Seniors"", we considered consumers were likely to understand the claim “'Repair' Joints With This Tip” as a reference to treating or curing the degeneration of cartilage associated with ageing, as well as treating or curing conditions such as arthritis. Having clicked through from ad (a), and in the context of text in ad (b) which referenced an ""Arthritis Expert"", we considered that the claims: “… simply take three capsules with your main meal and the powerful active ingredients will immediately get to work restoring your joints” and “... if you don’t notice fewer daily aches and pains, reduced stiffness, increased flexibility and freer movement, better recovery after exercise and all-round healthier, younger-feeling body”, made in the video would also likely be understood to be references to treating or curing arthritis and other degenerative joint conditions. Additionally the claim ""this 'self-healing' mechanism can reverse YEARS of arthritis and joint damage"" would also be understood in the same way.Having clicked through again to the website purchase page, we considered consumers would also understand the claims, “Relieves soreness, stiffness, and discomfort – Prevents inflammation, damaged cartilage, and bone decay – Facilitates joint repair & recovery – Improves movement and flexibility” on that page to be references to treating or curing arthritis and other degenerative joint conditions, as well as joint pain and inflammation. While ad (a) did not attribute the claims to a specific product or service, we considered that, because it linked through to the website where the Activ8 Joint Complete food supplement was sold, it was an ad for that supplement. We considered both ads therefore included stated or implied claims that Activ8 Joint Complete could treat or cure arthritis and other degenerative joint conditions, the degeneration of cartilage associated with ageing and symptoms such as joint pain and inflammation. Because those were claims that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure human disease, we concluded that they breached the Code. On that point ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the applicable register, which in this case was the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB NHC Register), were permitted in marketing communications for foods. The CAP Code defined health claims as those which stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient and health.As discussed in Point 1, we considered that the ads included a range of claims that in the context in which they were presented, stated or implied that the supplement could help to treat or cure a range of joint conditions. The ads also included claims which could be understood as more limited claims that the supplement could support physiological functions that were beneficial to health. For example, we considered that the claims: “… greater flexibility, recovery and range of motion” and “supports healthy cartilage”, made in the video implied a relationship between the Activ8 Joint Complete supplement and the health of joints and cartilage, and in some contexts would be specific health claims for the purposes of the Code. Nutritional Sciences therefore needed to show that the claims were authorised on the GB NHC Register and that they met the conditions of use associated with the claims. Because Nutritional Sciences had not done that, we concluded that the claims breached the Code.On that point ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). We considered consumers would interpret “Dr Paul O’Connell, the NHS’s leading joint expert” to mean Paul O’Connell was considered by the NHS to be their leading authority in conditions affecting the joints. As such, Nutritional Sciences would be expected to hold evidence to support that. However, Nutritional Sciences had supplied no evidence to support the claim. But even if Nutritional Sciences had been able to supply evidence that Dr Paul O’Connell was the NHS’ leading authority in conditions affecting the joints, the CAP Code stated that health claims that referred to the recommendation of an individual health professional were not acceptable in marketing communications for food supplements. Because the ads attributed a range of health claims, and claims that the supplement could treat or cure human disease, to a ""Doctor"" or ""Dr Paul O'Connell"" specifically, or featured him directly making such claims, we considered they also breached the Code on that basis. Because we had not seen evidence that showed Dr Paul O’Connell was considered by the NHS to be their leading authority in conditions affecting the joints, and because the ads included health claims that referred to a recommendation by an individual health professional, we concluded that they breached the Code in both those regards. On that point the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 15.6.3 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of. We told Nutritional Sciences Ltd not to make claims which stated or implied that a food or drink product, or a food supplement, could prevent, treat or cure human disease or to make health claims which referred to the recommendation of an individual health professional in their marketing communications for food supplements. They must also ensure that any specific health claims made in relation to foods and food supplements were authorised on the GB NHC Register. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/nutritional-sciences-ltd-g24-1241706-nutritional-sciences-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Online Classifieds AG t/a PURE,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Two posters for the PURE Dating App, seen in March 2024: a. The poster depicted four images of cartoon style heads, next to text that stated, “IT’S A GOOD DAY TO GET SOME HEAD” and “ON PURE DATING APP” followed by a QR code. b. The poster depicted a cartoon head of a princess, next to text that stated, “DON’T PLAY WITH MY EMOTION, PLAY WITH MY” followed by a cartoon image of a clamshell. Further text stated “ON PURE DATING APP” followed by a QR code.","The complainants, who understood the ads contained implied sexual references and were displayed near two schools, challenged whether they were: 1. offensive; and 2. inappropriate for display in an untargeted medium where they could be seen by children.","1. Online Classifieds AG t/a PURE dating believed the complainants’ interpretation of the ads complaints was exaggerated and unfounded. The ads used playful, yet ambiguous language and imagery, including cartoon-style graphics and indirect references, which allowed consumers to interpret them according to their own perceptions and perspectives. They said the text was crafted with humour and innuendo in mind and aimed to engage consumers’ imaginations in a playful manner, while ensuring no explicit content or direct references were used. 2. PURE dating explained that the locations had been chosen by the billboard owners, BUILDHOLLYWOOD Ltd. They said the campaign was intended for display in designated spaces where the audience would expect to encounter this sort of content. The ads were not meant for general public areas frequented by children. They were not informed of the specific location of the posters or made aware of their proximity to schools and had they been aware, those locations would not have been approved. Notwithstanding that, they said the humorous language in the ads had been deliberately crafted to be misunderstood by children, ensuring that only the intended adult audience would grasp the underlying references. BUILDHOLLYWOOD Ltd said that due to the amusing tone of the design, they had believed the ads were acceptable for general display. However, they now understood that the ads had been placed close to schools which might not have been acceptable. They said they were reviewing their internal systems to ensure similar ads were placed appropriately in future, such as ensuring some posters were not placed close to schools. They had not received any complaints about the ads.","1. & 2. UpheldAd (a) contained an image of four cartoon-style heads alongside text stating, “It’s a good day to get some head on Pure Dating app”. The ASA considered that, in that context, people would be likely to interpret “GET SOME HEAD” as slang for oral sex and would understand that the ad was suggesting oral sex could be obtained by accessing the Pure dating app. We considered such a reference was overtly sexual.Ad (b) contained an image of the head of a cartoon princess next to text stating, “DON’T PLAY WITH MY EMOTION, PLAY WITH MY” followed by a cartoon image of a clamshell. We understood that “clam” was commonly used as slang for female genitalia. We therefore considered that, in the context of an ad for a dating app, consumers were likely to understand the text to be sexual innuendo alluding to playing with female genitalia and that the ad was suggesting it could be sourced on the Pure Dating app. We recognised that there would be some people who were not familiar with the slang meaning of “clam” or had not recognised the cartoon to be a clamshell. However, in the context of an ad for a dating app, we considered they would nonetheless assume the cartoon picture was a reference to a body part and was sexual in nature. We therefore considered the reference was overtly sexual.The ads were displayed in outdoor poster sites in London in an untargeted medium and where the ads were likely to be seen by large numbers of people, including under 18s. We understood that ad (a) was less than 100 metres from the nearest school. We considered that while younger children were likely to be unaware of what the wording and images meant, older children were likely to have greater awareness of the sexual references in the ads. We considered that, because the references in the ads were overtly sexual and were displayed in an untargeted medium where they had the potential to be seen by a large number of people, including children, they were likely to cause widespread offence and were irresponsible. We concluded that the ads therefore breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising) and 4.1 (Harm and offence).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Online Classifieds AG t/a Pure dating to ensure that future advertising in outdoor media did not contain overtly sexual themes and to avoid causing widespread offence.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/online-classifieds-ag-g24-1239261-online-classifieds-ag.html
ASA Ruling on Portable Multimedia Ltd,,"A page on the Next Base website www.nextbase.co.uk, for three dash cam models, seen on 31 January 2024, stated under the headline “Enhanced Night Vision” that the models were “capable of picking up the finer details such as number plates and road signs even in extreme low-light conditions”. Further text stated that the 422GW and 522GW models were able to “capture and process superior image quality” and provide “a clear view of your surroundings, even at night”. An image showed a dash cam view of a busy motorway at night, with clear and readable number plates on two of the cars ahead. Underneath, a heading “Dash Cams with Enhanced Night Vision” was followed by images of the 522GW, 422GW and 322GW models.",The complainant challenged whether the ad misleadingly exaggerated the ability of the products to capture detail in low light conditions.,"Portable Multimedia Ltd t/a Next Base said that there were times when variables such as speed, rain, light and window cleanliness could make a number plate less visible, and they did not claim to always capture these details. However, their cameras could capture finer details such as number plates and road signs in such conditions. They said they had inserted number plates with fake numbers into the ad’s image so that the vehicles could not be identified. They said that compared to other available alternatives on the market and their own lower-end models, they felt confident about the claim that the 422GW and 522GW models could “capture and process superior image quality” even in extreme low light conditions. In the context of the website as a whole, it was clear that the claim that those models offered a clear view even at night was in comparison to their own lower-end models. To illustrate the image quality, they provided a selection of footage from their 622GW model and a short clip of footage from their 522GW model.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so and must not mislead consumers by exaggerating the capability or performance of a product. Under the headline “Enhanced Night Vision”, the ad showed a crisp and high resolution image of several cars travelling on a wet motorway at night time, with two cars displaying clear and readable number plates. The ASA considered that consumers would understand the image to be a screengrab taken directly from real footage sourced from one of the three Next Base models referenced in the ad. It showed vehicles travelling along a motorway, and we therefore considered consumers would expect that the details shown could be captured by the dash cams even at speeds of around 70 miles per hour. Because the ad did not identify which model the image had been taken with, consumers would interpret the image as being representative of the enhanced night vision capability they could expect from all three advertised dash cam models. We further considered the accompanying claims that the 422GW and 522GW models were able to “capture and process superior image quality” and provide “a clear view of your surroundings, even at night” would be understood as reinforcing the impression created by the image. However, the image in the ad was not taken from Next Base dash cam footage. Rather, it was a stock photo in which the number plates were already blurred out, and to which Next Base had added readable number plates to the two closest cars. We considered the use of that image was therefore misleading, because it was not taken from footage from any of the advertised dash cams. Notwithstanding that, we reviewed the footage provided by Next Base to determine whether the quality of detail in the ad was representative of footage captured by the advertised dash cams. Next Base provided footage for the 622GW – a newer model that did not feature in the ad and so was not relevant to our investigation – and one 30-second clip for the 522GW model. That clip showed footage of driving in similar conditions shown in the ad’s image. Some finer details ‒ for example, the wording on some of the signs ‒ were visible when the vehicle was travelling at slow speeds. However, when the vehicle was travelling at speeds around 30 miles per hour finer details, particularly the number plates, were not as clear as shown in the ad’s image, including when the video was paused. We considered that one clip was not sufficient evidence to substantiate that any of the three advertised models were capable of capturing the level of detailed night vision presented in the ad. We concluded the ad exaggerated the capability of the advertised products and was therefore misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.11 (Exaggeration).",The ad must not appear again in the forms complained of. We told Portable Multimedia Ltd t/a Next Base to ensure that images in their ads did not misleadingly represent or exaggerate the performance of their products.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/portable-multimedia-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on iVape London Ltd,,"An email for iVape, a vaping retailer, dated the 26 January 2024, included text in the subject line, “Unwrap Your Savings! Get an exclusive offer on all Vape Kits”. The body of the email said, “Act fast, this special deal is valid for ONLY 24 Hours”. It then showed images and prices for six vaping kits.","The complainant, who understood that the promotion of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components were not permitted in electronic media, challenged that the ad breached the Code.",iVape London Ltd t/a iVape did not respond to the ASA enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by iVape London Ltd’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was in breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. Upheld The CAP Code reflected a legislative ban contained in the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 (TRPR) on the advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components in certain media, including online and some other forms of electronic media. Only factual claims about unlicensed nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components were permitted on marketer’s own websites, and, in certain circumstances, in other non-paid-for space online under the marketer’s control. Claims, therefore, promotional in nature were prohibited. The ad, an email, which was sent to a member of the public, highlighted six vape kits that the ASA understood all could be used with nicotine containing e-liquids. In addition, two images in the email, featured the specific vape kits alongside packaging with warnings that the products contained nicotine. Therefore, we considered that the vape kits could be used with nicotine-containing e-liquids, and as such the ad directly promoted nicotine-containing e-cigarettes.  We further noted that the subject line of the email stated, “Unwrap Your Savings! Get an exclusive offer on all Vape Kits” and the body of the email said, “Act fast, this special deal is valid for ONLY 24 Hours”. Therefore, the email went further than simple factual claims and constituted descriptive, promotional language that was not permitted under the Code. Because we considered that the ad, which contained claims that were promotional in nature, directly promoted unlicensed nicotine-containing e-cigarettes to consumers in unpermitted electronic media, we concluded the ad breached the CAP Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 22 .12 (Electronic cigarettes).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told iVape London Ltd that marketing communications that promoted nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components to consumers, which were not licensed as medicines, should not be made in their emails.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/ivape-london-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Future Farm Plant-Based Food UK Ltd t/a Future Farm,,"The product packaging for a Future Farm Future Burger, seen on 9 February 2024, featured a promotion. Text on the front of the packaging stated, “WIN £1000 BUY ME AND SCAN TO ENTER *T&C’S APPLY”. A QR code was in the centre of the text.",The complainant challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it omitted the significant conditions of the promotion,Future Farm Plant-Based Food UK Ltd t/a Future Farm did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"Upheld The ASA was concerned by Future Farm’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code stated that promotions must communicate all applicable significant conditions where their omission was likely to mislead. Marketing communications that include a promotion and are significantly limited by time or space must include as much information about significant conditions as practicable and must direct consumers clearly to an easily accessible alternative source where all the significant conditions of the promotion are prominently stated. Participants should be able to retain those conditions or easily access them throughout the promotion. We understood that there were no terms and conditions on the product packaging. In addition, when the QR code, also featured on the packaging, was scanned the consumer was taken to the Future Farm website, where the promotion’s significant terms and conditions were also not stated. We understood that the terms and conditions of the promotion had been listed on a Future Farm Instagram post in December 2023. The post stated the prize was a “£1,000 shopping spree” made up of vouchers. In addition, the closing date for the promotion was 23:59 on 31 January 2024 and the winner would be drawn two weeks after that date and contacted by Future Farm directly, but not on social media. None of those details were on the packaging or landing page for the QR code, however. We also understood the promotional pack was purchased by the complainant on 9 February 2024 and an entry was able to be submitted on 25 February 2024, after the closing date stated on Instagram. We did not know whether consumers making such entries had been excluded from the prize draw, having already made the decision to purchase a pack that did not include a closing date, or whether the closing date had been changed. However, closing dates must not be changed unless circumstances beyond the control of the promoter made it unavoidable and there would be no disadvantage to those who had already entered. We therefore considered the administration of the promotion was likely to breach the Code for those reasons. In addition, we considered that the closing date, the nature of the prize (whether it was in cash or vouchers), how and when winners would be notified and how many prizes there were, were significant conditions, and because they had been omitted from the packaging, and not provided via an easily accessible alternative source, that the promotion again breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.7 (Unreasonable delay), 8.1 (Promotional marketing), 8.2, 8.17, 8.17.1, 8.17.4, 8.17.4.a, 8.17.4.e, 8.17.6, 8.18 (Significant conditions for promotions), 8.28, 8.28.4 (Prize promotions).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on AHK Designs Ltd t/a Victoriaplum.com,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website, Instagram account, and X account for Victoria Plum, an online bathroom retailer, seen in December 2023: a. The homepage of the website www.victoriaplum.com, included text which stated “Since we were founded in 2001, we’ve gone on to become the UK’s online bathroom specialists, serving well over 2 million customers […] For over 2 decades, we’ve remained at the forefront of the UK bathroom industry […] it’s no wonder our customers rate us ‘Excellent’”. Under another section titled “What do our customers think?” text stated “With over 140,000 reviews, our customers on independent review site Trustpilot rate us ‘Excellent’ – a fact we’re very proud of”. The “About us” page of the website included text that stated “At Victoria Plum, we’re proud to have helped over 2 million customers across the UK […] Founded in 2001, we’ve been at the forefront of online bathroom buying for over 22 years”. Text further down the page, which stated ""Update: Business changes 2023"", contained a link to another page of the website that outlined changes to the ownership and administration of Victoria Plum. b. The Instagram account (@victoriaplumuk) bio section included text which stated “At Victoria Plum, we're proud to have helped 2M+ customers achieve their dream bathroom”. c. The X account (@VictoriaPlumUK) bio section included text which stated “Rated ‘Excellent’ on Trustpilot with 2M+ customers served”.","Victorian Plumbing Ltd, who understood that AHK Designs Ltd had acquired the right to use the Victoria Plum brand in September 2023, challenged whether the following claims were misleading and could be substantiated: 1. “Since we were founded in 2001”, “For over 2 decades, we’ve remained at the forefront of the UK bathroom industry”, “Founded in 2001” and “we’ve been at the forefront of online bathroom buying for over 22 years” seen in ad (a); 2. “With over 140,000 reviews, our customers on independent review site Trustpilot rate us ‘Excellent’” and “Rated ‘Excellent’ on Trustpilot” seen in ads (a) and (c); and 3. “serving well over 2 million customers”, “we're proud to have helped 2M+ customers”, and “2M+ customers served” seen in ads (a), (b) and (c).","1., 2. & 3. AHK Designs Ltd t/a Victoria Plum said they had entered into an agreement to purchase Victoria Plum Ltd (VPL) on 29 September 2023, via a pre-pack purchase of VPL's business and assets from administrators. They explained that a pre-pack purchase meant that the sale was negotiated and agreed upon by the parties before the insolvent business goes into administration. As such, they said they had continued to trade, uninterrupted, under the Victoria Plum brand since then. AHK believed that the pre-pack purchase mechanism was a standard approach to similar insolvency situations. Victoria Plum said they had bought VPL as a going concern, and that the purchase had included equipment, stock, vehicles, records, work in progress and intellectual property rights, including the goodwill in the business. However, they clarified that as part of the pre-pack purchase, they did not need to take on VPL’s liabilities unless they elected to do so under the sale contract or of their own volition afterwards. They said the business was being conducted from the same premises, with mostly the same employees and that they had elected to take on various liabilities and most supplier contracts, to ensure the supply of services. Victoria Plum said they had honoured certain customer contracts entered into prior to their purchase of VPL, on a case-by-case basis, despite not having a legal obligation to do so while administrators continued to deal with the administration of VPL. Because Victoria Plum believed that the VPL brand they had purchased was effectively the same company, merely with different owners, and because they had continued to trade uninterrupted, they believed they had the right to make the claims identified in the complaint. Victoria Plum believed the points made in response to issue 1 and the wider longevity claims regarding the brand also applied to their promotion of the Trustpilot TrustScore, and their “customers served” claims. Victoria Plum said that, as of 11 January 2024, their TrustScore was 4.4 stars, equating to an “Excellent"" rating. They said the score included contemporaneous reviews, submitted since their purchase of the business, and a range of reviews, from five- to one-star ratings, and was based on multiple factors such as the age and total number of reviews, with newer reviews being given more weight, and was not a simple average of the submitted reviews. Because Victoria Plum believed it was effectively still the same business, they also thought it was not misleading to refer to the total overall number of customers served during the overall lifetime of the business.","1., 2. & 3. Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claims “Since we were founded in 2001”, “For over 2 decades, we’ve remained at the forefront of the UK bathroom industry”, “Founded in 2001” and “we’ve been at the forefront of online bathroom buying for over 22 years” seen in ad (a) to mean that the VPL brand had, since being founded in 2001, enjoyed over 22 years of uninterrupted trading from then up until the present day. We considered that the claims would give consumers confidence in dealing with the company that payments would be secure, and orders fulfilled. Furthermore, we considered that consumers would understand the claims “With over 140,000 reviews, our customers on independent review site Trustpilot rate us ‘Excellent’” seen in ad (a) to mean that Victoria Plum had a proven track record of receiving “excellent” ratings from customers who used Trustpilot. We also considered that consumers would understand the Trustpilot claims in ad (a) within the context of the longevity claims, and would therefore assume that their Trustpilot score had been built up throughout the business’s years of trading, which further helped create an impression of longevity and stability from the brand. Similarly, we considered that consumers would understand the claims “serving well over 2 million customers” and “we're proud to have helped over 2 million customers across the UK”, seen in ad (a), to mean that VPL was an ongoing, established business with a strong, uninterrupted history of serving over 2 million customers. Ad (b) stated that Victoria Plum had served over “2M+ customers”, and ad (c) contained the claim “Rated ‘Excellent’ on Trustpilot with 2M+ customers served”. We considered consumers would interpret those ads similarly to ad (a); namely, that the Victoria Plum brand was an ongoing well-established business, and that they were rated as “Excellent” on Trustpilot based on a number of reviews since they had been founded. CAP guidance stated that marketers claiming their business has been established for a specific number of years, or implying that their business had been established for a long time, should hold documentary evidence to substantiate such claims. It noted that a consumer’s transactional decision may be affected by claims that a company was well-established or had a long trading history. It also noted that a company that had bought another existing or liquidated company may want to adopt the brand heritage of the purchased company, by continuing to advertise using the business name as a trading style, and referring to its trading history. That approach was only likely to be acceptable provided that the purchasing business could demonstrate that it had assumed the liabilities of the purchased company, for example by paying its debts and honouring its guarantees. We understood that VPL had entered into administration on 29 September 2023, and that AHK Designs had entered into an agreement to purchase VPL via a pre-pack purchase of its business and assets from administrators on the same day. We acknowledged Victoria Plum’s claim that they had continued to trade, uninterrupted, under the Victoria Plum brand name since then, and their belief that they had bought the business as a ‘going concern’. We understood the term ‘going concern’ indicated that an organisation would have sufficient funds to pay its obligations (trade creditors, payroll, etc.) as required over at least the following 12 months, and would not appear to be at risk of closing due to insolvency. We assessed the Joint Administrators’ Statement of Proposals regarding VPL’s administration, which was provided by Victoria Plum. The Statement of Proposals confirmed that, despite an extensive marketing process, no viable offers had been received to purchase VPL as a ‘going concern’, and pay all of its obligations over at least the following 12 months. Rather than purchasing VPL as a ‘going concern’, we understood that AHK Designs purchased a pre-pack sale of VPL’s business and certain assets, which included the intellectual property rights and the “goodwill in the business” – a business’s value built up over time through its good name and reputation. We also noted that aspects of the business, such as staff and premises, had remained the same since the purchase. AHK Designs said they had taken on various liabilities, including supplier contracts, and certain customer contracts, despite not having a legal obligation to do so while administrators continued to deal with the administration of VPL. However, we were not provided with any supporting evidence which showed that customer contracts entered into prior to VPL entering administration had been honoured. We further noted that the “Business changes” page of the Victoria Plum website stated that the company was not able to fulfil any orders which had been placed prior to its entering into administration, and that they were unable to accept any returns or provide any refunds on goods or orders, including for consumers who had yet to receive their goods. We also noted that VPL was itself still in administration, while the Victoria Plum brand name was being continued by AHK Designs, following their pre-pack purchase. We considered the fact that the VPL was not purchased as a ‘going concern’ and, therefore, previous customer orders were not fulfilled, and that VPL was still in administration, would have an impact on a consumer’s view of the business and the claims made in the ads regarding the longevity of the VPL brand, its Trustpilot reviews, and the overall total number of customers served. Furthermore, we considered that the purchase of a business which had been unable to be sold as a ‘going concern’ did not meet the requirements set out in CAP guidance for companies who had bought another existing or liquidated company, and wanted to adopt its brand heritage and refer to its trading history, especially when other aspects of the business had not been taken on by the purchasing company. In relation to the Trustpilot claims seen in ads (a) and (c), we acknowledged AHK Design’s belief that, because the Victoria Plum Trustpilot score included contemporaneous reviews, and that the Trustpilot system gave greater weight to newer such reviews, it was not simply an average of all submitted reviews and was therefore reflective of customer reviews submitted since their purchase of the business. We noted, however, that filtering Victoria Plum’s Trustpilot score to show only reviews from the last 12 months ? which included five months during which time the brand was not owned by AHK Designs ? showed that just over 10,000 reviews, out of a total of 146,038, had been submitted since April 2023. We therefore considered that the vast majority of the Trustpilot reviews for the Victoria Plum brand related to the original iteration of the business. They had, therefore, been submitted prior to their entering administration and the subsequent purchase by AHK Designs. Because consumers would expect the Trustpilot score to reflect the overall score of a stable business which had run without interruption since its inception, and because this was not the case, we further considered that the claims regarding the overall Trustpilot score were misleading. Because we considered that the claims regarding Victoria Plum’s longevity would have an impact on consumer confidence and expectation, and because VPL had actually gone into administration and previous consumer orders had not been fulfilled, we considered that the impression created by the claims, of an ongoing business that had served over 2 million customers and attained an “Excellent” Trustpilot score over the course of an uninterrupted trading history, were misleading.We therefore concluded that the claims regarding the longevity of the business, the number of customers served and the Trustpilot score seen in ads had not been substantiated, and were misleading. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading Advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told AHK Designs Ltd t/a Victoria Plum to ensure that any claims they made regarding the longevity of the Victoria Plum brand, the customer reviews of the brand, and the total number of customers served by the brand in its current form were not misleading and were capable of substantiation.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/ahk-designs-ltd-a23-1217433-ahk-designs-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Avensure Ltd t/a Employment Law Advice Bureau,,"A direct mailing to a business, received on 15 March 2024, sent in an envelope with the text “PRIVATE” at the top left and “IMPORTANT INFORMATION” at the bottom right. It featured a ‘scales of justice’ logo at the bottom left. The back of the envelope included a return address for Avensure Ltd. The enclosed letter featured a crest at the top of the letter with the text “HR24 ADVISORY BUREAU STOCKPORT & MANCHESTER”, stated “Confidential” above the name and address of the recipient, and “Private & Confidential” with a reference number to the right-hand side. Large, bold text then stated “Government Announcement”, under which text stated “You are invited to attend an important training update for leading business owners in Stockport and Manchester. The government has announced an unprecedented number of new employment law changes for 2024 […]. It is essential that you know what amendments are coming (and when) so you can prepare and protect your business. To ensure you are fulfilling your legal obligations, we highly recommend you join us for the ‘2024 Employer Action Plan’ workshop […]”. Bullet points listed topics that would be covered, followed by the text “Cost: Due to the government announcement, there will be no charge on this occasion”, details of the event, and contact information for securing a place at the event. Small text at the bottom of the page stated “The HR24 Advisory Bureau is a trading name of Avensure Ltd”, followed by details of its Company House and VAT registrations and registered office address. A second page included a logo for the CPD Certification Service, client reviews, and “Key Employment Law Stats”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication and made clear its commercial intent.,"Avensure Ltd t/a The HR24 Advisory Bureau explained that the letter was an invitation to attend a free seminar/training update on employment law changes and other employment and HR matters. It did not promote any product or service which required payment from the recipient. They said the envelope and letter were marked “Private” and “Confidential” because the contents were intended for the addressee only. They believed the use of the ‘scales of justice’ logo on the envelope was not misleading because their business involved justice and there were solicitors and barristers working for the company. The logo was very generic and was used by many different businesses that provided different services. The envelope also confirmed Avensure’s details; recipients were therefore made aware of the sender’s details without needing to open the envelope. They said the ‘crest’ at the top of the letter was The HR24 Advisory Bureau’s logo and clearly stated that name. They believed recipients therefore would immediately be aware of who the letter was from. They additionally highlighted that the footer of the letter confirmed their company details, registered name, number and office address. They said the letter did not claim that The HR24 Advisory Bureau and/or Avensure were affiliated to any public or other body, or that the material had been authorised by such a body. The wording “Government Announcement” referred to the event providing education on the latest government updates on employment regulations and law. The opening paragraph was clear that the letter’s purpose was to invite recipients to attend a training update.","Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications were obviously identifiable as such. They must not materially mislead or be likely to do so, and must make clear their commercial intent.In order for direct mailings to be obviously identifiable as marketing communications, recipients should be able to tell from the envelope itself that it was a marketing communication. The ASA considered recipients might expect, from the generic ‘scales of justice’ logo and the text “PRIVATE” and “IMPORTANT INFORMATION” on the front of the envelope, that the information enclosed related to the law in some way. However, those elements did not make clear that it was a marketing communication. We further considered that including a return address on the back of the envelope was not sufficient to make clear that it contained a marketing communication. The ad therefore breached the Code.Notwithstanding that the envelope did not make clear that it was an ad, we also reviewed the letter. The body of the letter was prominently headed “Government Announcement”. We considered that implied the mailing was from a public body and contained an official announcement. We considered that impression was reinforced by the statements that the letter was “Private” and “Confidential”, which was uncommon phrasing in commercial communications, and its use of imperative language such as “It is essential that you know what amendments are coming […]” and “To ensure you are fulfilling your legal obligations, we highly recommend you join us […]”. We acknowledged that the crest-like logo at the top of the page included the name “HR24 ADVISORY BUREAU STOCKPORT & MANCHESTER”. However, we considered many recipients would not be aware that this was a trading name of the business Avensure Ltd. Because Avensure’s company information, including that ‘The HR24 Advisory Bureau’ was its trading name, was presented in small print at the bottom of the first page, recipients were unlikely to have seen it before reading the main body of the letter. Similarly, client reviews on the second page which were more in common with commercial communications would not have been seen before recipients formed an impression of the letter based on the main body content. We therefore considered it was not clear that the letter was sent by a commercial entity offering a service, but instead implied that it had been sent by a public body. We concluded that the ad was not identifiable as a marketing communication and did not make clear its commercial intent. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications), and 3.1 (Misleading advertising).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Avensure Ltd t/a The HR24 Advisory Bureau to ensure its marketing communications were obviously identifiable and made clear their commercial intent, including by ensuring that envelopes made clear they contained a marketing communication.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/avensure-ltd-a24-1238628-avensure-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Kingsland Drinks Ltd t/a Kingsland Wines & Spirits,,"A label wound around the neck of bottles of Campaneo Wines, seen on 24 November 2023, advertised a promotion to win one of five pizza ovens. Large text on both ends of the label stated “WIN 1 of 5 OONI PIZZA OVENS”. Text in between stated “ENTER TO WIN SO YOU CAN CREATE IRRESISTIBLE PIZZAS AT HOME TO ENJOY WITH A GLASS OF CAMPANEO WINE. ENTER ON OUR WEBSITE - FOLLOW THE LINK OR QR CODE. CAMPANEOWINES.CO.UK/COMPETITION – SEE OUR FULL T&Cs ON OUR WEBSITE”. An additional flap featured a QR code.","The complainant, who believed the ad omitted significant conditions and information about how to participate, challenged whether the promotion breached the Code.","Kingsland Drinks Ltd (Kingsland) said there was limited space on the neck labels but that they stated where purchasers could enter the competition and where the full terms and conditions could be found. They believed the QR code and website address were sufficiently clearly shown on the label and made it easy to navigate to a web page about the promotion, and a further page where the terms and conditions were set out. They said the terms and conditions stated that entrants needed to hold evidence of purchase, but that there were no other significant entry restrictions. Kingsland said the promotion did not have a specific closing date but believed that did not disadvantage consumers. They said the end date was subject to all promotional packs selling through. That was explained in the terms and conditions, and they believed it was in line with the CAP Code.Kingsland said they had produced one production run of the promotional bottles (5,334 cases) which they had initially estimated would take three to four months to sell through. They had subsequently revised their estimate to five to six months because of the slower speed at which the stock was selling. The promotional bottles were sold through one specific supermarket only (in-store and online) and Kingsland were able to track sales through data received from that supermarket. They would draw the winners 14 days after the date on which the final promotional bottle was sold. If the supermarket stopped selling the product before all the promotional bottles were sold, Kingsland would still draw the five winners from those who had already entered the draw. Kingsland said they would be willing to make changes to the terms and conditions to bring the ad into line with the Code.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that all marketing communications which referred to promotions must communicate all applicable significant conditions or information where the omission of such conditions or information was likely to mislead. Significant conditions or information may, depending on the circumstances, include information about how to participate and a closing date. The ASA understood that Kingsland would know through their tracking system that the final bottle had been sold and that the draw could then take place.The mechanics of the promotion meant that potential participants needed to enter within 14 days of the final bottle being purchased to ensure that their entry was included when the draw took place. However, potential participants had no way of knowing how many promotional bottles were still left to sell. With wine being a non-perishable product, bottles could be on shelves for months. All purchasers would therefore need to enter the promotion within 14 days of purchase to ensure they could participate. We therefore considered that information about the circumstances in which the draw would be undertaken was significant information about how to participate, which should have been communicated in the ad. That included that to have a chance of winning, purchasers must enter the promotion within 14 days of purchase, because the draw would take place 14 days after the last bottle of the 5,334 promotional cases had been sold, and that participants needed to be able to show proof of purchase. We further considered there was sufficient space on the label to have included such information. We considered that because the ad omitted significant conditions and information that were likely to influence a consumer’s decision or understanding about the promotion and the omission of that information was likely to mislead, the promotion therefore breached the Code. The promotion breached CAP Code (Edition 12) 8.17, 8.17.1, 8.17.4.a, and 8.18 (Promotional marketing).","The promotion must not be run again in the form complained of. We told Kingsland Drinks Ltd to ensure that their future ads for promotions included all significant conditions and information about the promotions, including how to participate, where their omission was likely to mislead.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/kingsland-drinks-ltd-a23-1223723-kingsland-drinks-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Pink Self Storage Ltd,,"A website for Pink Storage, www.pinkstorage.co.uk, was seen on 27 January 2024. A web page headed “YOUR QUOTE” included text that stated “Get 50% off your storage for up to 8 weeks” and included quotes for a 160 square foot storage unit. There was qualifying text further down the page that stated “The prices you see above are the prices you pay, No Hidden Fees”.","The complainant, who was informed that the weekly price of their storage unit had been increased, challenged whether the claim “The prices you see above are the prices you pay, No Hidden Fees” was misleading.","Pink Self Storage Ltd t/a Pink Storage said that they quoted for one week and that was the price consumers paid for the one week. As per their terms and conditions they held the right to increase prices. They could not hold their rates indefinitely and checked their prices against competitors often, to ensure they were competitive. They said that, although the claim was factually correct, they had removed the claim.","Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “The prices you see above are the prices you pay, No Hidden Fees” to mean that the price quoted would be the price that they would pay for the duration of the time they were using the storage unit, and that there would be nothing additional to pay. We understood that Pink Storage had an introductory offer whereby consumers would save 50% on the first 8 weeks, after which point, the weekly price would revert to the full price referenced in the quote. The complainant had been quoted a weekly price of £10 for the first eight weeks which would then increase to £20 a week. Whilst they had paid the reduced price as quoted during the 8-week introductory period and the full, quoted price for 6 weeks thereafter, they were then informed that the weekly price would be increased to £40, and then further to £60. Furthermore, when they were informed of the price increases, the price stated on the website for the same storage unit at the same location was £30 per week. Pink Storage’s terms and conditions stated that they may alter their fees at any time by giving the customer written notice and that the new fees would take effect on the next billing cycle. However, notwithstanding that there was nothing in the ad itself explaining that they may alter their fees at any time. We considered that this information was insufficient to counter the impression given by the claim.Therefore, because the price consumers paid could be increased from what they were quoted, we concluded that the claim “The prices you see above are the prices you pay, No Hidden Fees” was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9, 3.10 (Qualification), 3.17 (Prices).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Pink Self Storage Ltd t/a Pink Storage not to claim that their quoted prices were the prices that consumers would pay and that there were no hidden fees if consumers had to pay more than they were quoted.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/pink-self-storage-ltd-a24-1231002-pink-self-storage-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on We Are TALA Ltd,,"Two Instagram reels and four TikTok posts on Grace Beverly’s accounts, @gracebeverley: a. An Instagram reel, jointly posted on 24 October 2023 by Grace Beverley and TALA, featured a caption which stated “with a waitlist as long as the list of things this coat can do, she’s finally back after a year. This Thursday, 12pm on @wearetala. Ps. Watch till the end for a chance to win a puffer”. The reel featured a video of Grace Beverley describing the benefits and versatility of a puffer jacket. During the video she said “These puffers were made in factories we literally had to beg at the door to get into” and “She’s now launching in charcoal and vintage khaki, and she’s launching an online version too”. At the end of the video, she said “I’m going to give away three of the short line ones, one in each colour, just tell me how much you want it.” Text on the video stated “give me less than a minute to tell you why this is the best coat the world has ever seen”. b. An Instagram reel, jointly posted on 25 October 2023 by Grace Beverley and TALA, featured a caption which stated “oh you thought we were done”. The reel featured a video of Grace Beverley describing the benefits of a coat and the different scenarios it could be used for. Text superimposed on the video said “give me one minute to tell you why you need a Co-op pyjama coat”. c. A TikTok post, seen on 24 October 2023, featured a video of Grace Beverley wearing and interacting with the coat which featured in ad (a). Text superimposed on the video stated “4-in-1 puffer asmr for sleep meditation”. A caption on the post stated “part 2. The Co-op pyjama puffer”. d. A TikTok post, seen on 25 October 2023, featured the same video as seen in ad (b). A caption on the post stated “Part 28. Oh you thought we were done”. e. A TikTok post, seen on 25 October 2023, featured a video of Grace Beverley describing a bomber jacket. Within the video, she stated “I wanted to make a bomber that was made out of all the cold weather materials” and “I don’t know if I’ve ever been so proud of how one of our pieces has turned out”. A caption on the video stated Grace was replying to a user who asked her a question. That question was featured as an image imposed on the video and stated “How much is the reversible colour bomber jacket and can you do a video modelling that one too?”. Further text superimposed on the video stated “give me less than a minute to tell you why this reversible bomber is the most perfect winter bomber you can imagine”. f. A TikTok post, posted on 27 October 2023, featured a video of Grace Beverley trying on various items of clothing and jewellery. Within the video, she stated “It’s thrilling just being able to make clothes you wanted to buy, and then not really having to buy them even though you had to buy thousands of units”. Text on the video stated “GRWM. Day to night”. A caption on the post stated “Part 1. Cool girl”.",51 complainants challenged whether the posts were obviously identifiable as marketing communications.,"We Are TALA Ltd t/a TALA said Grace Beverley was widely synonymous with the business and its branding, which they believed was unusual within the fashion industry. They said it was uncommon for an influencer to be the founder and owner of such a successful and well-known business, but that alongside Ms Beverley, they were aware of the importance of ensuring ads were identifiable. However, they believed there was a deliberate and clear use of language in all the ads which indicated there was a commercial relationship between TALA and Ms Beverley, and more specifically, that TALA was her own business. They believed the majority of her followers would have known that, and given that context, the use of a disclaimer should not have been mandatory for all marketing communications promoting TALA on her personal social media pages. They believed such a disclaimer would itself have made the ads misleading, as it would have led consumers to think that rather than being the founder or owner of the TALA business, Ms Beverley was an arm’s length influencer who had no commercial interest in the business, and was merely promoting goods because she was being paid to do so. They said her TikTok bio clearly indicated she had a commercial relationship with TALA, and that ads (c), (d) and (e) featured on a TikTok video playlist Ms Beverley curated, titled “aggressive marketing”, which she had created specifically to ensure her posts were obviously identifiable as ads. They said her extensive use of the first-person plural in ads (d), (e) and (f) made that connection further obvious. They believed the cumulative effect of her bio, the playlist title and the language used would have made it clear to viewers that the posts were ads, and that very few users on social media interested in fashion or who followed Ms Beverley would have been unaware of her connection to TALA. They believed that requiring Ms Beverley to label posts on her personal social media channels promoting TALA, because a small number of people who followed her may have not known that she was the founder of the company, was unfair. Ms Beverley’s representatives said she was the founder and director of TALA, as stated on her Wikipedia page and in all of her social media account biographies. They believed she was synonymous with the brand, and that viewers would be aware that clothes featured on her personal social media accounts were manufactured by TALA. They said it was evident from the way she spoke about the clothing that TALA was her own brand, and that the level of detail she provided about the production and design elements of the items of clothing made it clear that she was involved in their creation and not a consumer. Ms Beverley’s representatives acknowledged that the purpose of ads (a) and (b) was to promote products she and her company TALA, had created. They said both ads were jointly posted as Instagram reels by Grace Beverley’s account and TALA’s account, as evidenced by the headnote on the reels stating “gracebeverley and wearetala”, which were clearly visible throughout the duration of the videos. Because the ads were also posted by TALA, which was a business page, Ms Beverley’s representatives believed the reels were obviously marketing communications when viewed in the context of an individual and a business jointly publishing the same video under a headnote. They believed text featured in ad (a), “give me less than a minute to tell you why this is the best coat the world has ever seen”, and similar text in ad (b), also made it clear they were ads.In addition, they said that in ads (a) and (b), Ms Beverley discussed the attributes of the products from the point of view of the person who created them, meaning viewers were left in no doubt about her association with TALA. For example, in ad (a), she said “… factories we literally had to beg at the door to get into”, and in ad (b), she said “[W]e don’t play around here”. They believed that, because she spoke in the first-person plural about the products, including specifically about the manufacturing process, the reels could not have been construed in any way other than as marketing communications. Although Ms Beverley’s representatives acknowledged that ads (c), (d), (e) and (f) were posted on her personal TikTok account, they believed the posts were obviously ads because, through the language she used, she was clearly a business owner talking about her own brand’s products. For example, in ad (e) she said “I wanted to make a bomber” and “I wanted to do another colour because we aced the fit so well.” They said ads (c), (d) and (e) featured on a playlist Ms Beverley curated, titled “aggressive marketing”, which she created specifically to ensure her posts were obviously identifiable as ads and therefore compliant with the Code. Playlists were a feature on TikTok which allowed some creators to categorise their public videos into playlists to make it easier for users to watch related videos in a series. However, we understood that those videos could also be served individually to users who did not follow Ms Beverley. They said ads (c) and (d) featured Ms Beverley, who again spoke in the first-person plural, modelling the products and clearly demonstrating their versatility from the point of view of the designer, which they believed signified TALA was her own brand. She also referenced the manufacturing process for the product in ad (d) when stating “[I]t is made in a factory”. In addition, in ad (f), they said Ms Beverley referenced the benefits of her ownership of the company when stating “[J]ust being able to make clothes that you wanted to buy and not really having to buy them”. She also referred to a business shoot the company did in ad (d). They said ad (e) featured Ms Beverley answering a question from another TikTok account about the attributes and cost of one of TALA’s products. She again spoke in the first-person plural. For example, she said “I don’t think I have ever been so proud about how one of our pieces has turned out”. They said the TALA TikTok account was tagged in the post, and believed that the language used in the caption and the fact that she had knowledge of the jacket’s release onto the market made it clear she was commercially linked to the jacket. They therefore believed it was clear that Ms Beverley was commercially linked to the TALA brand as opposed to having bought the coat as a consumer.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and that they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. The ASA first assessed whether or not the posts, which all promoted products by TALA, were marketing communications and whether they fell within the remit of the CAP Code. We understood that Grace Beverley was the founder and director of TALA, was remunerated as an employee of the business and therefore had a commercial relationship with the brand. We therefore considered that social media posts made by Grace Beverley in her capacity as an employee of the brand, which were directly connected with TALA’s products, constituted marketing communications in non-paid-for space, under the control of TALA, meaning both parties were responsible for ensuring the posts complied with the CAP Code. We next considered whether ads (a) and (b), which were Instagram reels, were obviously identifiable as marketing communications. We acknowledged that the ads contained some indicators that could have suggested that Ms Beverley had a commercial interest in the TALA brand. For example, she often spoke in the first-person plural, such as in ad (a), in which she said “[F]actories we literally had to beg at the door to get into” and in ad (b), in which she said, “[W]e don’t play around here”. While we acknowledged the language used by Ms Beverley could have suggested she had a commercial relationship with the TALA brand, the ads were several minutes long and those references were made part-way through, so a user was required to engage with the ads before they heard them. We therefore considered those phrases were insufficient to ensure the posts were obviously identifiable as ads. We understood the reels were jointly posted on Grace Beverley’s and TALA’s accounts, and that both parties had agreed to be co-publishers, which was a feature launched on Instagram in 2021. That meant the reels appeared in both parties’ feed and would have been seen by those who followed one of those accounts, even if they did not ‘follow’ the other, for example, through the ‘Explore’ function. We considered that some Instagram users would have been aware that both parties had posted the reels, due to the headnote which stated ‘gracebeverley and wearetala’ that appeared on-screen throughout, and that, as co-publishers, they were jointly promoting products sold by TALA. However, we also considered that some Instagram users would not have been aware of what ‘co-publishing’ was, or that its functionality required both parties to jointly agree to publish a post. We also considered that at least a significant proportion of users, especially those who did not follow the accounts, would not have known that the Instagram handle ‘wearetala’, referred to a brand and would not have understood from the headnotes that the posts were collaborations posted on an individual’s social media account to promote a brand’s products. We considered, in that context, the use of the co-publishing feature on Instagram was not enough to make either post obviously identifiable as an ad. For those reasons, we considered that the commercial intent behind ads (a) and (b) was not made immediately clear upfront and we concluded that those ads were not obviously identifiable as marketing communications.We next considered whether ads (c) to (f), which were TikTok posts, were obviously identifiable as marketing communications and whether they made clear their commercial intent. Ads (c) to (f) were published as posts on Ms Beverley’s own personal TikTok account. We understood that the posts would have been served to Ms Beverley’s followers, as well as TikTok users who did not follow her, for example through the ‘For you’ function. We acknowledged TALA’s view that, while some of Ms Beverley’s followers would have known that she was the founder and director of TALA, many of the users who would have been served the posts would not have known that fact. Although we acknowledged that the information in Ms Beverley’s TikTok bio informed consumers that she had a commercial relationship with TALA, her bio could not be seen without actively visiting her profile page. We considered that information in an individual’s social media bio did not amount to sufficient disclosure for individual ads. None of ads (d) to (f) contained an ad label such as #ad. We acknowledged that ads (d), (e) and (f) contained some indicators that could have suggested Ms Beverley had a commercial interest in the TALA brand. For example, she often spoke in the first-person plural, such as in ad (d), in which she said, “[W]e don’t play around here”, and in ad (e), in which she said “I don’t think I have ever been so proud about how one of our pieces has turned out”. She also referenced the manufacturing process of TALA products and her ownership of the company, for example, in ad (f) when stating “[J]ust being able to make clothes that you wanted to buy and not really having to buy them”. While we acknowledged the language used by Ms Beverley in those instances could have suggested she had a commercial relationship with the TALA brand, the ads were several minutes long and those references were made part-way through, so a user was required to engage with the ads before they heard them. We therefore considered those phrases alone were insufficient to ensure the posts were obviously identifiable as ads. We acknowledged that ad (e) tagged the TALA TikTok account and was posted in response to a question from another TikTok user, stating “How much is the reversible colour bomber jacket and can you do a video modelling that one too?”, which was featured in the post. However, we considered that this was not enough to make clear that she had a commercial interest in the TALA brand, as opposed to having purchased the jacket as a consumer. We therefore considered information in the video alone was insufficient to make the post obviously identifiable as a marketing communication, and that the caption also did not make it sufficiently clear the post was an ad. We also acknowledged that posts (c), (d) and (e) were on a playlist entitled “aggressive marketing”. However, we considered that it would not have been immediately obvious to users viewing the post what that meant and, given it was not a well-known phrase or method for disclosing ads, it could have been interpreted in different ways. For example, some users may have interpreted a video being on a “playlist” as being a reference to music. We therefore considered it was not sufficient to make the post obviously identifiable as an ad. We considered the cumulative effect of Ms Beverley’s social media biographies, the playlist and its title and the language she used within the posts, did not make sufficiently clear to TikTok users that they were ads. For those reasons, we considered that the commercial intent behind ads (c) to (f) was not made immediately clear upfront and we concluded that those ads were not obviously identifiable as marketing communications. Ads (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told We Are TALA Ltd and Grace Beverley to ensure their future ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications and the commercial intent was made clear, and that identifiers such as “#ad” were clearly and prominently displayed.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/we-are-tala-ltd-g23-1218988-we-are-tala-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Festival Free Bets,,"A post on Astrid Wett’s X (formerly Twitter) page, seen on 12 March 2024, for Festival Free Bets, a company which collated betting offers, featured an image of Astrid Wett at Cheltenham racecourse.","The complainant challenged whether the ad breached the rules on gambling advertising because it featured Astrid Wett, who was under 25 years old.","Festival Free Bets did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. Astrid Wett said she took matters of social responsibility seriously and understood the gravity of promoting responsible behaviour, especially regarding gambling. She said she was unaware of the age restrictions for ads for gambling services outlined in the CAP Code and assumed that being over 18 years old was sufficient to promote such content. She apologised for her breach of the Code and said she was committed to ensuring compliance with all relevant guidelines.","Upheld The ASA was concerned by Festival Free Bets' lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code and ruled that they had breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. In addition, that no one who was, or seemed to be, under 25 years old could be featured playing a significant role in marketing communications for gambling services, apart from marketing communications where a bet could be placed directly through a transactional facility, for instance, a gambling operator’s own website and the person is the subject of the bet. Although we acknowledged that Festival Free Bets was not itself a licensed gambling provider, using it would place consumers in a position where they would be interacting with gambling services. We therefore considered it would be irresponsible to feature someone who was aged under 25 playing a significant role in their ads. The image of Astrid Wett was the central focus of the ad and we considered that she therefore played a significant role in it. We understood she was 23 years old at the time the ad was published. Because the ad was for a service that was intended to facilitate gambling and featured someone who was aged under 25 playing a significant role, we concluded that it was irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Festival Free Bets to ensure they did not feature individuals who were, or seemed to be, under 25 years old playing a significant role in marketing communications for services that would lead consumers to interact with gambling providers. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/festival-free-bets-a24-1238072-festival-free-bets--unconfirmed-.html
ASA Ruling on Hangcure Ltd t/a Hangcure,,"A TikTok post on the ManCave Bartender account @mancavebartender, posted on 21 November 2023. The voice-over stated, “MAKING THE … ULTIMATE HANGOVER CURE”, while the song “Hangover” played in the background. It featured a bartender mixing various ingredients to make a drink. On-screen text then stated “NO NO NOOOO!!!”. He then pulled out two sachets of Hangcure Rebound. “JUST TAKE HANGCURE REBOUND, TAKE 2 CAPSULES BEFORE DRINKING”. He was then shown taking two of the pills. On-screen text stated “NO NEED FOR CRAZY REMEDIES ANYMORE”. The ad included a TikTok shop link on the video to purchase the Hangcure Rebound food supplement.

The ad included a label “Commission paid”.",,,"Upheld The Code prohibited claims that stated or implied a food or drink could prevent, treat or cure human disease. This also applied to product or brand names that included stated or implied claims that the food or drink product could prevent, treat or cure human disease. The ASA considered that a hangover and the symptoms associated with a hangover, such as nausea, dehydration, headache, vomiting and stomach upset, were adverse medical conditions, and as such, claims which stated or implied that a food or drink could prevent, treat or cure a hangover were prohibited under this rule. We considered that the claims “JUST TAKE HANGCURE REBOUND, TAKE 2 CAPSULES BEFORE DRINKING” and “NO NEED FOR CRAZY REMEDIES ANYMORE”, together with the caption which featured the hashtags “#hangcure #hangcurerebound #ultimatehangovercure […] #hangover #hangoverremedies”, would be understood by consumers to mean that the product could help to prevent a hangover. We further assessed the brand name Hangcure and the product name Hangcure Rebound. We considered that the word Hangcure would be understood by consumers to be a shorthand for ""hangover cure”, and would therefore be understood as a claim that the Hangcure Rebound product, and other products sold under the Hangcure brand name, could prevent or cure a hangover. The product and brand names were therefore a claim to prevent, treat or cure hangovers, which was prohibited by the Code. Because the ad included claims that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure a human disease, we concluded it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Hangcure Ltd not to make claims, which stated or implied a food or drink product could prevent, treat or cure hangovers, including in product and brand names.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/hangcure-ltd-a24-1228813-hangcure-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Prettylittlething.com Ltd t/a Prettylittlething.com,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","15 tweets from PrettyLittleThing on their X (formerly Twitter) page, posted between Thursday 23 and Tuesday 28 November 2023, with similar ads posted on their other social media accounts: a.

Prettylittlething.com Ltd t/a PrettyLittleThing said the Black Friday period had become well known to consumers in the UK as a period when businesses offered promotions. They said their customers were value-oriented and their advertising and marketing was reflective of what their customers wanted and expected. They said they always tried to include significant conditions to promotions in ads, but sometimes space was limited. They included information such as end dates and an asterisk with qualifying information where possible. Detailed further terms and conditions were on their website, which customers could review ahead of any purchase.","1. Upheld Ads (a), (b), (k), (l), (m) and (o) stated “[X]% Off Everything*” and ad (d) stated “Get 40% off EVERY SINGLE THING*”, but the asterisks did not link to any qualifying information. Ads (i) and (n) also featured the headline claim “[X]% Off Everything*” and included the qualifying information “*Excl Sale and Beauty” in the caption. Ads (f) and (h) featured the same headline and qualifying information, but it appeared at the bottom of the images in font so small the ASA considered most consumers would overlook it. We considered ads (f) and (h) therefore breached the Code because the qualifications were not presented clearly. Notwithstanding that, we considered consumers would understand from the headline claims referencing “everything” and “every single thing”, in all those ads, that the promotions included all products sold by PrettyLittleThing. While five of the ads included qualifying information that sale and beauty items were excluded, we considered they were not sufficient to counter the overriding impression of the ads that all products would be discounted by the stated percentage. Ad (e) referred to a discount code only being available for a further three hours, and ad (j) referred to a “99% OFF” promotion being available for one hour, starting in one hour’s time. Neither ad included any information about what product lines were included or excluded. We considered such information constituted significant conditions and limitations, which were likely to influence consumers’ decision and understanding about the promotions and were therefore material information that should have been included in the ads. In the absence of any information to that effect, we considered consumers would understand from the ads that all products sold by PrettyLittleThing were included in the promotions. Ad (g) included the text “YOU ASKED FOR IT 99% off 1000’S OF LINES”. In the absence of information about any exclusions, we considered consumers would understand from the ad that the promotion included product lines across all product types. We understood that the discount code promotions in all the ads referenced above excluded product lines categorised by PrettyLittleThing as “Beauty” products and all products that were already on sale. Because the ads stated or implied that all product lines sold by PrettyLittleThing were included in the promotions, or made clear that not all lines were included but implied product lines across all product types were included, when that was not the case, we concluded the ads were misleading. On that point, ads (a), (b), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (m), (n) and (o) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 and 3.10 (Qualification), 8.17 and 8.17.1 (Significant conditions for promotions). 2. & 3. Upheld The CAP Code required that promotions must be conducted equitably and promoters must be seen to deal fairly and honourably with participants and potential participants, and avoid causing unnecessary disappointment. Closing dates for promotions must be included in marketing communications if they were likely to influence consumers’ decision or understanding about the promotion. Promoters must be able to demonstrate that the absence of a closing date would not disadvantage consumers. Closing dates must not be changed unless unavoidable circumstances beyond the promoter’s control made it necessary and either to not change the date would be unfair to those who sought to participate within the original terms, or those who sought to participate within the original terms would not be disadvantaged by the change. Over the seven-day period between Thursday 23 and Thursday 30 November, which included Black Friday, PrettyLittleThing posted a large number of ads referencing discounts. This included but was not limited to the 15 ads described above. Many consumers who followed PrettyLittleThing on social media would have anticipated that they would run a Black Friday-branded promotion, and that this could potentially last for up to several days, as this was increasingly common in the retail sector. They would have understood the references in the ads to “Pink Friday” and “Pink Monday” as referring to PrettyLittleThing’s Black Friday-branded promotional period. Over the seven-day period the advertised discounts ranged between 30% and 99%. Some ads advertised promotions with a higher percentage discount than the immediately preceding promotion (for example, ads (b) and (m)); others advertised a lower discount (for example, ads (c) and (l)). The promotions all ran back-to-back with no return to non-discounted selling prices except for a few hours overnight, the one exception being that there appeared to be no promotions running on Sunday 26 November. We considered consumers would expect that by participating in a price discount promotion they would achieve a genuine saving compared to the usual selling prices, and that prices would revert to the usual selling prices when the promotion ended. As such, for promotional mechanisms which used discount codes that were applied at checkout, they would not expect the promotion to be immediately followed by another, particularly if it offered a higher discount. We also considered that where marketers conducted promotions, higher prices should in general have been charged for a longer duration than the promotional price. Because that was not the case, we considered the advertised promotions were misleading and had not been conducted equitably and that PrettyLittleThing had not dealt fairly and honourably with participants and potential participants. Additionally, some of the ads did not make clear how long the promotional period lasted (for example, ads (d) and (k)). PrettyLittleThing had not demonstrated that the absence of a closing date/time did not disadvantage consumers and we considered those ads therefore breached the Code on that basis. Some ads implied that a discount would end at the stated closing date/time only for the following ad to continue the same promotional discount (for example, ads (e) and (f)), or one with such a negligible difference between the percentages that we considered they effectively continued the same promotion: ad (a) stated that a 30% discount would end at 12 pm, but ad (b), posted at 12 pm, introduced a slightly higher discount of 33%, before ad (c) returned the discount to 30% at 3 pm. Further, some ads stated or implied that a discount would last for a specific period of time only for an ad posted later the same day to introduce a much higher discount for a short time during the original promotion (for example, ads (f) and (g), and (i) and (j)). Others extended a previous promotional period: ad (h) extended the Pink Friday promotion to Saturday, and ad (l) extended the Pink Monday promotion to Tuesday. We considered those examples amounted to PrettyLittleThing misleading consumers as to the closing/date times of the promotions, or changing them, which was only permitted in instances when unavoidable circumstances beyond the promoter’s control made it necessary. We had not seen evidence that such circumstances had arisen and therefore considered the ads also breached the Code in those regards. Finally, ad (i), which announced Pink Monday and featured the discount code “FINAL40” and stated a closing time of 9 pm, implied that it would be the last promotion in the Black Friday period. However, further promotions followed in ads (j) to (o). Similarly, ad (g) announced a 99% discount “For one hour ONLY” on Black Friday, which implied it would not be repeated. However, it was repeated on Black Monday. We considered those ads were therefore misleading. They were also likely to pressure consumers into making swift transactional decisions, including purchasing products, without giving their purchase the due consideration they otherwise would. For the reasons set out above we concluded the promotions were not conducted equitably and fairly and that the ads were misleading and breached the Code. On those points, ads (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (m), (n) and (o) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification), 3.17 (Prices), and 8.2, 8.17, 8.17.1, 8.17.4, 8.17.4.a, 8.17.4.c and 8.17.4.e (Significant conditions for promotions).","The ads must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Prettylittlething.com Ltd t/a PrettyLittleThing to ensure their ads did not state or imply that a promotion included all product lines they sold, including by stating that a promotion related to “everything” or “every single thing”, if that was not the case. We also told them to ensure that ads which did make clear that not all product lines were included in a promotion did not imply that product lines across all product types were included, if that was not the case. They must ensure that ads stated significant conditions to promotions, and that qualifications were presented clearly. We told them to ensure their ads did not mislead as to the closing date/time of promotions, or imply that discount offers were time-limited or would not be repeated if that was not the case. They must include closing dates/times of promotions in ads unless they could demonstrate their absence would not disadvantage consumers, and must not change promotion closing dates unless unavoidable circumstances outside their control made it necessary. We told them to ensure they conducted their promotions equitably and dealt fairly and honourably with participants and potential participants.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/prettylittlething-com-ltd-a23-1224573-prettylittlething-com-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Tonic Nutrition Ltd t/a Tonic Health,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website and an Instagram reel for Tonic Health, an online retailer of vitamin supplements: a. The website www.tonichealth.co, seen on 30 November 2023, featured a product listing for the “Daily Immunity” supplement. The listing stated “No Added Sugar, No Junk, Vegan”. A table comparing the Daily Immunity product with various competitor products including Berocca, titled “Vitamins (grams per daily serving)”, showed that the Daily Immunity product contained 3433 mg of vitamins, which was significantly higher than the other products listed in the table. Text next to the table stated “Optimal nutrition. Naturally. We out-vitamin the competition so you can upgrade your health game”. The same table was featured again further down the web page, with text next to it stating “Dump the Junk. Dump the sugars, chemicals and fillers. It’s a simple solution to make you feel you”. b. The Instagram reel posted on Tonic Health’s Instagram page, seen on 15 March 2024, featured a video of a man standing next to Berocca products on a shelf in a supermarket. He said, “Big pharma are coming for us, check this out, the bad boys Berocca sent an official complaint to the ASA because they don’t like the fact that we’re telling you what’s in their product and what the facts are for what’s healthy. Berocca Immuno here is £8 for a tube at 53p per for tablet but Tonic’s only 45p per tablet, you get more vitamins and no artificial sweeteners so a much better way to go for your health than Berocca. And they don’t like it. They don’t want to look after your health like we do, so go get your Tonic and look after your health.”","Bayer plc, who manufactured the product Berocca, challenged whether: 1. the implied nutrition and comparative nutrition claims in ad (a) in relation to the vitamins contained in the Daily Immunity product and Berocca, breached the Code; 2. the phrase “dump the sugars” in ad (a) was a comparative nutrition claim that breached the Code; and 3. ads (a) and (b) discredited or denigrated another product.","1. Tonic Nutrition t/a Tonic Health did not believe that the table in ad (a), which claimed that the total amount of vitamins in the Daily Immunity product was 3433 mg, was a nutrition claim. They also believed that comparing the total amount of vitamins in their product against competitor products, including Berocca, was not a comparative nutrition claim. They said that by simply adding up the amount of active ingredients in each of the named products, they provided consumers with a clear and easy way to understand what they were buying. They acknowledged that they should not have included certain ingredients, such as reishi mushrooms, which they acknowledged were not vitamins, in the Daily Immunity’s stated total amount of vitamins. Although that meant the figure of 3433 mg was incorrect, they said the purpose of the ad was to present factual evidence so that consumers knew what was in their product. 2. Tonic Health acknowledged that although Berocca contained sweeteners, it did not include sugars, and said they would remove the phrase “dump the sugars” from ad (a). They said they would also remove references to “sugars” from the table in ad (a) to ensure there was no confusion between sugars and sweeteners. 3. Tonic Health said that the phrase “dump the junk” in ad (a) was included to highlight sugar and artificial ingredients as ‘junk food’, which they believed was a generic term accepted by consumers and the industry to mean food that had low nutritional value, typically produced in the form of packaged snacks which required little or no preparation. They said they would remove ads (a) and (b) and intended to make wider changes across their advertising.","1. Upheld Only nutrition claims authorised on the Great Britain Nutrition and Health Claims Register (the GB Register) could be made in ads promoting food or drink products. The Code defined a nutrition claim as any claim which stated, suggested or implied that a food (or drink) had particular beneficial nutritional properties due to the amount of calories, nutrients or other substances it contained, did not contain, or contained in reduced or increased proportions. In addition, the advertiser must ensure that the product met the conditions of use associated with the authorised claim. Ad (a) featured a table titled “Vitamins (grams per daily serving)”, which compared the claimed total amount of vitamins in the Daily Immunity product against the total amount of vitamins in various competitor products, including Bayer plc’s product, Berocca. The table stated the Daily Immunity product contained 3,433 mg of vitamins, which the ASA considered consumers would understand as meaning that the Daily Immunity product was high in a range of vitamins. Notwithstanding that the claim was misleading because the stated amount included substances that were not vitamins, for example, reishi mushrooms, we noted there was no authorised generalised ‘high in vitamins’ nutrition claim on the GB Register. We also considered consumers were likely to understand from the table that the Daily Immunity product contained more vitamins overall than the competitor products. We considered that claim had the same meaning as the authorised comparative nutrition claim “increased [name of nutrient]”. However, that claim could only be used in relation to a specific named nutrient (rather than ‘vitamins’ generally), and the conditions of use stated in the GB Register required that the claim could only be used where the nutrients compared were not vitamins or minerals. We therefore considered ad (a) made both a nutrition claim and a comparative nutrition claim for the purposes of the Code. However, neither claim was authorised on the GB Register. We concluded the ad breached the Code on that basis. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 2. Upheld The GB Register stated that a claim stating that the content of one or more nutrients had been reduced, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be made where the reduction in content was at least 30% compared to a similar product. The claim “reduced sugars"", and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be made if the amount of energy of the product bearing the claim was equal to or less than the amount of energy in a similar product. Ad (a) featured text which stated “dump the sugars” next to a table comparing the Daily Immunity product to Berocca, as well as several other products. We considered consumers would understand the ad to be a favourable comparison between the Daily Immunity product, which was sugar free, and the claimed sugar content of the products listed in the table. We therefore considered the ad made a “reduced sugars” comparative nutrition claim. However, we understood that although Berocca contained artificial sweeteners, the ad misrepresented its sugar content; it did not contain sugars. Because the Daily Immunity product did not contain less sugar than Berocca, the ad included a comparative nutrition claim that did not meet the conditions of use associated with the permitted claim, and we therefore concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 3. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not discredit or denigrate another product or marketer. The rule applied irrespective of whether or not a claim was true, if it appeared in a comparative advertisement and was expressed in terms which were insulting, derogatory or demeaning. Ads which included comparisons with competitors which went beyond a robust and objective comparison of their products or services risked breaching that rule. Ad (a) featured a table that claimed to show the total amount of vitamins (in grams per daily serving) in various nutritional supplements, including Tonic Health’s Daily Immunity product and Bayer plc’s Berocca product. The table was accompanied by a heading which stated “Dump the Junk” and text which stated “Dump the sugars, chemicals and fillers. It’s a simple solution to make you feel you”. Ad (b) featured a video in which a man held and talked about the Berocca Immuno product. During the video, he referred to Berocca as “bad boys”. He also said “… they don’t like the fact that we’re telling you what’s in their product and what the facts are for what’s healthy” and “They don’t want to look after your health like we do”. We considered the phrase “dump the junk” in ad (a) and accompanying references to “sugars, chemicals and fillers”, next to the comparison table, implied the Daily Immunity product was of a higher quality due to it having a higher vitamin content and being without the “sugars, chemicals and fillers” of the competitor products, and that accordingly consumers should avoid those competitor products. We considered the term “junk” in that context to be a pejorative comment which suggested consumers should avoid purchasing Berocca or the other competitor products as they were of little to no value as supplements. We considered that those comments went beyond a factual and informative comparison about the relative nutritional value of the products. For those reasons, we considered ad (a) denigrated or discredited another product. We considered the claims in ad (b) “… the bad boys Berocca sent an official complaint to the ASA because they don’t like the fact that we’re telling you what’s in their product and what the facts are for what’s healthy” and “They don’t want to look after your health like we do” implied that Berocca’s producers, Bayer plc, were not motivated by a desire to improve the health of its consumers and that they had launched an ASA complaint against Tonic Health in an attempt to restrain Tonic Health from informing consumers about the products’ relative nutritional/health value. We considered those comments, which were unverified and implied negative motivations by Bayer plc, also went beyond a factual and informative comparison about the relative nutritional value of the products and were denigratory about Berocca. We therefore concluded that the ads discredited and denigrated Berocca and breached the Code. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.42 (Imitation and Denigration).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Tonic Nutrition t/a Tonic Health to ensure that they did not make nutrition or comparative nutrition claims unless they were authorised on the GB Register. We also told them to ensure they did not discredit or denigrate Bayer plc’s or their other competitors’ products.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/tonic-nutrition-ltd-a23-1224570-tonic-nutrition-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on ProgressPlay Ltd,,"A website for Jeffbet, www.jeffbet.com, seen on 21 November 2023, featured a “BET £10 AND GET £30 FREE BET” promotion on the homepage. Terms and conditions stated “New Players Only” in small text and included a link to the full terms and conditions.","The complainant, who was not eligible for the promotion despite being a new JeffBet customer, challenged whether the ad was misleading.","ProgressPlay Ltd t/a JeffBet said that they ensured promotional ads included as much detail as possible with regards to the terms and conditions of any promotion so that consumers could make an informed decision about whether or not to participate. They believed that, for the ad in question, there was not enough space to highlight that the promotional offer was only available to those who were new to the ProgressPlay network. Instead, they included that information in the terms and conditions, which could be found upon clicking the text “Full Terms Apply” in the ad. They provided a screenshot of those promotional terms and conditions; the ninth point stated “Any player can receive up to 1 (one) sport welcome bonus on the Progressplay Network”. Jeffbet highlighted that further down the page, linked to from the ad, additional “Jeffbet Terms and Conditions” could be found, which detailed the definition of “Progressplay Network” as defined in the promotional terms and conditions. A further link was provided which listed ProgressPlay’s related brands. They reiterated that the ad did not have sufficient space to detail that the welcome bet related to the whole ProgressPlay network, rather than Jeffbet itself, or to include all of the related network brands.","Upheld The ASA noted that the ad, seen on the Jeffbet website, stated the promotional offer was open to “New Players Only”. We considered that consumers would understand from that text, and the context in which it was seen, that only those who did not already have a Jeffbet account were entitled to redeem the promotional offer. Furthermore, we noted that the “New Players Only” stipulation was listed in small print, alongside other terms and conditions of the promotion, such as the length of the promotion and the maximum pay out. We therefore considered consumers would understand that the text “New Players Only” referred to a full term or condition of the promotion and we considered that reinforced the impression that only new JeffBet customers were eligible for the promotion. We noted that Jeffbet did not believe there was sufficient space in the ad to include the full detail of that promotional condition and because of that, they linked to the full terms and conditions in the ad. However, because the ad was placed on the Jeffbet website, we considered that the ad was not constrained by space or functionality requirements, and there was ample space to state any information which would be material to consumers in relation to the offer. We considered that any condition which defined the eligibility for the promotion would be significant to participants when making a decision to sign up to the offer, and therefore should be prominently displayed. Furthermore, we understood that the “New Players Only” promotional offer applied to new customers of the ProgressPlay network, rather than new Jeffbet customers. We considered that this was material information which should have been made clear in the ad. In addition, we considered that consumers were unlikely to understand the term “ProgressPlay Network”. The ad should, therefore, have also stipulated that ProgressPlay owned a number of gambling websites, including Jeffbet, and that if any potential participant was already a customer with one of their other gambling platforms, then they would not be eligible for the offer. We considered, at a minimum, the ad should have included a prominent and accessible link to where consumers could find a list of all ProgressPlay owned gambling sites. Because the ad gave the impression that all new Jeffbet customers were eligible for the promotion when that was not the case, we concluded that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 8.17, 8.17.1, 8.17.7 (Promotional marketing).","The ad must not appear in its current form. We told ProgressPlay Ltd t/a Jeffbet to ensure that they did not misleadingly imply that customers could redeem a promotion if they were not eligible for it, and that significant conditions were not omitted from promotions.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/progressplay-ltd-a23-1223286-progressplay-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Tecnología Sostenible y Responsable SL (TSR) t/a Sustainable and Responsible Technology SL,,"A paid-for X (formerly Twitter) ad for Reticare, a manufacturer of blue-violet light digital screen and eyeglass filters, seen on 30 July 2023, stated “Did you know, for the 1st time in history, Reticare discovered and scientifically proved the fact that screen lights damage your eyes and showed the proper way to solve it? [sic] Based on over 20 years of research. Reticare is the world leader in protection against blue light”.",The complainant challenged whether the claim that blue light from screens could cause damage to the eyes of humans was misleading and could be substantiated.,"Tecnología Sostenible y Responsable SL (TSR) t/a Reticare said their products had been developed in partnership with the Complutense University of Madrid’s Research Group into Vision and Ophthalmology. Their work had demonstrated the negative effects that blue light could have on the human eye. They provided two patents and a clinical study, which they said established the harm caused by blue light and showed their products limited its negative effects, and three studies which they said detailed how the amount of time exposed to light emitting diodes (LED) impacted damage to the retina.","Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim ""Reticare discovered and scientifically proved the fact that screen lights damage your eyes"", in the context of the ad which referred to “protection against blue light”, as meaning the blue light from digital screens could cause irreparable damage to the eyes and/or eyesight and that protection from it was warranted. We considered the advertiser should therefore hold robust scientific evidence in support of the claim. However, when we assessed the evidence provided by Reticare, we considered that it did not meet the standard of evidence required for the type of claim being made. We assessed the clinical study. It examined the effects of blue light emitted from LED tablet screens on rats and whether a short wavelength filter produced by Reticare effectively modified the light’s impact. In the absence of supporting evidence showing its relevance, we considered the study, which involved animals rather than people, was not adequate substantiation for the claim. We next assessed the patents. The first referred to a filter with a pigment applied to it that blocked short light wavelengths of between 380 and 500 nanometres (nm). The patent outlined an experiment that had been conducted to establish the effectiveness of the filter at blocking blue light and preventing apoptosis and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. The in vitro experiment exposed retinal pigment epithelium cell cultures to LED light for 12-hour periods. The experiment’s findings suggested the cell cultures were damaged by the light and that the filter limited that damage. The second patent was for a diopter with a refractive surface that blocked short and medium wavelengths of light between 380 and 590 nm. It outlined an experiment that was conducted to test the efficacy of two diopters, one that blocked short and medium wavelengths of light between 380 and 590 nm and one that blocked short wavelengths of light between 380 and 500 nm, at preventing mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. The experiment placed the diopters between in vitro retinal pigment epithelium cell cultures and an LED light for 12 hours. The experiment’s findings suggested the diopter had a protective effect over the cell cultures. The experiments outlined in the patents suggested LED light had an effect on the cell cultures. However, we considered the design of the experiments, which involved uninterrupted exposure to the light source for a significant amount of time, meant they did not likely reflect how consumers would typically engage with an LED screen. Additionally, the experiments’ results had not been independently verified. We therefore considered they were not adequate substantiation for the claim.We reviewed the studies. The first study exposed in vitro cell cultures to a tungsten halogen light source. As the light source in the experiment was different to that of a digital screen, we considered the study was not adequate substantiation for the claim. The second study examined exposure time as a factor in the effect of blue light on the eye. It did so by exposing in vitro cell cultures to the light and assessing the damage that occurred. Damage occurred after six hours of continuous exposure. We considered that as the study involved uninterrupted exposure to a source of light for a significant amount of time, it was not necessarily representative of how consumers would engage with an LED screen. The third study also used in vitro cell cultures. The results detailed the damage of blue light on the cell cultures, but were derived from random sampling with the aim of establishing a blue light damage model for future experiments. We therefore considered those studies were not adequate substantiation for the claim. As the body of evidence provided was not adequate substantiation for the claim that blue light from digital screens could cause damage to the eyes of humans, we concluded it was likely to mislead and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Tecnología Sostenible y Responsable SL (TSR) t/a Reticare not to make claims that the blue light from screens damage the eyes of humans, and that protection from it was warranted, in the absence of adequate substantiation.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/tecnologia-sostenible-y-responsable-sl--tsr--a23-1207275-tecnologia-sostenible-y-responsable-sl.html
ASA Ruling on Independent British Vape Trade Association t/a IBVTA,,"A press advertorial from the Independent British Vape Trade Association (IBVTA) seen in the East Lothian Courier on 26 October 2023, featured the headline “Let’s clear the smoke of confusion: Vaping saves smokers’ lives”. The article contained an image of the Chair of the IBVTA, standing in front of a billboard that stated, “Vaping instead of smoking, helps saves smokers’ lives”. Further text in the image of the poster stated “Always buy from reputable retailers”. Text in the ad stated, “a constant stream of negative headlines is eroding the public’s understanding of vaping’s benefits, particularly among smokers”. Further text stated, “the IBVTA is now seeking to challenge some of the misinformation we’ve seen over recent months and to educate smokers about the benefits of vaping”. Further text stated, “the IBVTA, representing the UK’s leading independent vape manufacturers, importers, distributors, and vendors, is launching a major national public information campaign to meet this responsibility. This campaign is accompanied by substantial new consumer insights that provide a comprehensive view of vaping, its various devices, and how smokers are using them to quit”. Further text stated, “Our research uncovers the different types of vaping devices used by smokers at various stages of their quitting journey”. Further text stated, “Single-use vapes, due to their user-friendly nature, play a crucial role in the initial transition away from tobacco, with 53% of regular smokers and 61% of recent ex-smokers using single use devices […] This transition further underscores the vital role that vaping, in all its forms, plays in helping smokers quit and preventing relapses”. A further paragraph stated, “It should also reflect the compelling evidence that vaping, particularly when using flavoured devices, is pivotal in achieving the Scottish Government’s smoke-free ambitions”. Text at the end of the ad stated, “For more information about the campaign and the research supporting it, please visit www.ibvta.org.uk/explorethefacts”.","The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code by promoting unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components in a newspaper.","The Independent British Vape Trade Association t/a IBVTA said they were a trade body and not-for-profit organisation funded by independent vaping businesses, and that they did not sell or supply vaping products of any type, and therefore did not promote any specific brand or vaping product. They stated the ad presented factual information about vaping and presented findings from a piece of research about consumers’ views on vaping. They highlighted that the ad was published during a time of public misunderstanding of vaping harms, including that vaping was more harmful than smoking. They did not believe the ad had the indirect effect of promoting unlicensed nicotine-containing e-cigarettes because it did not reference a specific brand or vaping product, and that the ad merely highlighted consumer research or publicly available information regarding misunderstanding about vaping harms. They said the ad was factual, not promotional, in nature and only presented information that could be readily substantiated. Regarding the claim “Always buy from reputable retailers”, they said that this statement was a reminder to buy from a reputable retailer, rather than retailers who were trading illicit products, or were otherwise breaking the law. The IBVTA said the agency who had prepared the ad on their behalf had submitted the ad to the CAP Copy Advice team, and they did not believe that they had raised its publication in a newspaper as an issue. LOCALiQ, the agency that manages the ad space in the East Lothian Courier, responded on their behalf. They confirmed that they had not received any further complaints directly about the ad. LOCALiQ said the agency working on behalf of the IBVTA had confirmed to them that they had sought a view from the CAP Copy Advice team, who advised that the claims in the ad would need to be able to be substantiated. LOCALiQ received evidence to substantiate it and so accepted the ad on that basis.","Upheld CAP Code rule 22.12 reflected a legislative ban contained in the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations (TRPR) on the advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes in certain media. The rule stated that, except for media targeted exclusively to the trade, marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components that were not licensed as medicines were not permitted in newspapers, magazines and periodicals, or in online media and some other forms of electronic media. The ad was published in a local Scottish newspaper in response to the Scottish Government’s proposal to ban the sale of disposable vapes by 2025. The ad promoted e-cigarettes generally, and the ASA considered a number of those would be unlicensed as medicines for the purposes of rule 22.12. However, we noted the ad did not reference a specific brand of vape or vaping product and as such, we considered the ad did not have the direct effect of promoting unlicensed nicotine-containing e-cigarettes. We therefore considered whether the ad had the indirect effect of promoting such products. We acknowledged that the agency who had prepared the ad had consulted with the CAP Copy Advice team prior to publication. We understood they had advised that legal advice be sought as to whether the TRPR would apply to this ad, which was reflected by CAP Code rule 22.12. The ad highlighted that IBVTA were using their information campaign to “educate smokers about the benefits of vaping”. We considered the ad emphasised one of those benefits was smoking cessation; text in the ad stated, “how smokers are using them to quit”, “vaping devices used by smokers at various stages of their quitting journey” and “the vital role that vaping, in all its forms, plays in helping smokers quit and preventing relapses”. That impression was reinforced by the claim “It should also reflect the compelling evidence that vaping, particularly when using flavoured devices, is pivotal in achieving the Scottish Government’s smoke-free ambitions” and “Single-use vapes, due to their user-friendly nature, play a crucial role in the initial transition away from tobacco”. We considered that readers would understand those claims referred to nicotine-containing e-cigarettes because they were associated with stopping smoking. As such, we considered the ad had the indirect effect of promoting those types of e-cigarettes. The ad also discussed the wider benefits of using e-cigarettes; the ad stated “a constant stream of negative headlines is eroding the public’s understanding of vaping’s benefits, particularly among smokers” which we considered was a claim inclusive of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and suggested that vaping had further health benefits to smokers and non-smokers alike. As such, we considered that claim also had the indirect effect of promoting unlicensed nicotine-containing e-cigarettes. We noted the ad contained a link to the IBVTA website to allow consumers to find out further information about the campaign. We noted that the website also listed retailers and vendors of vapes that were members of the IBVTA and had a ‘Find a vape shop’ feature, where consumers could find a nearby retailer. We considered that had the further effect of indirectly promoting unlicensed nicotine-containing e-cigarettes as consumers would be able to use the IBVTA website to purchase such products. Text in the image of the poster in the ad also stated, “Always buy from reputable retailers”, which we considered further encouraged readers to access the website and “Find a vape shop” feature. Because the ad had the indirect effect of promoting e-cigarettes, which were not licensed as medicines in non-permitted media, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 22.12 (Electronic cigarettes).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told the Independent British Vape Trade Association t/a IBVTA that marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components, which were not licensed as medicines, should not be published in a newspaper that is not covered by the exception to media targeted exclusively to the trade.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/independent-british-vape-trade-association-a23-1219004-independent-british-vape-trade-association.html
ASA Ruling on Lark Holdings Limited,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","The website homepage www.serenity-method.com, for The Serenity Method, seen on 14 November 2023, claimed “ENDING ANXIETY FOR THOUSANDS” and included a button “WATCH OUR FREE TRAINING”. Further text included “Ready to BUY The Serenity Method?” and “I want to introduce you to a new breakthrough in treating anxiety disorders. My name is Lawrence Leyton and I’m an expert on anxiety, panic attacks, and phobias. I’ve had many prime-time TV shows based around my unique techniques”. The button redirected to a page that stated “DISCOVER HOW ‘COGNITIVE DELETION’ CAN PERMANENTLY ELIMINATE ANXIETY IN LESS THAN 14 DAYS”. An embedded video on the page featured Mr Leyton, labelled as an “Anxiety, Panic Attack & Phobia Expert” who stated, “In this video today, I’m going to share how an unorthodox new method will permanently remove anxiety out of your life in 14 days or less […] this unique method, which is called ‘Cognitive Deletion’, has already helped thousands of people around the world to permanently eliminate anxiety… any type of anxiety, social anxiety, health anxiety, OCD and even PTSD, so there’s no reason why it won’t work for you too. Many people don’t realise that they have General Anxiety […] And once you address it, you’ll wake up every day with a smile on your face, springing out of bed full of energy, motivated and most importantly, happy. […] The reason why ‘Cognitive Deletion’ works so fast and is so effective is because it’s the only method that stops overthinking, and if you’re not overthinking your anxiety disappears. It’s that simple […] ‘Cognitive Deletion’ is far superior to CBT, hypnosis, medication, or any other form of talking therapy because those therapies don’t stop you overthinking, they just make you acutely aware of your thoughts, and in some ways, they amplify them […] In fact, the only way to permanently eliminate anxiety is ‘Cognitive Deletion’ […]” Later in the video Mr Leyton described how he had helped people with a fear of flying. The video also featured examples of two groups of people, described as having “severe anxiety related to heights” and “extreme anxiety about small spaces”, before Cognitive Deletion cured them of those phobias. A woman described how her social anxiety, which included suffering from panic attacks, was cured. Text below the ad stated, “An unorthodox new method called; ‘Cognitive Deletion’ has already helped thousands of people around the world to permanently eliminate anxiety... any type of anxiety, social anxiety, health, anxiety, OCD and even PTSD, so there’s no reason why it won’t work for you too […]”.","The complainant challenged whether: 1. the claim that The Serenity Method could permanently eliminate anxiety, panic attacks and phobias in less than 14 days was misleading and could be substantiated; and 2. the ad discouraged essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought, namely OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).",1. & 2. Lark Holdings Ltd t/a The Serenity Method did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Lark Holdings Ltd t/a The Serenity Method’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. 1. Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claims “ENDING ANXIETY FOR THOUSANDS” and “DISCOVER HOW ‘COGNITIVE DELETION’ CAN PERMANENTLY ELIMINATE ANXIETY IN LESS THAN 14 DAYS!” to mean that The Serenity Method programme was capable of permanently eliminating anxiety in less than 14 days. The homepage directed to a video, which included the further claims “I’m going to share how an unorthodox new method will permanently remove anxiety out of your life in 14 days or less. […] ‘Cognitive Deletion’ has already helped thousands of people around the world to permanently eliminate anxiety… any type of anxiety”, and “in fact, the only way to permanently eliminate anxiety is ‘Cognitive Deletion’”. We considered that the further claims featured in the video, in addition to the accompanying text “‘Cognitive Deletion’ has already helped thousands of people around the world to permanently eliminate anxiety... any type of anxiety […]” further reinforced the above impression, which would be understood by consumers to be relevant to all types of anxiety. The website’s homepage included the claim that Lawrence Leyton “taught over 10,000 phobics how to overcome their fear of flying” and that he was an expert on “phobias” and the video made similar references. Additionally, the video featured footage of groups of people who were described as having “severe anxiety related to heights” and “extreme anxiety about small spaces”. ‘Before’ and ‘after’ footage showed them initially exhibiting extreme distress when exposed to heights or small spaces, and then being relaxed and calm in the same situations. We considered that in the context of the ad consumers would understand that The Serenity Method programme and Cognitive Deletion could cure phobias such as aerophobia, acrophobia and claustrophobia in 14 days or less. Mr Leyton was also described as an expert on panic attacks, and the video featured a woman who described suffering from panic attacks as a symptom of her social anxiety. We considered that in the context of the ad, consumers would understand that The Serenity Method programme and Cognitive Deletion could cure panic attacks in 14 days or less. We therefore expected to see robust documentary evidence substantiating the claims to treat or cure anxiety, phobias and panic attacks, consisting of clinical trials conducted on people. However, we received no evidence from the advertiser to substantiate that the Serenity Method programme and Cognitive Deletion were capable of permanently eliminating any type of anxiety, phobias or panic attacks in less than 14 days (or at all). In the absence of such evidence, we concluded that the claims had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketers must not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. For example, they must not offer specific advice on, diagnosis or treatment for such conditions unless that advice, diagnosis or treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. The ad included several references to The Serenity Method programme and Cognitive Deletion being an effective treatment for OCD and PTSD. The ASA considered that these were conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. Because The Serenity Method had not supplied evidence that showed that their programme was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional, we concluded that the ad discouraged essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought, and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.2 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Lark Holdings Ltd t/a The Serenity Method to ensure they did not make claims that stated or implied that they could permanently eliminate anxiety, panic attacks and phobias in less than 14 days. We also told them not to make claims that discouraged essential treatment for a condition for which medical supervision should be sought, including the conditions OCD and PTSD.

"ASA Ruling on Whitbread Group plc t/a Premier Inn, Beefeater",,"A paid-for search ad for Premier Inn, seen on 4 November 2023, stated, “Premier Inn Edinburgh - Rooms From Only £35 Per Night”.","The complainant, who could not find any rooms in Edinburgh at the advertised price, challenged whether the claim in the ad was misleading and could be substantiated.","Whitbread Group PLC t/a Premier Inn provided data that showed that for 365 days, from 8 am on 4 November 2023, there were 112 live opportunities - “site nights” - to book a hotel room in Edinburgh for £35 within their booking window. They provided a table that outlined the spread of availability of hotel rooms in Edinburgh at £35 within that window. The table demonstrated there had been 377 site nights available at £35 in the booking window, which they considered a significant spread. Premier Inn said they provided training on responsible advertising, including around availability and appropriate targeting of ads. They had removed the challenged claim so that the complaint could be properly investigated and so they could fully scrutinise their data.","Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “Premier Inn Edinburgh - Rooms From Only £35 Per Night” as meaning that a significant proportion of rooms available across the proceeding 365 days would be available at £35. We reviewed the table of data provided. It outlined that only a small percentage of site nights had rooms on offer for £35. We therefore concluded the claim “Premier Inn Edinburgh - Rooms From Only £35 Per Night” had not been substantiated and was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.17, and 3.22 (Prices).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Dr Bunny Aesthetics,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A listing for Dr Bunny Aesthetics, a cosmetic surgery practitioner, was seen 31 October 2023 on Fresha, an appointment booking service for beauty businesses. The page featured a cropped image of a close-up face with a section below titled “Services”. The section contained a list of different treatment options and included a box with the text “Anti Wrinkle/Botulinium Toxin […] from £50”. The box linked through to a booking page that contained the treatment description “Anti-ageing treatment is prepared from botulin […] for younger, more fresh looking skin” along with associated treatment prices that linked through to an appointment calendar. Further text on the listing in a section titled “About” stated, “Dr Bunny Aesthetics Clinics Advanced Aesthetics Practitioners Providing Non-Surgical Aesthetic and Cosmetic Procedures”.",The Joint Council for Cosmetic Practitioners (JCCP) challenged whether: 1. the ad breached the Code because it advertised a prescription-only medicine (POM); and 2. the name “Dr Bunny Aesthetics” was misleading.,"Dr Bunny Aesthetics said they had amended the business name to DBA Clinic and had removed the reference to a prescription-only medicine. Fresha.com SV Ltd t/a Fresha said that individual businesses were responsible for the content of their listings, nonetheless, they offered to remove the advertiser from the platform.","1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that prescription-only medicines (POMs) may not be advertised to the public. The ad was a listing for an aesthetics clinic “Dr Bunny Aesthetics” on the booking platform Fresha, who provided booking services for beauty and wellness providers. We understood that, within the context of an ad for an aesthetic clinic, ‘Botulinum Toxin’ referred to a botulinum toxin type A product and that it was a POM. We considered that the listing contained multiple direct references to a botulinum toxin including “Botulinum Toxin […] from £50” along with a description of the treatment “Anti-ageing treatment is prepared from botulin […] for younger, more fresh looking skin”. We further considered that references to “anti-wrinkle” treatment within the ad were indirect references to Botox, that had the same effect as promoting a POM. Furthermore, we understood that consumers could book and pay for the treatment from the ad directly, without receiving a consultation prior to undergoing the treatment. For those reasons, we considered the listing advertised a POM to the general public and concluded the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 2. Upheld We considered that, within the context of an ad for an aesthetics clinic, consumers would interpret the clinic name “Dr Bunny Aesthetics” to mean that the clinic was owned and operated by someone who held a general medical qualification. We considered that, alongside the repeated use of the prefix ""Dr"", reference to “Advanced Aesthetics Practitioners” furthered that impression. We did not receive any evidence to substantiate that the clinic was owned or operated by someone who held a general medical qualification and therefore concluded the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.9 (Qualifications)","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Dr Bunny Aesthetics not to advertise prescription-only medicines to the public in future and not to claim or imply the clinic was owned or operated by a person who held a general medical qualification, for example by the use of ‘Dr’, when that was not the case.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/dr-bunny-aesthetics-a23-1218983-dr-bunny-aesthetics.html
"ASA Ruling on GKOnlineCo Pty Ltd t/a Pups Den, Official Aida Store","This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on ads making claims about the treatment of symptoms of the menopause. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Facebook ad for Aida Wellbeing, seen on 18 January 2024, featured the text “Revealing I relieved my meno-bloat in 48 hours… 3 steps for the same results with the VolcanicX bundle: 1. Add 2-3 drops of peppermint essential oil to your VolcanicX bracelet 2. Adjust the VolcanicX bracelet to fit you snug 3. Wear it 24/7 for fast bloating relief & appetite control”, followed by “This bundle includes your VolcanicX Bracelet & Peppermint Premium Scented Oil”. An image of the VolcanicX bracelet and peppermint oil featured the text “MENO-BELLY SOLUTION WHATS THE SECRET? MADE FOR WOMEN. IF YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEAN”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it made medicinal or medical claims for an unlicenced product.,"GKOnlineCo Pty Ltd t/a Official Aida Store said that they would cease promoting the product and review their advertising. They stated that the product was certified as a medical device, but did not provide the relevant certifications. They further said they would investigate the need for, and if applicable, provide Marketing Authorisation documentation from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that medicinal or medical claims may be made for a medicinal product that was licenced by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the appropriate conformity marking. In addition, the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 required that a medical device should be registered with the MHRA before it was placed on the market in Great Britain. A medicinal product was a substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings. Medical devices included articles, whether used alone or in combination, which were intended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purposes of diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease. The ASA considered that consumers would interpret the claims “relieving meno-bloat in 48 hours” and “fast bloating relief and appetite control” to mean that the VolcanicX bracelet and the peppermint oil supplied with it could in combination treat those symptoms of the menopause. Whilst the menopause itself was not a medical condition, claims regarding the treatment and management of the adverse symptoms of menopause were medicinal or medical claims. The VolcanicX bracelet was therefore classified as a medical device, and the peppermint oil sold with, and to be applied to, the bracelet was classified as a medicinal product, as the medicinal/medical claims made in the ad were attributed to both. However, we had not seen evidence that the peppermint oil was appropriately licenced as a medicinal product, or that the bracelet was registered with the MHRA and held the appropriate conformity marking. Therefore, no medicinal or medical claims could be made for the products. Because the ad made such claims, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.10 (Legality), 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products) and 12.11 (Medicines).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on infirst Ltd t/a Flarin,,"A TV ad for Flarin, seen on 22 October 2023, featured a voice-over that stated, “For joint paint, no other ibuprofen has been proven to be more effective.” At the same time, the same text appeared on screen alongside an image of Flarin Joint & Muscular Pain Relief packaging. The ad switched to a scene of two people out jogging whilst another voice-over-stated, “I discovered Flarin and I’m just amazed at how much it helped my hip pain.” The first voice-over then stated, “Only Flarin features lipid lock technology, encasing ibuprofen in lipid oils, which are absorbed in the small intestine. So when joint pain flares, choose Flarin.” At the same time, the ad included an animation of the lipid lock technology working as two tablets moved through the stomach into the small intestine, and product shots of Flarin and Flarin Joint & Muscular Pain Relief with on-screen text that stated, “WHEN JOINT PAIN FLARES CHOOSE FLARIN”. Throughout the ad, on-screen text at the bottom of the ad stated, “Flarin Joint & Muscular Pain Relief 200mg soft capsules & Flarin 200mg soft capsules. Contain ibuprofen. Relief from rheumatic or muscular pain, joint pain, back pain […]”.","The complainant who believed the ad implied that Flarin was more, or uniquely, effective for joint pain, challenged whether it was misleading.","infirst Ltd t/a Flarin said that they did not agree that the ad was misleading, as it neither directly nor indirectly implied better efficacy than other ibuprofen products; rather, it was a ‘top parity’ claim. They provided evidence to support that Flarin was just as good, but not better than, any other ibuprofen on the market for treating joint pain. They did not agree that a competitor was identifiable in the ad, as the comparison was with an active ingredient, which was present in multiple branded and unbranded products. They had updated their advertising following an ASA ruling in 2020 regarding a TV ad for Flarin, which the ASA concluded had implied that Flarin was superior to other ibuprofen products for treating joint pain. They had paid attention to both the BCAP Code and the previous ruling when developing the new ad, which was approved without amendment by both Clearcast and the Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB). The new ad did not use the claim “Flarin is different”, and the information about the product was presented in a different order than in the previous ad. They believed the new version of the ad would be understood to mean that Flarin was as effective as other ibuprofen products, but that it was unique due to its lipid formulation, referred to in the ad as “Lipid Lock” technology. That was a trademark, which was a brand device to explain how the Flarin product was formulated. However, it did not describe how the product worked, and there was no link to efficacy. They considered that the ad contained two distinct claims, firstly, the ‘top parity’ claim, and secondly the factual claim that only Flarin featured Lipid Lock technology. Both of those claims were separately substantiated. They highlighted that the voice-over claim “Only Flarin ibuprofen has Lipid Lock Technology” was accompanied by on-screen text stating “LIPID LOCK” and a pack shot showing the claim “LIPID FORMULATION” on-pack. This was followed by a factual description, including an illustrating animation, of how the product was absorbed in the body. It was clearly separated from the top parity efficacy claim because there was a testimonial, accompanied by footage of a man and woman running, in between the two statements. They said the animated typographic style of the accented statements at the beginning of the ad was widely used in advertising, particularly in shorter TV ads, to deliver a message more prominently. The full text had appeared on screen for the legally required ‘hold time’ for consumers to be able to read and comprehend all the words appearing on screen at a given time. The use of the testimonial allowed consumers to hear the genuine experience of using Flarin from a satisfied customer who believed that brand had delivered joint pain relief from them. It was presented in the manner of an ‘ad within an ad’ and was clearly separate from the other claims. They said that other pain relief brands used terms such as “targets the source of pain” or “lasts up to eight hours” to help consumers understand their differences. Regarding the endline “So, when joint pain flares, choose Flarin”, they said that the call to action only requested the consumers to consider trying the product as a conclusion from the ad as a whole, rather than a specific part of it. Clearcast stated that they took care to ensure the ad did not imply that Flarin was more effective than any other ibuprofen on the market, but they understood it was acceptable to say that the product was just as effective as other ibuprofen products. They had taken into consideration the previous ruling, and considered that the claim “For joint pain, no other ibuprofen has been proven to be more effective” was acceptable as a top parity claim. They believed that it did not claim that Flarin was more effective, or superior. The claim had appeared in Flarin’s TV ads since the ASA’s 2020 ruling. They considered that within the overall context of the ad, there was no implication that Flarin was better than other products, through difference or uniqueness. The presentation of the claims was set out as a top parity efficacy claim, followed by a user testimonial, and then an outline of its formulation. They did not believe that the claim “Only Flarin features lipid lock technology, encasing ibuprofen in lipid oils, which are absorbed in the small intestine” implied the product was better. There was no indication that the formulation differentiated the product as a more effective ibuprofen because the testimonial created a gap between the two claims. The Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB), a trade association of which infirst Ltd was a member, said the ad was reviewed and approved by PAGB in August 2023. As part of that process, they considered the ASA’s 2020 ruling. The previously investigated claim “Flarin is different” did not feature in this ad. Instead, the top parity claim “For joint pain, no other ibuprofen has been proven to be more effective” was used as a standalone claim, followed by a testimonial which reflected the product’s function. The next scene highlighted Flarin’s lipid lock technology. While it correctly stated that Flarin was the only product to feature the technology, it did not connect this to efficacy. Rather, it highlighted that the defining feature of the technology was that it encased ibuprofen in lipid oils, which were absorbed in the small intestine. All featured claims were fully substantiated by evidence supplied to PAGB and Clearcast. PAGB also considered that when comparisons of medicines were made with an active ingredient rather than a branded product, the ASA was unlikely to consider that the comparison was being made with identifiable competitors. Based on their experience, they believed that consumers would understand the claims the way they were intended, and not as implying that Flarin was more, or uniquely, effective for joint pain relief than other forms of ibuprofen.","Upheld The ASA understood that the ad was for an ibuprofen product and was intended to make two distinct claims. Firstly, that Flarin was just as effective for joint pain, but not more effective than, other ibuprofen products on the market (a ‘top parity’ claim). Secondly, that only Flarin featured Lipid Lock technology, which encased ibuprofen in lipid oils, and was absorbed in the small intestine. We understood that both of those claims were substantiated. Our investigation was instead concerned specifically with whether those claims as presented in the ad, as well as the overall impression created by the ad, would be understood to mean that because of Flarin’s Lipid Lock technology, Flarin was more, or uniquely, effective for joint pain, which was not the case. We therefore assessed how the ad was likely to be interpreted by consumers. The voice-over in the ad stated, “For joint pain, no other ibuprofen has been proven to be more effective.” The claim also appeared in on-screen text, with the phrases “joint pain” and “more effective” in red print, with the remaining text contrasted in blue. As the claim was spoken, the statements “joint pain” and “more effective” were enlarged and animated. We considered that the claim in the voice-over could in isolation be understood to mean that Flarin was just as good, but not better than, any other ibuprofen on the market for treating joint pain. We further acknowledged that the on-screen claim appeared for the required ‘hold time’ for consumers to be able to read and comprehend the text. We considered, however, that the visual emphasis placed on the words “joint pain” and “more effective” both in colouring and animation introduced ambiguity to the way in which consumers would interpret the claim. The accented statements, “joint pain” and “more effective”, presented in rapid succession, would be understood by consumers to mean that Flarin was specifically more effective for joint pain than other ibuprofen products. The claim was then followed by a testimonial which supported Flarin’s efficacy for treating hip joint pain, which added to that impression. The second claim then stated, “Only Flarin features Lipid Lock technology, encasing ibuprofen in lipid oils, which are absorbed in the small intestine”. We acknowledged that the claim relating to the Lipid Lock technology was a factual claim. We also understood that the Lipid Lock technology did not affect Flarin’s efficacy, and instead referred to the product’s formulation. However, the claim was succeeded by a voice-over that concluded, “So when joint pain flares, choose Flarin”. Because this conclusion was presented after the claim “Only Flarin features Lipid Lock technology […]”, and the top parity claim, which placed visual emphasis on the words “joint pain” and “more effective”, we considered that consumers would understand that the Lipid Lock technology was linked to the product’s efficacy. For the above reasons, we considered that the ad implied that Flarin, due to its Lipid Lock technology, was more, or uniquely, effective for relieving joint pain, compared to other ibuprofen products. Because we considered that the ad implied that Flarin was superior to other ibuprofen products for treating joint pain, we concluded that the ad was misleading and breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation) and 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told infirst Ltd t/a Flarin to ensure they did not imply that Flarin was more, or uniquely, effective for joint pain relief than other forms of ibuprofen.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/infirst-ltd-a23-1217846-infirst-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Hismile Pty Ltd,,"Two paid-for TikTok ads for Hismile, a toothpaste and teeth whitening company, seen on 14 November 2023: a. The first ad showed a person who picked up a tube of Ben and Jerry’s Cookie Dough flavoured and branded toothpaste in the toothpaste aisle of a shop, from a selection of other Hismile toothpaste flavours. The toothpaste was then shown being mixed in a laboratory dish and applied to a toothbrush. The video also showed a person standing in front of a table with a line of Hismile toothpastes on it. Behind the line was a bottle of Flying Goose hot sauce and Lotus Biscoff spread and biscuits. The camera moved along the line and the person stated, ""… these come in all these mouthwatering tasty flavours …"" The video’s caption stated “Cookie dough flavoured toothpaste?! [...] #cookiedough #benandjerrys [...]"". b. The second ad featured a person walking through a warehouse, on-screen text of a TikTok comment stated, “Sorry I have a boyfriend, don't send me the cookie dough mystery flavour”. A voice-over read the comment and said, “Are you serious? We don't even have this flavour yet, and it's not one of the mystery flavours we sneak into orders.” A box of different flavoured toothpastes was shown that included the logos and branding of Sour Patch Kids sweets, Lotus Biscoff spread, Red Bull energy drink, Starbucks Pumpkin Spice coffee and Ben and Jerry's Cookie Dough ice-cream. The video’s caption stated, “Did someone say MYSTERY FLAVOUR? […]”.",The complainant challenged whether the ads were misleading because they understood not all of the branded flavours of toothpaste shown were produced and sold by Hismile.,"Hismile Pty Ltd said ad (a) showed the Hismile Research and Development Centre, and that the depiction of the Cookie Dough flavour, and the other unreleased flavours, highlighted their ongoing innovation and development. They said the ad was not misleading because it showed available flavours in its discussion of the Hismile bundle offer. Ad (b) stated that mystery flavours would be included in some orders in the bundle offer. Hismile said the Ben and Jerry’s Cookie Dough, Sour Patch Kids, Lotus Biscoff, Red Bull and Starbucks Pumpkin Spice coffee flavoured toothpaste were unreleased and were unavailable. They said the ad’s discussion of the bundle offer reinforced that those flavours were unavailable, as when the bundle was shown being packaged, the camera moved across the range of available flavours and the actor said, “… and you can get any one of these toothpaste flavours for less than a dollar in the bundle.” They said the phrasing used in the ad and the removal of the unreleased flavours from the camera frame meant the overall impression of the ad was not misleading. Hismile said that when showing ‘in development’ flavours not yet ready for purchase, their intention was not to mislead but rather to demonstrate their innovation and creative process. By presenting those flavours they sought to engage with their audience, to receive feedback on preferences and to enhance the overall consumer experience.","Upheld The ads showed a number of different toothpaste tubes that used the names, flavours and logos of well-known brands. The ASA acknowledged that ad (a) stated the Ben and Jerry’s Cookie Dough ice-cream flavour featured was not available. However, while the ad showed a toothpaste being mixed in a laboratory, the other tubes shown in both ads appeared to be finished products, and were similar in shape and size to the other non-branded generic Hismile toothpastes featured. Ad (a) also showed a line of Hismile toothpastes in front of a bottle of Flying Goose hot sauce and Lotus Biscoff spread and biscuits, with the caption “Cookie dough flavoured toothpaste?! [...] #cookiedough #benandjerrys”, which we considered gave the impression those flavours were available for purchase by consumers. Additionally, ad (b) showed a box that contained predominately branded toothpastes while a voice-over discussed the “mystery flavours” included in orders, which we considered gave the impression those flavours could be added to orders. We considered consumers would interpret the ads as meaning that Hismile produced the branded toothpastes shown and offered them for sale. We understood that, at the time of the complaint, Hismile did not produce the branded toothpastes shown, and that they were not available for consumers to purchase. We therefore concluded the ads were likely to mislead. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 3.11 (Exaggeration).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained off.

ASA Ruling on John Mills Ltd t/a JML Direct,,"A TV ad for JML DriBUDDi, a heated drying pod, seen in November 2023. The ad featured a testimonial from a customer who stated, “Because I live in a small flat, I used to hang my clothes on the radiator or clotheshorse. I used to find condensation and the smell of damp clothes all the time. Now I put things in the DriBUDDi, it’s just gone”. The ad showed various clothes and a towel sitting on a radiator with condensation appearing on the window above, followed by a close-up image of water droplets on a window.",The complainant challenged whether the testimonial misleadingly implied that using the product prevented condensation from forming.,"John Mills Ltd t/a JML said that the relevant claim formed part of a testimonial and was therefore the personal opinion of the user. They believed viewers would interpret the claim within that context and understand that it was intended to compare the user experience of the DriBUDDi with that of drying clothes on a radiator inside. JML provided results from two in-house tests. In the first test, they used the DriBUDDi to dry nine garments, weighing 1.74 kg dry and 2.66 kg after washing, over the space of two hours. The then followed up with a second test, which tested 18 garments weighing 3.82 kg dry and 5.42 kg after washing. They supplied videos of each test which demonstrated test conditions. They observed that throughout both tests, condensation had not formed on the window next to where the DriBUDDi stood. They said that proved the claim in the testimonial was accurate and not misleading. They explained that excess moisture in the air led to condensation which could form on walls, windows and other surfaces, but because the DriBUDDi was an enclosed space, moisture was kept inside the fabric cover. Clearcast said that they had been clearing ads for the JML DriBUDDi for over 10 years and believed the way the product worked was widely understood by audiences. Hot air circulated within the ‘cocoon’ covering of the DriBUDDi to allow for a speedier drying time and to prevent moisture from escaping onto windows and walls. They referred to two articles which highlighted the benefits of using heated drying pods, and that research conducted by the University of Manchester found that drying clothes on radiators raised moisture levels in the home by up to 30%. They also said that, while the original data to support the claim was not easily accessible, the advertiser had provided results of two tests which substantiated the claim in question. Clearcast also supplied forms that were signed by the individuals who they said had given testimonials in the ad, confirming that the views expressed were true and genuine. Clearcast acknowledged that testimonials alone were not adequate substantiation for an objective claim; however, they believed that the forms nonetheless supported that the claims were accurate to the users’ experience.","Upheld The ASA understood that the DriBUDDi was a drying pod used to dry laundry indoors. The fabric zip-on cover created an enclosed space in which heated air circulated and featured small holes at the top of the cover to allow air flow. We noted that the testimonial was given by a man who compared his experience of drying clothes on the radiator in a small flat with using the DriBUDDi. When he used the DriBUDDi, he noted that the smell of damp and condensation was “just gone”. During his testimonial, the ad showed several items drying on a radiator with condensation on the window above, followed by a zoomed-in shot of condensation on a window. Whilst we acknowledged that the claim appeared clearly within a testimonial, we considered that viewers would interpret it as a claim about the product’s efficacy which was capable of objective substantiation, rather than a subjective claim based solely on personal experience. We therefore considered viewers would understand that the DriBUDDi, itself, was able to prevent the smell of damp and condensation produced by drying clothes inside, particularly in a small household space. We firstly assessed the evidence provided by Clearcast. We examined the first article which they considered substantiated the claims in the ad. We noted that it originated from a science magazine; it outlined the physical process underpinning the drying of clothes and discussed the different methods of drying clothes indoors. The article commented only on the speed and running cost of drying pods in comparison to other heated airers. It did not examine the amount of condensation produced by drying pods, and consequently, we considered that the article was not relevant to the efficacy claim in the ad. The second article was a consumer magazine review of the best and cheapest methods of drying clothes indoors. It assessed the benefits and disadvantages of drying pods in terms of their capacity, price and speed. While the article identified that other drying methods either fought or brought risk of damp, the article was silent on how a drying pod affected dampness. However, because neither article evidenced that drying pods prevented condensation from forming, we considered that they were not relevant to the claims made in the ad and did not demonstrate the efficacy of the product. We then assessed the testimonial documents supplied by Clearcast, which were signed by the speakers in the ad. We acknowledged that evidence showed the testimonials were genuine. However, we considered that personal or customer endorsement alone did not substantiate the efficacy claim as consumers would understand it. We therefore expected JML to hold objective substantiation that demonstrated the product prevented condensation from forming when used as advertised. We next examined the in-house test reports. We noted that the first test used nine garments, with a dry weight of 1.74 kg and a washed weight of 2.66 kg. The garments were weighed again at the end of the test to verify that they had dried completely. In order to test the efficacy of the DriBUDDi’s ability to prevent condensation forming, the humidity of the room was measured before and after the garments had dried. We noted that before drying, the humidity of the room was 53%, and after, it had dropped to 50%. The test also relied on physical observation of the environment to monitor whether condensation formed on the window while the DriBUDDi was in use. From the video footage of the first test, we noted that condensation was not visible on the window or any of the surfaces in the room during or after the test. While the test results suggested that humidity decreased during the test, we considered that did not necessarily indicate there was less moisture in the air. We understood the humidity measurement provided by JML was ‘relative humidity’, which measured, as a percentage, the amount of moisture present in the air relative to the amount that would be present if the air was saturated. We understood that warm air could hold more moisture than cold air, and therefore, increasing the temperature of the air while keeping the moisture level constant would decrease the relative humidity, as the air had greater capacity to hold moisture. With that in mind, we understood that as the DriBUDDi heated the room, the air temperature increased, causing the relative humidity of the room to decrease. However, we understood that did not mean the DriBUDDi reduced the level of moisture in the air, rather that the air was now warmer and able to hold more moisture before reaching saturation. For that reason, we did not consider the results sufficiently evidenced that the DriBUDDi prevented condensation. Furthermore, we noted that this test was performed with considerably less laundry than the advertised capacity of the DriBUDDi. While the ad stated that the DriBUDDi could hold up to 18 garments or 10 kg of washing, the test was performed using only nine garments that weighed 2.66 kg. We understood that the volume of laundry would significantly affect the level of moisture present in the DriBUDDi and within the test environment. Because the test had not been conducted with 10 kg of laundry, and therefore did not demonstrate that the DriBUDDi could be used at its advertised capacity without the formation of condensation, we further considered the test was not sufficient to substantiate the claim. In addition, we considered that the test conditions were not representative of the typical household room in which the DriBUDDi would be used. We noted that the videos of the first test, supplied by JML, showed the DriBUDDi operating in a large room with an internal window facing a warehouse floor. However, we considered that, because the internal window was sheltered from the outside air, it would have a higher surface temperature than if it was an external window, as typical in the average UK home. We understood that condensation formed when water vapour came into contact with cold surfaces, and therefore we considered that the temperature of the window was an important factor in whether condensation formed. We also considered that the size of the room was a significant variable in the test, which neither matched the description of the small flat in the testimonial nor the average household room in which the product would be used. We understood that a larger room afforded more space for the air to circulate, and it was less likely that the air would become saturated with water vapour, causing condensation. Therefore, we considered that, by conducting the test in an environment which did not represent the average UK home, and in conditions that would likely result in less condensation, the study was insufficient to substantiate the claim. JML then repeated the test in a household room with a larger volume of washing. The test used 18 garments, with a dry weight of 3.82 kg and a washed weight of 5.42 kg. Similarly, the test relied on observation of the environment to detect the presence of condensation. We firstly noted that the size of the room was not given by JML, nor apparent from the video. We further noted that the quality of the video was low and as a result, the light coming through the window behind the DriBUDDi obscured the surface of the glass. It was therefore difficult to discern whether condensation had formed. Given that the test relied solely on observation, we concluded the test was not documentary evidence for the claim and was insufficient to prove the claim that the DriBUDDi prevented condensation. We understood that the User Guide for the JML DriBUDDi stated that the product “should only be used in a well-ventilated area. If ventilation is lacking, it can also be used near an open window”. We accepted that ventilation was important to mitigate condensation formed by clothes drying indoors, as it allowed moisture to move from the room. We therefore considered that if the DriBUDDi was used according to the User Guide, in a room sufficiently well-ventilated, the formation of condensation may be prevented. However, we considered that the impression of the ad was that the DriBUDDi itself prevented condensation from forming, rather than environmental factors such as ventilation or presence of an open window. For that reason, we considered that the ad exaggerated the capabilities of the DriBUDDi. Given that the studies provided were insufficient to prove the claim that the DriBUDDi prevented condensation, and the User Guide indicated that the prevention of condensation was due to external factors, we concluded that the claim exaggerated the capabilities of the DriBUDDi and had not been substantiated. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading Advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation), 3.12 (Exaggeration) and 3.45 (Endorsements and testimonials).",The ad must not be broadcast again in the form complained of. We told John Mills Ltd t/a JML to ensure that they did not misleadingly exaggerate the efficacy of the DriBUDDi in the absence of adequate substantiation.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/john-mills-ltd-a23-1221685-john-mills-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Mous Products Ltd,,"A TV ad for Mous, a mobile phone case company, seen on 15 October 2023, featured an individual who said, “50 people … throwing their phones in Mous cases … let’s go.” Several people then threw their mobile phones into the air at the same time, followed by close-ups of the phones mid-air, before they landed on the ground. In the following scene, those individuals looked relieved after checking their phones and finding that they had not been damaged and continued to function as normal.",The complainant challenged whether the ad misleadingly exaggerated the efficacy of Mous phone cases because their phone was damaged after a fall from a short height when fitted with the product.,"Mous Products Ltd t/a Mous said the ad was intended to demonstrate that their phone cases provided enhanced protection against drops and falls. They believed the ad did not exaggerate or make any claims about performance or capability but demonstrated a genuine record of 50 simultaneous drop tests. They highlighted that the ad did not state or imply that their products would prevent all damage from occurring in the event that a phone was dropped, nor did it include a statement about their products providing a particular level of protection. They explained the ad showed a sample of 50 users testing their products in a group challenge, and the ad was an honest and genuine representation of the outcome of that test, with all 50 participants’ phones undamaged. However, they did not believe that a consumer would interpret the ad to mean that a Mous phone case would prevent damage in all circumstances, particularly because they believed it was well known that phones with glass screens were likely to incur damage if dropped. They explained that their testing process was rigorous and demonstrated that the use of their protective cases made phone damage less likely in the event of a fall or drop than an uncased phone. In their internal drop test reports, they said that they assessed the calling functionality, speaker operation, GPS navigation, volume and power button performance, wifi connectivity and correct charging function of a phone, which they believed would identify any internal damage issues. They also said that they had documentary evidence of the phone drops seen in the ad and had carried out thousands of drops tests across ten years in the development of their product. They provided a sample of evidence that consisted of three such drop test reports. Mous acknowledged that there would be circumstances where a drop or fall less extreme than that shown in the ad would cause damage to a phone, despite using the same Mous phone case. They explained that other contributary factors could influence the level of damage sustained, such as the type of surface on the ground, the condition and drop history of the phone prior to using the phone case, and whether the user had correctly secured the phone within the case. They included text on their warranty page and website as part of the purchase process which stated that their phone cases did not make devices indestructible. For clarity, they said that they would be taking steps to amend their ads to include similar text to that seen in their warranty highlighting that, whilst their products were highly protective, they did not make a customer’s device indestructible. They said that if a consumer complained to them directly in relation to damage incurred whilst using one of their phone case products, they would honour their consumer rights and warranty process. Clearcast did not believe the ad implied the case would prevent all damage to a phone; instead, the ad suggested that the case was better able to mitigate damage, and was particularly rugged. They said that anyone who had experience of purchasing a protective case would be aware that all damage could not be prevented entirely owing to existing superficial damage and other environmental factors. As part of the approval process, Clearcast requested evidence from the advertiser demonstrating that the phones had been protected following the drop shown in the ad. They were provided with data relating to the 50 phones used in the ad; it showed that a mixture of different models of varying ages had been used and that they had been dropped onto concrete paving. It also showed that the phones had been assessed after for damage to the screen, camera, button and hardware function, phone casing and also to the protective case itself. They said the test data showed that all phones were fully functional following the filming of the scene. To be certain of their interpretation, they explained that they also took advice from their consultant who agreed that the data was a comprehensive overview of the in-use durability of the cases used in the ad. They said the agency had also provided them with further information regarding the materials and manufacture of the cases and the test protocol each design was subject to prior to launch, as well as reviews from customers that further highlighted that the cases were designed to specifically protect against drops and falls. Given that they had received an assurance that the final ad would show a genuine demonstration sequence that occurred as shot, and they were provided with data evidencing the product’s performance on each of the phones, they were satisfied with the ad.","Upheld The ASA considered that, within the context of the ad, viewers would interpret the footage of several individuals throwing their phones into the air, before collecting them from the ground, and looking relieved upon checking their phones for damage, to mean that the phones had not incurred significant physical or internal damage. We further considered that one of the featured individuals in the ad who said, “I can’t believe it” when assessing his phone, along with the shot of an individual using his phone, after their respective phones had been dropped, also reinforced that impression. Furthermore, because the ad demonstrated an unrealistic scenario of several phones being thrown into the air, we considered the ad implied that, by using a Mous phone case, any phone would be able to sustain more of an impact than a consumer would likely need. We assessed the evidence provided by the advertiser. We first examined the ad and corresponding test result data. We understood that of the 50 participants in the ad, the majority of the cast were comprised of Mous employees, friends and family, apart from three paid actors. We considered that, because of the participants involved and their association with Mous, that the test was not conducted independently and the footage shown in the ad did not represent an objective study of any damage incurred. We acknowledged that the test results referenced external damage to both the screen and rear exterior casing, camera and power/volume buttons, and whether those functions were still usable. However, we noted that the phone had not been disassembled to assess for internal damage, which we considered would affect the functionality of a phone. Because the test did not assess for internal damage we did not consider that the data provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the phones had not been significantly damaged when dropped from being thrown into the air. We then assessed the three drop test reports provided for three different Mous phone cases. The first report contained before and after photos of the case. We noted the testing had not been completed by using a phone and the report only related to damage sustained by the phone case itself. We therefore considered that the report was not relevant in substantiating claims about preventing damage to phones, as seen in the ad. We then examined the second and third reports. The test in both reports comprised of 26 drops onto a surface of marble backed by concrete from a height of 120 cm and both had the same acceptance threshold specifying that the phone should perform correctly with minimum aesthetic damage. Both reports also contained before and after images of the phone cases and phone. We acknowledged that both reports indicated that the phones continued to function after being dropped and that the cases were recorded as having sufficiently ‘passed’ the drop tests. However, we noted that the height of the drop tests was significantly lower than had been shown in the ad, and as such, regardless of any results demonstrating that the cases had prevented damage from occurring, we did not consider the reports were sufficient to substantiate that the cases could protect a phone from falls that were higher than 120cm. Furthermore, we noted that the two reports were inconsistent in terms of the level of detail provided regarding the test criteria and damage sustained to the phone during the test. The second report contained images of the testing process showing each drop starting position, which we considered did not sufficiently demonstrate that the phone continued to function after having been dropped. The third report provided a description of the phone inspection results relating to the physical condition and working functionality of the phone post-test. We acknowledged that the report demonstrated that the phone had been checked for some level of internal damage. However, we considered that certain criteria which would contribute to a phone’s ability to function fully, such as its vibration features, Bluetooth connection, microphone, Face and Touch ID recognition and Near Field Communication (NFC) for mobile payments, had not been tested. We therefore considered that the report was also not sufficient to substantiate that the phone in a Mous phone case continued to function fully after being dropped. Because it was not clear from the reports whether they had adequately tested for all potential internal damage, plus the height from which the phones were dropped were significantly lower than that seen in the ad, we considered they were not sufficient to substantiate that a Mous phone case would protect any phone from more of an impact than a consumer would likely need, as implied by the ad. Therefore, we concluded the ad exaggerated the efficacy of the product and was misleading. The ad breached BCAP rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation) and 3.12 (Exaggeration).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Mous Products Ltd t/a Mous not to exaggerate the efficacy of their products and to ensure they held test data that supported their claims.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/mous-products-ltd-a23-1216884-mous-products-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Nationwide Building Society t/a Nationwide,,"A TV, radio and a press ad for Nationwide seen and heard in October and November 2023: a. The TV ad opened with a shot of a building called “A.N.Y. BANK”. The following scene within an office in the building featured two colleagues in a conversational exchange. The first individual said, “Anyway cutbacks, initial thoughts, downsizing, I could make do with this office here I suppose, but that big space downstairs is? A bit over indulgent nowadays isn’t it?” The other individual then replied, “By downstairs do you mean, closing the actual branch?” The first individual then agreed before the second individual replied, “But Nationwide aren’t.” The first individual then said, “But we’re not Nationwide are we, we’re nothing like them” before he went on to make further comments about their branch and customers whilst on-screen text stated, “Publicly shared branch closures at Lloyds, bank of Scotland/Halifax, Natwest, Barclays, Santander and HSBC”. The exchange was followed by a shot of a Nationwide branch with a voice-over that stated, “Unlike the big banks we’re not closing our branches.” On-screen text stated “Visit Nationwide.co.uk/ourpromise. Valid until 2026.” b. The radio ad featured a conversational exchange between two colleagues. One individual said, “Boss, news from Nationwide” to which the other replied, “Ugh what are they doing now?” The first individual then said, “They’ve just confirmed they’re keeping branches open” and the second individual responded with a laugh before he said, “What nonsense, who needs a branch?” A voice-over then said, “Unlike the big banks we’re not closing our branches. Nationwide, a good way to bank. To view our branch promise search Nationwide.co.uk/ourpromise.” c. The press ad featured text that stated, “Going, Going, Nowhere” below further text which stated, “Unlike the big banks, we’re not closing our branches”. Small print at the bottom of the ad stated “If we have a branch in your town or city, we’ll still be there until at least 2026. Big banks: Lloyds, Bank of Scotland/Halifax, Natwest, Barclays, Santander and HSBC. Source: link.co.uk/initiative/bank-branch-closures”.","282 complainants, including Santander, who understood that Nationwide had recently closed or reduced opening hours at a number of branches, challenged whether the ads were misleading.","Nationwide said they were different from other large financial institutions because they were a mutual society that was owned by their members, all of whom had a mortgage, saving or current account with them. They explained that they were committed to maintaining their branch network, and that was different to their competitors. They also highlighted that their intended target audience for the ad had been their existing current and savings account holders. They said they had previously launched a Branch Promise in 2019 not to leave a town or city where there wasn’t another Nationwide branch in place and said that they had strengthened that Branch Promise in 2023. The 2023 Branch Promise, to which the claims related, guaranteed Nationwide would not close any of their branches until at least 2026. They highlighted the new promise in which they committed to not close any branch, irrespective of location, until at least 2026. They said at the time the ad was seen the Branch Promise information on their website had not been updated to reflect their new 2023 promise. In relation to the claims in the ads, they explained that they had used the present tense, rather than the past tense, to indicate that their Branch Promise referred to future branch closures and believed that consumers would interpret the claims as future facing. They clarified that the Branch Promise specifically committed them to not close branches anywhere until 2026, unless it was outside of their control; for example, a landlord’s termination of their lease or redevelopment of a branch site. They acknowledged that, had their advertising appeared immediately after a significant number of closures, that the ads may have been misleading by omission. However, they clarified that their most recent branch closure had been in April 2023, approximately six months before the ad campaign started, and therefore did not believe the claims were misleading. They said that banks, having carried out a large-scale programme of branch closures over the past ten years, this was also relevant information in the context of consumers’ likely interpretation of the ad. They provided two tables showing the number of bank branch closures and the percentage of branch estates closed over a ten-year period from 2013 to 2023. They said that of the ten banks listed in the tables, Nationwide had the largest remaining number of branches and had closed the smallest percentage of its estate. Furthermore, they supplied a full list of branches that had been closed in the previous 18 months, which detailed that they had closed 20 branches in the last 18 months, with two closed in 2023. They explained that those closures fell within the exclusions listed in their previous 2019 Branch Promise. In addition, they provided data that showed publicly announced future bank closures including those planned by Barclays, Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and Natwest. They said that, of the UK’s 10 major financial institutions, they were the only one to commit to not close branches between now and 2026. They also supplied an article from consumer magazine Which?, that recommended Nationwide as a building society for consumers who still valued face-to-face contact. They considered that bank branch closures were felt most by vulnerable customers and highlighted that Nationwide was now the last branch in 85 towns in Britain. As an alternative to closing branches, Nationwide said they had trialled reduced opening hours in 88 branches, which they had converted to Multi-Skilled Branches (MSBs). They believed that, for vulnerable customers, it was vital to keep branches open and that customers would rather adapt to revised opening hours than a branch closure. They supplied research which demonstrated that the impact of converting branches to MSBs was minimal. The MSB branches were fully operational three or four days a week depending on the number of days they had previously been open and on branch closure days, their staff worked in central customer contact roles. In any case, they asserted that the claims in the ads were specifically about branch closures and were not promises to maintain branch opening hours. They explained that the Financial Conduct Authority distinguished between reductions in hours that might have a significant impact on their customers’ ability to access branch services as opposed to reductions that had a less significant impact, and they said their research showed that MSBs did not have a significant impact on their customers. Therefore, they did not consider that reduced opening hours were an omission from their advertising that could be considered misleading. Clearcast said they had discussed the claims and substantiation provided by Nationwide thoroughly. Nationwide provided them with substation that showed comparative data related to the closure of branches from relevant banks. According to that data, Nationwide had the highest number of physical branches that would remain open. They also received an assurance from Nationwide that supported their 2023 ‘Branch Promise’. They believed that, even though Nationwide had closed branches in the past, that did not invalidate their current intention. They highlighted that the ad contained superimposed text that qualified which banks were included in the comparison and signposted viewers to Nationwide’s website where details of the Branch Promise were provided. Therefore, along with Nationwide’s assurance of no further closures, they were confident that the claims made were accurate, supported and appropriately qualified. Radiocentre said they had seen the advertiser’s response and fully endorsed the points made. They said prior to broadcast of the ad, they had reviewed the evidence and were satisfied the content of the radio ads would not mislead.","Upheld The ads were seen in the context of financial institutions closing their high street branches, and the ASA considered consumers would interpret the ads in relation to that scenario. We considered that ad (a), the TV ad, satirised the decision-making process taken by banks in relation to closing their branches, and contrasted that with Nationwide’s approach, through the portrayal of a senior manager at an unknown bank showing indifference to the effect on customers of branches closing. We considered that the line “But we’re not Nationwide are we, we’re nothing like them” alongside the statement “Unlike the big banks we’re not closing our branches” was likely to be seen by viewers as suggesting that Nationwide had taken a decision to keep their branches open because of an understanding of the benefits for customers. Ad (b), the radio ad, featured a similar exchange between the senior manager and his assistant, and included the line “Unlike the big banks we’re not closing our branches. Nationwide, a good way to bank”. We considered listeners were also likely to understand from that ad that Nationwide had made a decision to keep their branches open. Ad (c), the press ad, contained large headline text stating “Going, going nowhere” and again stated “Unlike the big banks, we’re not closing our branches”. We considered consumers would understand the ad to be giving the same suggestion about branches remaining open as ads (a) and (b). We considered that switching accounts was something that consumers were unlikely to do regularly, and when choosing a bank or building society, consumers were likely to understand claims about decisions not to close branches to relate to the long-term. Whilst we acknowledged that Nationwide’s intended target audience of the ad were their existing account holders, we considered that both consumers who were currently with Nationwide and those who were not would be interested in the claims made in the ads. Ads (a) and (c) included qualifications that referred to the fact that the ‘Branch Promise’ would be in place until at least 2026, with both ads including references to Santander as a comparative ‘Big bank’. Whilst the qualifications in ads (a) and (c) included the date from which Nationwide could commence closing branches, we considered that they were likely to be missed because of the way they had been presented. We also understood that in the 12 months prior to the ad campaign, Santander had closed fewer branches than Nationwide and at the time the ad was seen Santander had not announced that they would be closing branches in the future, based on the information presented on the webpages linked to in the ads. Therefore, whilst we considered the qualifications would be likely to be missed, for consumers who had seen them, the qualifications would be likely to mislead consumers specifically in relation to the comparison with Santander. Ad (b) included no such qualification and therefore it would not be clear from that ad that the Branch Promise was valid until 2026. Had the timeframe been made clearer in the ads, we considered that would likely have overridden the impression that the Branch Promise related to the longer term. We acknowledged that over a ten-year period, in comparison to other financial institutions, Nationwide had closed the smallest percentage of any financial institution’s estate. However, we noted that they had nevertheless closed 20% of their estate, which equated to 152 branches, and we considered that was a significant number that had been permanently closed. We also understood that since Nationwide had launched their original Branch Promise, in the 18 months since July 2022, they had permanently closed 20 branches. Of those 20, 14 had been closed in the 12 months preceding the campaign, with two of them having been closed in 2023. As above, we understood that Nationwide’s Branch Promise was only valid until 2026, at which time Nationwide could begin to close branches permanently. We considered those factors relating to previous, recent branch closures and the effect on future branches in the long term were likely to be significant to consumers when making decisions about whether to choose Nationwide, in the context of the claims made in the ads that Nationwide were not closing their branches. Because we considered that consumers would understand from the ads that Nationwide would not be closing branches in the long-term future and that they had not recently closed branches, we concluded that the ads were misleading. Ads (a) and (b) breached BCAP Code rules 3.1, 3.2 (Misleading advertising) 3.9 (Substantiation) and 3.10 (Qualification). Ad (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising) 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.9 (Qualification).",The ad must not appear again in their current form.

ASA Ruling on Not Guilty Food Co Ltd t/a The Skinny Food Co,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","An Instagram reel for The Skinny Food Co, posted on Katie Price’s account on 20 August 2023. It featured Ms Price making meals for herself throughout the day and talking about her efforts to lose weight. Ms Price was heard in the voice-over saying, “Morning everyone. So here I am making my delicious coffee, with the caramelised biscuit Skinny Food zero calorie syrup. It’s fat free and sugar free too. And on top of that I absolutely love my Skinny Food porridge and guess what, it only has 262 calories. 14 grams of protein, and trust me so yummy …” She then made lunch for herself, saying, “So I am going to have a quick lunch today with the Skinny Food high protein wraps. You won’t believe how good they are. They are also low in sugar, high in fibre, perfect lunch … But what’s best is that garlic mayo sauce on top. They come in so many different flavours. And guess what! Yup, zero calories too …” Ms Price then made her dinner and said, “Here I am, God look at that double chin, here’s why I’m on the Skinny Foods, Jesus, look at that double chin. Now, everyone knows I love a curry, so tonight, I am making a chicken tikka takeaway meal … The curry is low in sugar, high protein and only 189 calories …” The video ended with Katie Price having a post-dinner snack, saying, “Tonight I am having the Skinny Food chocoholic malt balls. They’re only 89 calories per packet, low in sugar, and these really do hit the spot.” The final shot said, “Total calories for the day = 755.” The caption stated, “Another example of how you can eat so many delicious meals and snacks in the day. All of this was only 755 calories and helping me stay in a calorie deficit to shift some extra pounds when needed […] If I have a bad day I like to go in a calorie deficit to ensure it’s not a bad week!

The ASA challenged whether the weight loss claims for the products shown in the ad were authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB NHC Register).","1. Not Guilty Food Co Ltd t/a The Skinny Food Co said that the reel included “#ad”, which they considered was sufficient to ensure that it was visible and clear that the reel was a paid promotion. 2. & 3. On these points, they said they could not control what Ms Price ate. They considered that the ad did not include any health claims, but the post itself talked about being in a caloric deficit, which was a proven way to achieve weight loss. 1., 2. & 3. Ms Price agreed to remove the ad. She confirmed that she followed a calorie deficit approach, which she believed many people in the UK did, and asked for further information on how to make similar posts compliant in future.","1. Upheld The CAP Code states that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. The CAP “Influencers' guide to making clear that ads are ads” further states that any label needs to be clear and prominent upfront. The ASA understood that the Instagram reel was posted as part of a paid collaboration between Ms Price and The Skinny Food Co and was therefore an ad. It featured Ms Price consuming various meals from The Skinny Food Co throughout the day, talking about their nutritional content, and her efforts to lose weight. We considered that consumers would interpret the reel as Ms Price documenting her experience with weight loss and sharing meal ideas with her audience. We acknowledged that the reel featured the hashtag “#ad” in the caption. However, the identifier was placed at the end of the caption and was not visible without engaging with the post and expanding the text. We therefore concluded that the label was insufficiently prominent to obviously identify the ad as a marketing communication from the outset. On this point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.4 (Recognition of marketing communications). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that ads must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. It further stated that ads promoting diets that fell below 800 kilo-calories must do so only for short-term use and must encourage users to take medical advice before embarking on them. The ad featured Ms Price consuming various food products throughout the day, which amounted to 755 kilocalories (kcal) in total. Because all the foods shown in the ad were part of The Skinny Food Co range, we considered that the ad recommended a diet based on those products. As such, it promoted a diet that fell below 800 kilo-calories a day. We therefore assessed whether it complied with the above rules.In the caption of the reel Ms Price stated, “[…] All of this was only 755 calories and helping me stay in a calorie deficit to shift some extra pounds when needed […] If I have a bad day I like to go in a calorie deficit to ensure it’s not a bad week! […]”. While the ad did not detail the specific time limits of Ms Price’s diet, we considered that consumers would understand from the caption that Ms Price followed this diet for a relatively short-term period, to counteract days where she had exceeded her calorie consumption target. However, there was no explicit instruction that the diet must only be followed on a short-term basis, and no reference, either within the video or the caption, to the need to take medical advice before embarking on this diet. We therefore considered that consumers would understand from the ad that they could elect to follow a similar diet that fell below 800 kcal a day by consuming the same products, and other products from The Skinny Food Co’s range, without taking medical advice, until they achieved their desired weight. For the above reasons, we concluded that the ad irresponsibly promoted a diet that fell below 800 kcal a day and was in breach of the Code. On this point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising) and 13.7 (Weight control and slimming). 3. Upheld The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the GB NHC Register were permitted in marketing communications for foods, and that such claims must be supported by documentary evidence to show that the foods met the conditions of use associated with the relevant authorised claim. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food, drink or ingredient and health. Claims that a food product could cause weight loss, or help to maintain weight after weight loss, were health claims for the purposes of the Code. Within the video, Ms Price emphasised the low calorific content of the products while making statements about using them to achieve a calorie deficit, and commented that she was consuming the foods because she had a double chin. The caption also stated, “755 calories and helping me stay in a calorie deficit to shift some extra pounds when needed”. We considered that the above claims, in addition to the overall impression of the ad, implied that the products shown could contribute to weight loss. We additionally considered that in the context of the ad’s focus on the featured foods contributing to weight loss, the references to the food products as “Skinny Food(s)” would be understood by consumers as also being linked to weight loss, or helping to maintain weight after weight loss, and that consuming products from The Skinny Food Co would therefore have those effects. The claim “Skinny Food(s)”, in the context of the ad, was therefore also a health claim for the purposes of the CAP Code. The products in the range would therefore need to contain a substance or substances that would produce the physiological effect of weight loss or maintenance, for which there was an authorised health claim relating to weight loss or maintenance, and for which the product met the relevant conditions of use. However, we had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that was the case. Because the ad made specific health claims that were not authorised on the GB NHC Register, we concluded that it breached the Code. On this point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Not Guilty Food Co Ltd t/a The Skinny Food Co and Katie Price to ensure that their future ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications, and the commercial intent was made clear, and that identifiers such as “#ad” were clearly and prominently displayed. We also told them to ensure that their ads did not irresponsibly promote diets that fell below 800 kcal a day, and to only make weight loss or weight maintenance claims for foods if the claim was authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register and the foods met the associated conditions of use.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/not-guilty-food-co-ltd-g23-1215538-not-guilty-food-co-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Sparks Information PTE Ltd t/a Hunting Sniper,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Hunting Sniper, a mobile app game, seen in January 2024, featured a video compilation of gameplay from the perspective of a first-person view through a sniper scope. The video showed two wild dogs shot and wounded, and a fox shot dead.","Eight complainants, who believed the ad showed real footage of harm to animals, challenged whether the ad was offensive and caused distress without justifiable reason.","Sparks Information PTE Ltd t/a Hunting Sniper explained that their advertising complied with local laws and regulations and did not violate animal protection law. They said that their ads also complied with the advertising policies of the platforms on which they were hosted. They said their ads passed the audits of the advertising platforms and did not violate the policies of these platforms.Hunting Sniper clarified that the ads used virtual footage from the game to show the gameplay experience, not real animals or real hunting scenes. They said they purposely avoided showing direct bullet hits and bloodshed images, and did their best to avoid showing the pain of animals. They said they had since made changes to the investigated ad and subsequent ads to include a statement which explained that the video was fictional gameplay footage and that no real animals were injured or killed.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that ads must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence, and must not cause fear or distress without justifiable reason. The ad showed three animals being hunted from a first-person view through a scope. The ASA considered the black border of the scope directed the viewer’s focus to the targeted animals, two of which were shown in visible distress after they were wounded by the gun shot and one was shown killed instantly. The animals’ cries, echoing gunshots, and the sound of the gun reloading were audible over the background music, which we considered emphasised the distress of the animals. We acknowledged the advertiser’s comment that the ad had been amended to contain a statement that the footage was fictional and no animals were harmed. However, we noted there was no such statement in the ad. Furthermore, we considered that, regardless of whether the video content was fictional, the depiction of the hunted animals would likely be interpreted as realistic imagery, if not real, by viewers, and given the nature of the content, we considered the ad was likely to cause distress. We further acknowledged that whilst the content was relevant to the product, we considered that any distress caused to viewers was not justified for an ad promoting a mobile app game. We therefore considered that the realistic portrayal of hunted animals, which highlighted their suffering, was likely to cause widespread offence to viewers. We concluded that the ad was likely to cause widespread offence and unjustified distress to viewers. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 4.1 and 4.2 (Harm and Offence).",The ad must not appear in its current form. We told Sparks Information PTE Ltd t/a Hunting Sniper to ensure their future ads did not cause offence or distress to consumers by highlighting the suffering of animals.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/sparks-information-pte-ltd-g24-1229784-sparks-information-pte-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Top Games Inc,,"A paid-for X (formerly Twitter) ad for the game Evony: The King’s Return, seen on 24 September 2023, featured a video of a fighter character shooting different barrels. Each barrel had a different number on it. Roman centurions stood on top of some of the barrels. The caption stated “Navigate obstacles, unleash devastating attacks”.","The complainant, who understood that the gameplay depicted in the ad was not representative of the actual game, challenged whether the ad was misleading.","Top Games Inc t/a Evony: The King’s Return said that they did not believe that there had been any breach of the CAP Code. “Evony: The King’s Return” was a free to download and play mobile game available on iOS and Android game and did not have interstitial ads within it. Players could, if they wanted to, purchase virtual digital enhancements. However, all gameplay was accomplished by the player themselves. To progress through the game, players needed to engage in strategic city-building, tactical player versus player and player versus environment on the world map, and progress through puzzles. The main quest line guided players through the games, which required them to focus on each part of the overall game and rewarded them with more content. “Evony: The King’s Return” offered a varied gaming experience with different elements to the game. The ad in question, which featured a fighter character interacting with numerically marked barrels, was indicative of the game’s puzzle solving aspect which was just as essential as the city-building and strategy to progress in the game. While players were not forced to play any specific part of the game, they would fall behind and not progress without playing all parts. The success of the game was based on the fact that it offered wide ranging freedom to engage with the specific parts of the game that players enjoyed. They said that the ad showcased actual gameplay and mechanics, directly engaging the player in strategic thinking and action. They considered that this was different from previous ASA rulings on misleading gaming ads where there was a mismatch between the ad and the gameplay. The ad represented the interactive and strategic components that players actually experienced in the game across the puzzles. The puzzles were not mere mini-games, and they were designed to be challenging and rewarding, blending with the game’s overall strategy. They provided an electronic copy of the ad and two gameplay videos, to showcase the similarities between them. They considered that players were sophisticated enough to determine quickly if a game was not similar to the ad, and that would result in them abandoning the game soon after installing. This would frustrate their goal of attracting players to the community and against their responsible app advertising initiative. The specific ads had over 80% retention rate from players who had installed after being shown the targeted puzzle ads. Given the game’s breadth and scope, it was difficult to showcase the entire game experience. Because the ads were targeting adults who had interest in puzzle games, they showed them the aspect that was most likely to be interesting to them. They pointed to their “Responsible App Advertising” initiative, which included the goal of ads authentically depicting the game’s content.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so. The ad included footage of a sniper character shooting different barrels that were rolling towards the character, each with a different number on it. Roman centurions idly stood on top of some of the barrels. The caption stated, “Navigate obstacles, unleash devastating attacks”. The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the ad that the game mainly featured a puzzle solving element that involved shooting targets, while having to avoid obstacles, such as the rolling barrels. We understood that the ad included one aspect of the gameplay, namely the puzzle solving element. We compared the footage of the ad with the first gameplay video provided by Evony. While not identical, the gameplay and graphics were comparable to those of the ad and provided a similar gaming experience. We also reviewed a second gameplay footage video of another puzzle, which featured the character navigating obstacles to cross through a path, without shooting targets. We therefore understood that the game featured a puzzle similar to that shown in the ad, and that it was one of a number of different puzzles. However, we further understood that Evony was not primarily a puzzle game. It also included player versus player, player versus environment and city-building aspects, with the city-building element being the game’s core gameplay. Although players could choose to play only one of the aspects of the game, such as the puzzles, they were not able to progress through the storyline without engaging with all elements. If players did not level up in the core gameplay, they were eventually locked out of the puzzles. For those reasons we concluded that the ad did not reflect the game’s core playing experience and was therefore misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading advertising).",The ad must not appear again in its current from.

ASA Ruling on Easigrass (Distribution) Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A Facebook post and website for Easigrass, an artificial grass supplier: a. The Facebook post on the Easigrass account, published on 9 June 2023, featured text that stated “Today we installed our first garden with our new fully recyclable Kensington Eco grass [shocked face emoji]…We [green heart emoji] this…We took out their old grass to replace with the best quality and fully recyclable grass!”. b. The website for Easigrass www.easigrass.com, seen on 5 October 2023, featured a product webpage for “Kensington Eco 38mm” artificial grass. At the top of the page, a box contained a tick next to text that stated “Eco friendly”. Further text on the webpage stated “Fully recyclable”, and an image of the artificial grass was accompanied by a recycling logo labelled with the text “fully recyclable”. A second webpage titled “How to upcycle artificial lawn offcuts” included a text box that stated “recycling”. The webpage featured the text “While installing a synthetic lawn is a great alternative to natural grass, many still question its environmental impact. Thankfully it offers a range of environmental benefits that include reducing water usages and the use of harmful pesticides, but it doesn’t stop there. Your artificial grass offcuts provide a fantastic opportunity for you to help the environment […] This is a great way to utilise your offcuts while creating an eye-catching feature wall for your garden that ticks all the environmental boxes”.","Five complainants, including Plastics Rebellion, challenged whether: 1. the claim “fully recyclable” was misleading and could be substantiated; and 2. the name “Kensington Eco grass” and the claims “it offers a range of environmental benefits” and “ticks all the environmental boxes” misleadingly implied the product was eco-friendly, because they believed artificial grass was damaging to the environment.","1. Easigrass said their Kensington ECO range of artificial grass had an alternative backing, which enabled the product to be completely recyclable. They said they worked with three recycling centres in Germany, Amsterdam and Denmark that offered mechanical recycling, and that process enabled them to reuse polymer materials. For contractual reasons, however, they were unable to provide further details of the full recycling process. They also said that there was a recycling centre in Scotland, where UK-based consumers could recycle ‘Kensington Eco Grass’ independently. They intended to be able to offer a recycling service to all customers in the future, either by running an in-house recycling facility, or to have an agreement in place with the main recycling centre in the UK. However, they explained that, in line with the product’s warranty, they didn’t expect consumers would need to recycle the product until 2033, and by that time, the recycling service would be in place. 2. Easigrass explained that, because the Kensington ECO Range could be fully recycled, the product was more environmentally friendly than other traditional artificial grasses that couldn’t be recycled. Nonetheless, they said they would remove the word ‘Eco’ from the product name, and the wording “recycling” and “ticks all environmental boxes” from ad (b).","1. Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim that Kensington Eco-Grass was “fully recyclable” to mean that the entire product was easily recyclable once it had reached the end of its life cycle. We considered that consumers would expect that recycling process to be widely available and easily accessible to UK consumers. We understood the composition of their product was different to that of traditional artificial grass products. A new method of binding pile fibres to the backing of the grass was used, which did not necessitate the use of non-recyclable latex or a polyurethane (PU) coating, which were typically used in the production of artificial grass. In their place, we understood that a recyclable coating was applied to the backing. However, we were not provided with further information about that coating, its recyclable properties or the way in which it would be recycled as part of the product at a recycling plant. As such, we considered that we were not provided with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the artificial grass was fully recyclable. In any case, we understood that the product could only be fully recycled at specialist recycling centres, and at the time the ad was seen, there were only three such locations in mainland Europe, and only one location in the UK. We therefore understood that it would not be possible for UK consumers to easily recycle the artificial grass at local recycling centres. Also, as there was only one centre in the UK which could recycle the materials used in the Kensington Eco artificial grass, we considered that access to recycling facilities for their product were not readily available to consumers. As we were not provided with sufficient evidence of the recyclable nature of the coating, and because of the lack of existing UK infrastructure to process the product, we concluded the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached the CAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 11.1 and 11.4 (Environmental claims). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information. It required that absolute claims must be supported by a high level of substantiation. It also said that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. We considered that the inclusion of “Eco” within the name of the product, as seen in both ads, implied that the artificial grass was “eco-friendly”. The claims “ticks all the environmental boxes” and “offers a range of environmental benefits” in ad (b) were used on a webpage related to the use of artificial grass offcuts. We considered that these would be interpreted by consumers to mean that the use of artificial grass would positively impact the environment in several ways, and reinforced the understanding that the product was “eco-friendly”. We noted that the ads did not contain any qualifications or further information about the basis of those claims. In the absence of further context or qualification, we considered the direct and implied claims that the product was “eco-friendly” would be understood to mean that the advertised product was not harmful to the environment at any point during its full life cycle. We therefore expected to see a high level of substantiation demonstrating that absolute claim. We understood that Easigrass had included the term “eco” within the product name because the grass could be recycled fully at specific recycling centres, unlike traditional artificial grass products. However, as stated above, we understood that only one recycling centre offered that service in the UK, and therefore, recycling the product would likely not be possible for many UK-based consumers. In addition, we understood that the Kensington Eco artificial grass was made from plastic. We considered that, even if it was recycled at the end of its life cycle, the extraction of raw materials and subsequent processing in order to produce the artificial grass had a negative impact on the environment. We understood that the claims “offers a range of environmental benefits” and “ticks all the environmental boxes” referred to a reduction in the use of water and pesticides when replacing real grass with artificial grass, because artificial grass did not need to be watered, nor did it require upkeep with chemical-based products, such as pesticides. We considered that did not demonstrate that the artificial grass had a positive impact on the environment across its full life cycle. Furthermore, we considered that in those circumstances, the product would be used to replace real grass, thereby having a detrimental impact on biodiversity. We acknowledged that Easigrass said they would remove the claims and amend the product name. However, because at the time the ad was seen we considered that consumers would understand that the Kensington Eco.artificial grass was eco-friendly. We had not, however, seen evidence of that regarding the full life cycle of the product and therefore concluded the claims were misleading. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation ), 11.1, 11.3, 11.4 (Environmental claims).",The ads must not appear in their current form. We told Easigrass (Distribution) Ltd to ensure their marketing communications did not mislead as to the ease of the recycling of their products and did not imply their products were environmentally friendly if that was not the case.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/easigrass--distribution--ltd-g23-1215528-easigrass--distribution--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on John Mills Ltd t/a JML Direct,,"A three-minute TV ad for JML’s Hurricane Spin Scrubber, seen on 7 January 2024, depicted a number of women using the cleaning tool in bathrooms, kitchens and other home environments. The ad included a male and female host. The male host described the product and demonstrated how it worked. Four of the women described their experiences with the tool, saying, “As soon as I started using the spin scrubber, it’s so powerful it made cleaning so much easier”; “I love using the extension pole to get the rings out of the bathtub. I love it”; “I’ve given this to my mother as a gift, and it has changed the way she cleans. I don’t have to worry about her slipping she just clips it in, cleans the top of the shower and I don’t have to worry anymore”; and “My favourite brush is the cone brush, it’s amazing. It gets all the little crevices, nooks and crannies. It gets all that calcium built up around the sink and around the tub and faucets.” A male voice-over concluded, “To get your hands on the Hurricane Spin Scrubber and a sparkling clean home call now, or visit jmldirect.com.”","The complainant, who believed the ad perpetuated harmful gender stereotypes by depicting only women in a role that was stereotypically female, and implying that only women cleaned or were interested in cleaning products, challenged whether it breached the Code.","John Mills Ltd t/a JML stated that they had updated their advertising following an ASA ruling in 2021 regarding a TV ad for the JML Hurricane Spin Scrubber which the ASA had concluded had presented gender stereotypes in a way that was likely to cause harm. They believed that the new ad, which featured a male presenter who was shown demonstrating and using the product, provided more of a gender balance. Clearcast stated that they had taken into consideration the previous ruling and that the new ad was in line with the CAP and BCAP “Advertising Guidance on depicting gender stereotypes likely to cause harm or serious or widespread offence”. The new ad included a male presenter who was shown demonstrating and using the product. The women’s testimonials talked only about the product’s functionality. There was no mention of taking pride in the appearance of their house or being judged for their cleaning, nor was there any mention of cleaning up after other people in the house. They believed this removed any impression of cleaning being solely the woman’s responsibility and never done by men. There was no implication that men could not or would not do cleaning in a house. Although the ad featured people undertaking gender stereotypical roles, they believed the inclusion of the male presenter talking about and demonstrating the product, meant that they avoided suggesting that stereotypical roles, cleaning in this case, were uniquely associated with one gender and not carried out by the other.","Upheld The BCAP Code stated that ads must not include gender stereotypes that were likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence. Joint CAP and BCAP guidance stated that gender-stereotypical characteristics included attributes or behaviours usually associated with a specific gender. The guidance stated that ads may feature people undertaking gender-stereotypical roles, such as showing women cleaning, but they should take care to avoid suggesting that stereotypical roles or characteristics were: always uniquely associated with one gender; the only options available to one gender; or never carried out or displayed by another gender. The ad showed a number of women using the product in domestic settings such as kitchens and bathrooms, three of whom described aspects of the product’s functionality, how that related to what they used it for and how much they liked the product. Another woman described how she gave the product to her mother because she was concerned about her safety when reaching to clean the top of her shower. There were also a number of shots of people cleaning or holding the product which showed only the hand or torso of individuals. The ASA considered that many of the torso shots could be identified as being of women, because of their body-shape. It was not easy, however, to distinguish whether the shots of the hands were those of men or women, because they were brief. The ad also included a male host and a female host. We therefore considered that, with the exception of the male host, the ad only featured people who could be readily identified as women. The only readily identifiable man in the ad was one of the hosts. Whilst he was shown demonstrating the features of the product, he did so in his role as an employee of the company, rather than commenting on or showing how he personally used the product to clean his home. We considered that the juxtaposition of the male host in an authoritative position explaining and demonstrating how the product could be used alongside several women using and talking about their personal experiences of using the product to clean their home, reinforced the harmful gender stereotype that cleaning the home was the responsibility of women, and that men did not share that responsibility. Furthermore, the male host was accompanied by a female host who did not demonstrate or describe the features of the product herself, but instead observed and assisted him. In the context of the ad, we considered that this reinforced the harmful gender stereotype that it was a woman’s role to assist men, which contributed to the wider impression that it was their role to keep the home clean rather than a man’s. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad presented gender stereotypes in a way that was likely to cause harm and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP Code rule 4.14 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told John Mills Ltd t/a JML to ensure that their advertising did not present gender stereotypes in a way that was likely to cause harm, including by suggesting that cleaning the home was a responsibility uniquely associated with women.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/john-mills-ltd-a24-1228444-john-mills-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Vytaliving Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A press ad for Biovit Miracle Cranberry Tablets, seen in the Daily Mail on 13 October 2023, featured an image of a basket of cranberries. The ad was headed “Cranberry Miracle Advanced Bladder Support”. Further text stated “Formulated to promote a healthy urinary tract. Powerful drug-free natural remedy. Vegan-friendly for men and women. Act now. 50% off”. An image further down the ad featured a picture of the product, with text stating “HALF PRICE! CRANBERRY TABLETS. RRP £29.99 NOW ONLY £14.99 P&P. 30-DAY SUPPLY. NEW IMPROVED FORMULATION FOR 2023”. The ad also featured three testimonials from customers, who all praised the product for improving their bladder related issues. That included the claims “I have only been taking these ‘miracle’ tablets a short while and can’t tell you the difference they have made to my life. I went on holiday for a week and forgot to take them and was soon up 2 or 3 times in the night. As soon as I restarted them again, I was back in control” and “I kept my bladder problems a secret for years […] the Biovit Miracle Cranberry is so easy to use. I first noticed the difference a few days later when I felt more confident and didn’t even have to think about where the nearest toilet was”.","The complainant challenged whether the claims: 1. “powerful drug-free natural remedy”, and those within the testimonials, implied that the product treated or cured human disease, which was prohibited by the Code; 2. “advanced bladder support” and “promote a healthy urinary tract” breached the Code, because they were general health claims which must be accompanied by a specific health claim authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims (NHC) register; and 3. RRP and “half price” were misleading and could be substantiated.","1. Vytaliving Ltd said they had, upon receipt of the complaint, consulted an accredited nutritionist to review their ad. They subsequently acknowledged that the claim “powerful drug-free natural remedy” could imply that the Biovit Miracle Cranberry Tablets product treated or cured human disease. They said that the claims within the testimonials were genuine reviews by customers, but accepted they could be interpreted by consumers as being health claims. They said that although they believed there were relevant research papers to support both the claim “powerful drug-free natural remedy” and the claims in the testimonials for cranberry supplements, they acknowledged they were not reduction of disease risk claims authorised in the Great Britain nutrition and health claims (NHC) register. They provided links to those research papers, which were featured on several different science related websites. 2. Vytaliving acknowledged that the statements “advanced bladder support” and “promote a healthy urinary tract” in relation to cranberry supplements were general health claims which were not accompanied by a specific health claim authorised on the GB NHC register. They again stated that, because of the research papers referred to in point 1, they had initially thought the claims were acceptable. 3. Vytaliving acknowledged that they could not substantiate a recommended retail price (RRP) of £29.99 for the product. They said they had intended to sell the product for that price; however, it had only ever sold for £14.99. Although they admitted the RRP claim should have been updated, they believed the multi-buy packages they offered reflected a significant savings value for consumers. For example, they sold a pack of seven for £49.91, which equated to £7.13 per pack. Vytaliving believed that demonstrated that their half price savings claim, when considered in the context of bulk buying, was genuine. They said they had removed the £29.99 RRP claim from their advertising.","1. Upheld Claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease were prohibited under the CAP Code. The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “powerful drug-free natural remedy”, within the context of promoting cranberry supplements for those with bladder issues, to mean the product could treat bladder related conditions. We also considered claims in the testimonials, such as “I have only been taking these ‘miracle’ tablets a short while and can’t tell you the difference they have made to my life” and “I first noticed the difference a few days later when I felt more confident” further implied the product could treat bladder related conditions. We considered that because the ad claimed that the product could prevent, treat or cure human disease, it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 2. Upheld The CAP Code defined claims which referenced the general benefits of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health-related wellbeing as general health claims. Such claims were acceptable only if accompanied by a specific authorised health claim. We considered the claims “advanced bladder support” and “promote a healthy urinary tract” would be understood as references to general, non-specific benefits of the food supplements for the physical health of the bladder and urinary tract. The claims were therefore general health claims that needed to be accompanied by relevant specific authorised health claims. However, because the ad did not include any specific health claims that were authorised on the GB NHC Register, we concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 15.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 3. Upheld The CAP Code stated price comparisons must not mislead by falsely claiming a price advantage. Comparisons with recommended retail prices (RRPs) were likely to mislead if the RRP differed significantly from the price at which the product or service was generally sold. We considered consumers would understand the claim “Act now. 50% off” and “HALF PRICE! CRANBERRY TABLETS. RRP £29.99 NOW ONLY £14.99” to mean that £29.99 was the genuine selling price at which the product was generally marketed and sold, and that consumers would therefore benefit from the stated saving by purchasing the product at the lower price of £14.99. We understood that Vytaliving had only ever sold the product for £14.99. Although they stated consumers could save by bulk buying the product, we considered that was not relevant to the half price savings claim presented in the ad, which was on the basis of one unit of the product being purchased. We therefore concluded that the RRP and savings claim in the ad had not been substantiated and were misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleadingness), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.17 (Prices) and 3.40 (Price Comparisons).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Vytaliving Ltd to ensure that their future ads did not state or imply that their food supplements could prevent, treat or cure human disease and not to make general health claims for their products unless they were accompanied by relevant specific authorised health claims. We also told them to ensure that references to RRPs reflected the price at which the products concerned were generally sold.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/vytaliving-ltd-a23-1216841-vytaliving-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Aldi Stores Ltd t/a Aldi,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A wrap-around four-page national press ad for Aldi, published on 6 December 2023, included on the first page an image of a whole roast turkey, vegetables, Yorkshire puddings, stuffing and gravy. Text stated “THE HOME OF BRITAIN’S CHEAPEST CHRISTMAS DINNER WHY GO ANYWHERE ELSE?”. Further text in a roundel stated “REVIEWED BY Which? Budget-friendly Christmas Dinner” and text in a box underneath stated “2022 PRICE LOCKED”. Small text at the bottom of the page stated “Which? checked the prices of 12 traditional Christmas dinner staples between 6 and 27 November at seven UK supermarkets and found Aldi to be a budget-friendly supermarket for a Christmas dinner shop”. The fourth page of the ad featured the same image and claims, with the additional text “Sainsbury’s £44.81”, “Aldi £33.80” and “Swap & Save over 20% on your Christmas dinner”. It included the same small text at the bottom as on the first page, with the additional text “According to results published by Which?, Aldi’s Christmas dinner came in at over 20% cheaper than Sainsbury’s. For more information, please visit www.aldi.co.uk/which”.","J Sainsbury plc t/a Sainsbury’s challenged whether: 1. the comparative claims “THE HOME OF BRITAIN’S CHEAPEST CHRISTMAS DINNER”, “Sainsbury’s £44.81”, “Aldi £33.80” and “Swap & Save over 20% on your Christmas dinner” were misleading and could be substantiated; 2. the same claims were verifiable; and 3. the claim “2022 PRICE LOCKED” was misleading.","1. Aldi Stores Ltd t/a Aldi said the claims were made in the context of an independent third party comparison by Which?, detailed in an article on the Which? website, titled “Which is the cheapest supermarket for Christmas dinner ingredients”. That was clear in the ad because the roundel that referenced Which? was placed next to the claim “THE HOME OF BRITAIN’S CHEAPEST CHRISTMAS DINNER”. The wording in the roundel was approved by Which?. Aldi felt it was appropriate to rely on the Which? data and not provide their own additional data. It was common market practice and was preferable to providing multiple datasets for substantiation as that would likely confuse consumers. The Which? article stated the pricing data related to the period 6 to 27 November 2023, so it was clear to consumers when the price comparison had been made. Aldi considered the ad should be viewed in context, which included that it was published on 6 December 2023. Consumers would therefore not understand the comparisons to relate to prices charged in the week before Christmas, because that would be impossible. They said that if retailers could only use data collected in the week before Christmas it would prevent them from relying on consumer reports produced by bodies such as Which?, and in practice may also prevent them from preparing price comparison ads in time for the Christmas period. This would similarly apply to other key and seasonal events and would discourage retailers from comparing – and therefore competing on – price for such events. The choice of products to include as Christmas dinner ingredients had been made by Which?. That included the selection of one organic produce item when others were non-organic, some branded and some own-label products, and comparing products that were different weights at some supermarkets. Aldi noted that supermarkets did not always sell the same products in the same quantities, and that CAP Guidance relating to ‘basket of goods’ comparisons allowed that comparisons of branded versus non-branded products could be made so long as the differences were made clear in the ad and the comparison was fair and representative. Aldi acknowledged that some of the products featured in the ad were not included in the Which? Comparison. They but said that the featured products were representative only and consumers could easily see which items had been compared by Which? in the website article. Which? had found that the price differential between Aldi and the second-cheapest supermarket, Lidl, was 4p, and so had also given Lidl a “Budget-friendly Christmas Dinner” award. Aldi asserted that this did not change the fact that they were the cheapest. The claim “BRITAIN’S CHEAPEST CHRISTMAS DINNER” could therefore not be considered misleading on the basis that the difference was small. Furthermore, if the complaint was upheld on that basis, it would create uncertainty in relation to all price comparisons where differences were small, and would discourage ads – and therefore competition – on price. They also considered that factors such as transport costs and consumers’ distance to stores were not relevant factors to consider, because the ad made a specific claim about the price of a selection of goods. Those factors might be relevant if the ad had made a general claim that shopping at Aldi was cheaper for consumers altogether, but it did not. They also believed there was no evidential basis that travel to an Aldi store would be more expensive than to a Lidl store. Aldi considered that the small print in the ad, which provided some detail about the basis of the comparison, was sufficiently prominent and was similar in presentation to small print in other ads. Which? said they were not involved in how Aldi presented the report in their advertising. They said the article was published in early December 2023 to help provide information to consumers in the run-up to Christmas. It set out relevant information, such as the date range for when the data was collected, if they had included a premium product, and a table of the products they compared, which included the weight ranges for the products. They used weight ranges in all their grocery pricing analysis as there tended to be little consistency in the weight of own label groceries across supermarkets. The ranges were set by their external data provider, whose expertise they trusted. The weight ranges tended to be small, and Which? made sure to review and sense check them. The approach allowed them to provide easily digestible data that helped shoppers compare on overall price. 2. Aldi said the verification for the claims was in the Which? article, which stated the weight range of all the products that were compared, as well as the name of the retailer, the product name and the price. Consumers would therefore be able to identify which own-label products had been compared. Aldi also considered the ad adequately signposted where consumers could find the Which? article. The last page of the ad included a link to Aldi’s website (www.aldi.co.uk/which) in the small text, which they considered was sufficiently prominent. The page on their website provided a summary of the Which? article and a direct link to it. The link to Aldi’s website was not included on the first page of the ad because it was limited by space. 3. Aldi said they had used the “2022 PRICE LOCKED” message throughout the Christmas period, including in ads which did not also refer to the Christmas dinner price comparison. Information about the terms and conditions of the price lock claim was available on their website. They believed consumers were familiar with the price lock message and had been educated to understand that it meant that certain products were no more expensive than they were at Christmas 2022. They did not believe that consumers would interpret it, in the context of the ad under investigation, to mean that all Aldi products included in the Christmas dinner comparison were price locked.","1. Upheld The front-page claim “THE HOME OF BRITAIN’S CHEAPEST CHRISTMAS DINNER WHY GO ANYWHERE ELSE?” appeared alongside the roundel which stated “REVIEWED BY Which? Budget-friendly Christmas Dinner”, and above images of a whole roast turkey, roast potatoes, gravy, stuffing, Yorkshire puddings, carrots, Brussels sprouts and parsnips. A further roundel appeared at the bottom of the page that stated “NOVEMBER 2023 Which? Cheapest Basket”. In that context the ASA considered consumers would understand that the total cost of buying the ingredients at Aldi for a typical Christmas dinner would be cheaper than in any other British supermarket, so there would be no reason to shop around. We considered they would further understand that the price comparison was based on Which? research and that Which? had given Aldi a “cheapest Christmas dinner” award. While small text at the bottom of the ad stated that the comparison related to “seven UK supermarkets”, we considered the text was so small that many readers would overlook it, and it was therefore insufficiently prominent to counteract the impression that the comparison related to all British supermarkets. The back page of the ad featured the same main claim, Which? roundel, and imagery, and also included the claims “Sainsbury’s £44.81”, “Aldi £33.80” and “Swap & Save over 20% on your Christmas dinner”. We considered consumers would understand that page in the same way as the front page, but also that it was highlighting the specific price difference for the total cost of a typical Christmas dinner between Sainsbury’s and Aldi, as found by Which?. We acknowledged that Which? was an authoritative resource for consumers who were looking to compare products and services based on a range of considerations, including price. However, where advertisers chose to include comparisons with their competitors in their advertising they were required to hold adequate evidence to substantiate those claims, and to ensure the claims were not misleading. That was the case whether the claims were based on data they had collated themselves or on third party data. We reviewed the substantiation for Aldi’s advertising claims, which was contained in article on the Which? website relating to the price comparison. The comparison included seven UK supermarkets, rather than all British supermarkets as would be understood by consumers who saw the ad. We also noted that the Which? article stated that the Christmas dinner was only 4p cheaper at Aldi compared to Lidl, and that “as this difference was negligible Which? decided to embrace the Christmas spirit by giving both of the discounters a festive food pricing crown”. Which? therefore had not awarded Aldi as the “cheapest Christmas dinner” as implied by the overall presentation of the ad, but as a “Budget-friendly Christmas Dinner”. While Aldi was technically the cheapest, this was by a negligible amount, and we considered that it was information that was likely to influence consumers’ understanding of the claim and any transactional decision they might make because of it, since their choice of which supermarket to visit would also be impacted by other factors such as their relative distances or transport costs. We therefore considered the ad was misleading about the basis of the comparison in those regards. Sainsbury’s believed one reason the ad was misleading was because the price comparison was not representative of prices during the period when consumers would be purchasing fresh produce for their Christmas dinner. They said supermarkets generally introduced final prices and promotions for typical Christmas dinner items in the last week or so before Christmas, and highlighted that the comparison primarily included fresh products with a short shelf life (seven out of 12 products). We acknowledged the ad’s small text stated the date range when the comparison was conducted, but as referenced above we considered readers would be likely to overlook that information because it was insufficiently prominent. Notwithstanding that, we considered consumers would understand that the intention of the ad was to encourage them to choose Aldi for their Christmas dinner shop specifically, which would include a range of fresh products which could only be purchased shortly before Christmas day, because it would be cheaper than any other supermarket. As such, consumers would expect that the comparison was based on the prices they would pay in the week or so before Christmas, despite the fact that the ad was published in advance of that period. Because the comparison related to price checks conducted between 6 and 27 November and prices were likely to have changed by the time consumers would be purchasing their Christmas dinner, we considered the ad was also misleading in that regard. The comparison related to 12 products. While Christmas dinner differed between households, we considered that the products represented a selection of items that were likely to be included in a typical ‘Christmas dinner’ by many consumers. Notwithstanding that, we considered consumers would expect that all the foods featured in the ad would have been included in the comparison. That was not the case: the ad featured a whole turkey, when the comparison related to a turkey crown; and Yorkshire puddings and stuffing, which were not included in the comparison at all. We considered the ad was misleading about the basis of the comparison in that regard. Sainsbury’s had also queried the selection of products in that one produce item was organic (broccoli) whereas the others were non-organic, and some products were own-label and others were branded. It was not clear why the selection of items was not consistent in these regards. However, we considered that in principle this was acceptable so long as it was clear to consumers which items had been compared, and the selections did not skew the comparison in favour of one supermarket over another. The same items had been compared across the supermarkets and the table on the Which? website specified what the items were (save for the weights – see below). We did not have reason to believe the selection of items had skewed the comparison. The table in the Which? article listed the 12 products, the product weight, and the price of the product at each supermarket. However, in seven of the 12 comparisons, the table stated a weight range for the product. For example, for own-label pigs-in-blankets, it indicated the weight of the compared items ranged from 175g to 300g at different supermarkets, meaning the smallest item was a little over half the size of the largest. We considered that without an indication of the specific weight of the product at each supermarket alongside the price, the basis of the comparison was not clear and could not be adequately substantiated. We further considered it was necessary to make this clear because consumers would be taking into account the number of people eating Christmas dinner, and the product weight/pack size was therefore likely to influence their purchasing decision. We considered the ad was misleading in that regard. For the reasons set out above, we concluded that the claim “THE HOME OF BRITAIN’S CHEAPEST CHRISTMAS DINNER” and the claims specifically comparing the price of Christmas dinner at Aldi with Sainsbury’s were misleading and had not been substantiated. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.9 and 3.10 (Qualification), 3.17 (Prices), 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors) and 3.39 (Price comparisons). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that comparisons with identifiable competitors must be verifiable. That meant that an ad which featured a comparison with an identifiable competitor or competitors needed to include, or direct consumers to, sufficient information to allow them to understand the comparison, and be able to check the claims were accurate, or ask someone suitably qualified to do so. The ad was a wraparound, meaning the first page of the ad was the front of the newspaper, and the final page of the ad was the back of the newspaper. We considered that separation meant that some readers would have seen only the first page of the ad, and therefore any signpost to information that would allow consumers to verify the comparative claims should have appeared on both pages where the claims were made. We further considered there was sufficient space on both pages to include such a signpost, in text large enough that it would not be overlooked by readers. Both pages included the roundels that referenced Which?, but we considered those were not sufficient to signpost consumers to where they could find information about the comparison. The first page of the ad did not include any information as to where consumers could verify the comparison. The final page of the ad included the text “According to results published by Which?, Aldi’s Christmas dinner came in at over 20% cheaper than Sainsbury’s. For more information, please visit www.aldi.co.uk/which” in small print. We considered that wording made clear that consumers could find information about the comparison with Sainsbury’s on that webpage, but not that information about the broader comparison with all supermarkets could also be found there. Additionally, as referenced at point 1, we considered the text was likely to be overlooked by readers. As such we considered that neither the first nor final page of the ad adequately signposted where consumers could find information that would allow them to verify the price comparisons. As also referenced above at point 1, the verification information on the Which? website did not make clear the weight of each product at each supermarket. We considered that was information that was necessary for consumers to be able to understand, and therefore verify, the comparison. We concluded the price comparison was not verifiable, because the ad did not adequately signpost where consumers could find information to verify it, and because the verification information was not sufficient for consumers to understand it or check it was accurate. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.35 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors). 3. Upheld The claim “2022 PRICE LOCKED” appeared alongside the claim “THE HOME OF BRITAIN’S CHEAPEST CHRISTMAS DINNER”, below the roundel that referred to the “Which? Budget-friendly Christmas Dinner”, and above the images of Christmas dinner foods, on both the front and back pages of the ad. The ad did not include any further information regarding the price lock claims. In that context we considered that consumers would understand that the price of all the foods included in the Christmas dinner price comparison (which as referenced above we considered consumers would understand to include all the foods featured in the ad), were the same price at Aldi at Christmas 2023 as they had been at Christmas 2022. However, Aldi’s ‘price lock’ did not include gravy, stuffing or Yorkshire pudding (as featured in the ad), or Bird’s Eye garden peas, Albert Bartlett rooster potatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, cranberry sauce or Knorr chicken stock pots (as included in the Which? comparison). We therefore concluded the ad misled as to the products that were included in Aldi’s ‘2022 price lock’. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.17 (Prices).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Aldi Stores Ltd t/a Aldi to ensure that price comparisons with their competitors were not misleading, and that the basis of such comparisons was clear and adequately substantiated. That included that price comparisons which would be understood by consumers to relate to products to be bought during a specific time period were substantiated by evidence relating to prices that applied during that time period. We told them to ensure that they provided sufficient information for consumers to be able to verify competitor comparisons for themselves. We also told them to ensure their ads did not make misleading comparisons with their own previous prices.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/aldi-stores-ltd-a23-1226863-aldi-stores-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Electronic Arts Ltd t/a EA,,"Two paid-for Facebook ads for Golf Clash, a mobile app game: a. The first ad, seen in August 2023, showed a video of a man pointing to on-screen text that stated “5% EXTRA BALLS AND GEMS THROUGH PURCHASES”, “DAILY LOG IN BONUS” and “SIGN UP TO OUR NEWSLETTER FOR 500 GEMS”. The caption stated, “The Golf Clash Web Store is now live! [trophy emoji][coin emoji] Head on over and check out our awesome deals! Log in now and claim your Daily Login Bonus Chest! https://store.playdemic.com/”. b. The second ad, seen in September 2023, featured an image of a virtual golf course, with the Golf Clash logo, a sign for “Tour Championship” and text which stated, “STARTS ON 21 AUGUST 2023”. The caption stated, “When reaching 'Gold Prestige', convert all leftover balls into 'Generation Tokens'”.","The complainant, an academic researcher in game regulation, who understood that the game and webstore contained random-item purchasing (‘loot boxes), challenged whether the ads were misleading because they omitted material information.","Electronic Arts Ltd t/a EA said that the ads were mistakenly published without the prescribed disclosure. They explained that they had a company policy which required paid ads for games that included in-game purchases and random-item purchases to contain the text “Includes optional in-game purchases (includes random items)” prominently within the ad. In ads (a) and (b), they explained that the omission of the disclosure was a result of human error and was not representative of the standard policies and practices they had in place to ensure their ads were compliant. They confirmed that the error had been resolved and the ads had been removed. They reiterated their commitment to compliant advertising.","Upheld The ASA understood that the items received in a loot box were based on chance, and that a player would not know what items they had received in the box until the transaction was completed. CAP Guidance stated that the presence of in-game purchasing, and particularly random-item purchasing (loot boxes), was material to a consumer’s decision to purchase or download a game, especially for those with specific vulnerabilities. As such, marketers were required to ensure that advertising for the game made clear that it contained in-game purchasing and, if relevant, that it included loot boxes. We understood that the Golf Clash game contained virtual currency and functional items, such as golf balls and clubs, that were available to purchase, as well as loot boxes in the form of chests. They were available to purchase in-game, as well as through the webstore. Ad (a) announced the launch of the Golf Clash webstore and referred to “purchases” and “awesome deals” which could be made on the webstore. As such, we considered consumers would understand that the function of the webstore was to purchase items to use in the game. However, we noted that there was no further statement about the presence of loot boxes, which could also be purchased in the game webstore. We therefore considered the information included in ad (a) was not sufficient for consumers to understand that loot boxes were available to be purchased on the game webstore. We further noted that ad (b), an ad for the game itself, did not contain any information to indicate to consumers that the game included in-game purchases and loot boxes. We therefore considered the ad omitted material information that would affect a consumer’s transactional decision, such as the decision to download the game. We acknowledged that ads (a) and (b) were published without the disclosure about in-game purchases and loot boxes that was prescribed by the advertiser’s internal policy as a result of human error and we welcomed the advertiser’s engagement with the CAP Code and guidance. Nonetheless, because ad (a) did not make clear that the webstore included loot boxes, and ad (b) did not make clear that the game included in-game purchases or loot boxes, we concluded that the ads misleadingly omitted material information. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).","The ad must not appear in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Jagex Ltd,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for RuneScape, an online game, seen in September 2023, featured various scenes of gameplay highlighting the game’s new combat style, Necromancy. The caption stated, “Harness the dark art of Necromancy to defeat the First Necromancer” and contained a button labelled “Play Game”, which linked to a website landing page for the game.","The complainant, an academic researcher in game regulation, who understood that the game contained in-game purchases, including random-item purchasing (loot boxes), challenged whether the ad was misleading because it omitted material information.","Jagex Ltd confirmed that RuneScape was free to play and contained in-game purchases, which included random-item purchasing, in a mini-game called Treasure Hunter. They explained that the mini game required players to open chests containing items of value using keys which could be obtained in three different ways: earned through gameplay; purchased with real-world currency; or purchased with virtual currency that was only obtainable through gameplay. They highlighted that the ad did not promote the mini game but advertised the new “necromancy skill” launched within the game in August 2023. Jagex believed the paid-for Facebook ad was constrained by time and space. As such, they had taken measures to ensure that consumers had all relevant information about the game by other means, before making the decision to download and play the game. They explained that the ad linked to a landing page which flagged the presence of in-game purchases and loot boxes in several areas. They explained that the footer of the landing page displayed three PEGI labels, including the label for in-game purchases, as well as text underneath which stated, “In-game Purchases (Includes Random Items)”. Those PEGI labels contained links to the PEGI website, where additional information was available to consumers about the specific in-game purchases and loot boxes included in the game. The landing page contained three further links via clickable buttons or icons leading to pages that displayed the same PEGI labels as detailed above. The home page, which could be accessed from the landing page, contained a drop-down menu which led to a dedicated page for the Treasure Hunter mini game. This page explained the mechanics of the game and included the same PEGI labels as at the footer. The landing page also contained a link to the terms and conditions of the game, which included information about virtual currencies and mini game credits. Upon download of the game, similar PEGI information was available under the character selection drop-down menu, which informed consumers that in-game purchases were present in the game. They therefore considered that the landing page, which would be accessed through the ad, contained sufficient information about the presence of in-game purchases and loot boxes to ensure consumers were made aware of their presence prior to downloading the game. Jagex referred to the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (the CPRs) which defined a consumer’s transactional decision as any decision taken by a consumer about whether, how and on what terms to buy, pay in whole or in part for, retain or dispose of a product. They also referred to the CAP Guidance, which stated that information about in-game purchases and random item purchasing was material to the decision to purchase or download a game. In this way, they argued that the transactional decision in this case was the decision to purchase or download RuneScape, which they pointed out, could not be done from the ad itself. Because the relevant information that was material to the decision to purchase or download the game was disclosed prior to that decision being made, they believed the ad did not breach the Code.","Upheld The ASA understood that the items received in a loot box were based on chance, and that a player would not know what items they had received in the box until the transaction was completed.

Although we acknowledged that the presence of in-game purchases and random item purchases were disclosed once the consumer clicked through to the landing page, we considered that the ad itself did not include information which made that clear to consumers. Transactional decisions encompassed a wide range of decisions made by the consumer in relation to a product and their decision of whether, how and on what terms to make a purchase. The decision to click through to the RuneScape website (including, in this case, by clicking a button labelled “Play Game”) from the ad was a transactional decision in relation to downloading the game, and we considered that consumers were not provided with information that was material to that decision. We noted Jagex’s assertion that the ad was constrained by time and space and, therefore, it had been necessary to include such disclosure in the landing page linked to by the ad. The ad was a paid-for Facebook post; the recommended character length for which was 125 characters in the primary text field, 40 characters in the headline field and 25 characters in the description field. We considered those requirements were not sufficiently limiting and, consequently, did not prevent the text “In-game Purchases (Includes Random Items)”, as disclosed in the landing page, from appearing in the ad. In any case, we considered that the medium did not preclude the display of the relevant PEGI label within the video graphic. Because the ad did not make clear that the game contained in-game purchases, including loot boxes, which we considered was material to a consumer’s transactional decision, we concluded that the ad misleadingly omitted material information. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Jagex Ltd to ensure that ads for RuneScape disclosed the presence of in-game purchases and random-item purchases (loot boxes).,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/jagex-ltd-a23-1216471-jagex-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Lindar Media Ltd t/a MRQ.com,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for gaming website MrQ.com, seen on 23 December 2023, featured text stating “[Santa emoji] Deposit £20 and get 75 Free Spins [Present emoji]”. An image below the text featured a cartoon Santa driving a snow plough underneath the “BIG BASS Christmas BASH” game logo. A second image featured the same Santa driving a vehicle next to an elf holding a colourful Bazooka.","The complainant, who believed the cartoon imagery of Santa and the elf was likely to appeal strongly to children, challenged whether the ad beached the Code.","Lindar Media Ltd t/a MrQ.com said that whist the imagery in the ad may be deemed as ”likely to appeal strongly to children”, they specifically targeted the ad at people aged over 25 years, and did not believe that anyone under 25 had seen the ad. MrQ.com believed that having applied the Facebook targeting so that the ad had been kept away from children and young people, they had acted in a socially responsible way. MrQ.com referred to the CAP guidance on “Gambling and lotteries: Protecting under-18s”, specifically that ads targeted in such a way as to effectively remove under-18s from the audience could feature content that would otherwise be prohibited. They had also considered guidance from the IGRG (Industry Group for Responsible Gambling) Industry Code for Socially Responsible Advertising. They said they had now amended their Facebook marketing approach, in particular to have regard to whether the imagery in their ads was likely to have strong appeal to children. MrQ.com confirmed that the ad had been withdrawn. Facebook did not have any comments in relation to the complaint.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that gambling ads must not be likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture. They must not include a person or character whose example was likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who had strong appeal to those aged under-18. The ASA considered that Christmas and the traditions surrounding it were likely to have strong appeal to children. Furthermore, the CAP guidance on “Gambling and lotteries: Protecting under-18s” stated Santa Clause was considered high risk in terms of how likely the character was to be of strong appeal to under-18s. We considered that, in a similar vein, children were likely also to find the Christmas elf character appealing. The characters were depicted as colourful cartoons, which, we considered, added to the likelihood of the imagery appealing to children. For those reasons, we considered the ad was likely to be of strong appeal to children. We considered that it would have been acceptable for the ad to appear in a medium where under-18s, for all intents and purposes, could be entirely excluded from the audience. That would apply in circumstances where those who saw the ad had been robustly age-verified as being 18 or older, such as through marketing lists that had been validated by payment data or credit checking. However, because Facebook was a media environment where users self-verified on customer sign-up and did not use robust age-verification, we considered MrQ.com had not excluded under-18s from the audience with the highest level of accuracy required for gambling ads where their content was likely to appeal strongly to under-18s. We acknowledged the steps MrQ.com had taken in response to the complaint but, for the reasons stated above, we nevertheless concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1 and 16.3.12 (Gambling).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Lindar Media Ltd t/a MrQ.com not to include themes or imagery that were likely to have strong appeal to those under 18 years of age in their ads in future.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/lindar-media-ltd-a23-1226999-lindar-media-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on MNG-Mango UK Ltd,,"A product listing for a short sleeve sweater on clothing retailer MANGO’s app, seen on 29 December 2023, featured an image of a model wearing the sweater with their arms by the sides.","The complainant, who believed the model appeared unhealthily thin, challenged whether the ad was irresponsible.",MNG-MANGO UK Ltd t/a MANGO did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"Upheld The ASA was concerned by MNG-MANGO UK Ltd’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The model was shown wearing a short sleeved sweater with their arms by their side. The ASA considered that the model’s upper body and hips appeared to be very narrow and there were gaps between her arms and body, accentuating her slender frame. Both of the model’s arms, which were visible from above the elbow, were very thin. Her upper arms appeared noticeably thinner above her elbow joints which protruded. Because the model appeared to be unhealthily thin, we concluded that the ad was irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising) and 1.7 (Unreasonable delay).",The ad must not appear in its current form. We told MNG-MANGO UK Ltd t/a MANGO to ensure that the images in their ads were prepared responsibly and did not portray models as being unhealthily thin.

ASA Ruling on Miniclip (UK) Ltd,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for 8 Ball Pool, an online game, seen on 26 September 2023, featured various scenes of gameplay and ended with prominent on-screen text which stated, “PLAY FREE NOW”. The ad included a link to the game on the Apple App Store.","The complainant, an academic researcher in game regulation, who understood that the game contained in-game purchases, including random-item purchasing (loot boxes), challenged whether the ad was misleading because it omitted material information.","Miniclip (UK) Ltd believed that material information had not been omitted from the ad because the game did not require users to make a purchase in order to play and progress. However, they confirmed that the ad had been withdrawn after being notified of the complaint and said that future ads would not omit such material information.","Upheld The ASA understood that the items received in a ‘loot box’ were based on chance, and that a player would not know what items they had received in the box until the transaction was completed. CAP Guidance stated that the presence of in-game purchasing, and particularly random-item purchasing (loot boxes), was material to a consumer’s decision to purchase or download a game, especially for consumers with specific vulnerabilities. As such, marketers should ensure that advertising for the game made clear that it contained in-game purchasing and, if relevant, that it included random-item purchasing. We understood that 8 Ball Pool contained virtual currency and functional items, like cues, that were available to purchase, as well as loot boxes, such as ‘golden spins’. We noted that the ad for 8 Ball Pool did not contain any information to indicate to consumers that the game contained in-game purchases, including loot boxes. We therefore considered consumers would not understand from the ad that the game contained in game-purchases or loot boxes. We acknowledged that Miniclip withdrew the ad on receipt of the complaint and provided an assurance that future ads would comply with the requirements of the CAP Code. Nonetheless, because the ad did not make clear that the game contained in-game purchases or loot boxes, which we considered was material to consumers’ decisions to download the game, we concluded that the ad misleadingly omitted material information. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).","The ad must not appear in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Worldwide Trademarks sro t/a Worldwide Trademarks,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A direct mailing for Worldwide Trademarks, received on 30 October 2023 in an envelope which included the Worldwide Trademarks logo and the text “All About Your Brand Worldwide Comprehensive Realtime Monitoring” in the left-hand corner. Further text on the right of the envelope stated, “If undelivered please return to: Budapest 1005 HUNGARY” followed by “P.P PRIORITARE MAYGAR POSTA BUDAPEST 1005 EPP2”. At the top left of the enclosed letter a box headed “Trademark Information” included a reference number, the “period covered”, the amount of £869.00, a trademark application number and date, and international trademark classes. An image of a specific trademark appeared underneath. Below a separating line, text stated “Payments to our account department”, followed by banking information which included “Mandat Consulting, k.s.” as the beneficiary. To the right, text stated “SERVICE UNTIL 2028” and the price of £869.00. On the right of the page, under the text “TRADEMARK OWNER” was shown in white font in a grey box. Underneath, and justified to the right, the word “OFFER” appeared in small text, with body copy of the same size font underneath that stated “THE FOUNDATION OF OUR OFFER IS PUBLISHING YOUR TRADEMARK” followed by a description of the advertiser’s trademark monitoring service, which included tools to help detect potential conflicts and violations against a trademark. The paragraph concluded with the text “PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS SERVICE IS NOT RELATED TO THE PUBLICATION OF OFFICIAL REGISTRATION AND IS NOT A REGISTRATION BY A GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATION”. Further text stated “THIS OFFER IS NOT AN INVOICE BUT A REQUEST WITHOUT OBLIGATION TO PAY, UNLESS OUR OFFER IS ACCEPTED. ALL OTHER DETAILS ARE INDICATED IN OUR GENERAL CONDITIONS AND GENERAL CONDITIONS OF SALE” with “IS NOT AN INVOICE” in bold text. A box at the bottom of the page included the text “Introducing Weekly Updates on Trademark Similarities”. “General Terms and Conditions” were listed on the back of the page.","The complainant challenged whether the ad was: 1. obviously identifiable as a marketing communication; and 2. misleading, because it had the overall appearance of an invoice.","1. & 2. Worldwide Trademarks SRO said it had not been their intention to mislead and that their direct mailings were meant to be informative and transparent. The ad was not intended to resemble an invoice and did not include any of the requirements of one, such as an invoice and tax number. They took great care to explicitly state that the letter was an “offer” multiple times, in a font consistent with the rest of the content. They also highlighted that “IS NOT AN INVOICE”, as part of the statement “THIS OFFER IS NOT AN INVOICE”, was printed in bold. They explained that their clients were commercial customers, and that their services were designed to assist both existing trademark owners and new applicants in monitoring and protecting their intellectual property rights effectively. They said they prioritised customer satisfaction and had strict refund policies in place to address concerns clients may have.","1. Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications were obviously identifiable as such, meaning that recipients should be able to tell from the envelope itself that it was a marketing communication. While the front of the envelope included corporate branding and an address in Budapest, the ASA considered that was not sufficient to ensure that the envelope was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication. For that reason, we concluded that the ad breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications). 2. Upheld As referenced above the CAP Code required that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such. Additionally, they must not materially mislead or be likely to do so, including by hiding material information or presenting it in an unclear or ambiguous manner. We considered that the overall appearance of the letter inside the envelope resembled an invoice, because it included typical elements such as a header with company information, a reference number, the recipient’s information including their trademark details, a payment amount and payment instructions. Those elements were presented in a layout typically seen in an invoice, with Worldwide Trademarks’ logo in the header, the recipient’s information underneath, the payment amounts in a box within the body of the letter and the payment details at the bottom. While we acknowledged that small text on the right of the letter described the service provided by Worldwide Trademarks, including referring to it as an “offer”, and stated in bold font that the letter was “NOT AN INVOICE”, we considered that this was not sufficient to counteract the initial impression that the letter was an invoice rather than a marketing communication. Because the ad was presented in a way that misleadingly resembled an invoice and was not obviously identifiable as a marketing communication, we concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications), 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Worldwide Trademarks SRO to ensure future mailings were obviously identifiable as marketing communications and did not mislead, including by ensuring that envelopes made clear that they contained a marketing communication, and not presenting ads in such a way that they could be understood to be an invoice.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/worldwide-trademarks-sro-a23-1222525-worldwide-trademarks-sro.html
ASA Ruling on Global Brands Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A TikTok post from the account of Danielle Walsh (@danniwalsh123), posted on 5 October 2023. The video showed Danielle Walsh standing behind a bar, with a row of glasses in front of her, and music playing in the background. Addressing the camera, Danielle Walsh stated, “So for pres [sic] tonight, let me show you what we’re drinking. We’re going to do four in one, because we’re getting lit tonight.” She then made four cocktails, using different flavours of the VK alcopop brand mixed with spirits including vodka, peach schnapps, Amaretto and whiskey liqueur, which were free poured into the glasses. After making each drink, she stated, “Let’s try it!” and quickly drank each drink. On-screen images of recipes for each cocktail appeared as they were made, which included the name of the cocktail, its ingredients, and featured the VK logo. Text at the bottom of the video stated, “Lets [sic] make some drinkssss… #forprestonight #woowoo #partystarter #venom #cocktails #vk #letstryit #letsgetlit”.","1. The complainant challenged whether the ad was irresponsible, because it encouraged excessive consumption of alcohol and featured alcohol being served irresponsibly. 2. The ASA challenged whether the post was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication.","1. & 2. Global Brands Ltd t/a VK confirmed that they had provided Danielle Walsh with the alcoholic drinks used in the ad, in return for her promotion of their brand via her TikTok channel. They explained that they had asked Ms Walsh to create a series of videos which showed the creation of each cocktail, rather than one video in which four cocktails were made and consumed. They had stipulated that their products should be promoted in a responsible manner, and had asked to approve the videos prior to their publication. They said that had not happened, however, and that Ms Walsh had posted the videos without their final approval. VK accepted that the video should have been clearly labelled as an ad. They said they had asked Ms Walsh’s agent to remove the video on several occasions, but their requests had not been acknowledged. Danielle Walsh said that VK had not paid her for the post, and said she would remove the video while it was under investigation. TikTok said the promotion of alcohol was prohibited on their platform, and that the ad had been deleted by the creator. They said had the creator engaged with TikTok’s disclosure tool as required by their terms of service, it would not have been permitted to be posted organically because the promotion of alcohol was prohibited under their Branded Content Policy.","1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be socially responsible and not contain anything that was likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinks that were unwise, including encouraging excessive drinking. The Code also required marketing communications not to feature alcohol being handled or served irresponsibly. The video opened with Danielle Walsh stating, “So for pres tonight, let me show you what we’re drinking.” The ASA understood that “pres” was a reference to “pre-drinking” or “pre-drinks”, the practice of consuming alcohol at home before going out to a pub, bar or club, where further alcohol would be consumed. We understood that pre-drinking was often intended to achieve intoxication prior to attending a licensed venue and, as such, we considered that referencing “pres” in the ad implied that alcohol was going to be consumed in excessive amounts. Ms Walsh then stated, “We’re going to do four in one, because we’re getting lit tonight.” We understood that the word “lit” had a long history of being used as a slang term for being drunk. While we noted that the phrase had other meanings, because the ad was focused on the creation and consumption of an alcoholic drink, and was set in a bar, we considered that consumers would likely associate the phrase “we’re getting lit tonight” to relate to the excessive consumption of alcohol and becoming intoxicated. We also considered that the comment “We’re going to do four in one” stated Ms Walsh’s intention to drink four cocktails in one video, which further implied the excessive consumption of alcohol. As the video continued Ms Walsh made a series of cocktails using alcoholic VK products mixed with spirits such as vodka, peach schnapps, amaretto and whiskey liqueur. She did not measure any of the ingredients in the drinks, free pouring the alcohol throughout. We noted that the volume of “mixer”, the non-alcoholic component of a mixed drink, in each cocktail was minimal. We considered that by free pouring the amount of alcohol in each cocktail, the ad depicted alcohol being served irresponsibly. Furthermore, Ms Walsh quickly drank each cocktail after making it, consuming all four drinks in under 90 seconds, which demonstrated that excessive amounts of alcohol had been consumed over a short space of time. Because the ad encouraged excessive drinking and depicted alcohol being handled and served irresponsibly we concluded that it was irresponsible, and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 18.1 and 18.11 (Alcohol). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and that they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. In assessing whether the post was an ad for the purposes of the Code, we noted that while Danielle Walsh said she had not been paid by VK to create the video, VK had confirmed in their response to the ASA that they had provided her with the products free of charge in return for her promotion of their brand, which we considered constituted payment. We also noted that VK had provided Ms Walsh with instructions to create four separate videos, stipulated that the posts should be responsible in nature, and requested to review the videos prior to their publication. We therefore considered that VK had editorial control over the post, despite some of their requests being disregarded by Ms Walsh. Because there was both payment to Ms Walsh and editorial control over the post, we considered that it was an ad for the purposes of the Code. We then assessed whether the post was obviously identifiable as an ad. We noted that the on-screen images of recipes for the cocktails featured the VK logo, and that the hashtags at the bottom of the post included “VK”. However, the on-screen images were small in size and only briefly visible. In any case, we did not consider that the recipe images made clear that there was a commercial relationship between Ms Walsh and the VK brand. The “VK” hashtag was not visible unless viewers expanded the text at the bottom of the screen. Regardless of its visibility, we did not consider that it was sufficient to indicate to consumers that the post was an ad. While Ms Walsh made regular references to the VK brand throughout the video, she did not make any mention that the post was an ad, and the video contained no other identifiers to her relationship with VK. We therefore concluded that the post was not obviously identifiable as a marketing communication, and did not make clear its commercial intent. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 (Recognition of marketing communications).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Global Brands Ltd t/a VK and Danielle Walsh to ensure that their future ads did not encourage excessive consumption of alcohol, or feature alcohol being served irresponsibly. We also told VK and Ms Walsh to ensure that future ads were obviously identifiable as such, for example by including a clear and prominent identifier, such as “AD”.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/global-brands-ltd-a23-1215641-global-brands-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on LeoVegas Gaming plc t/a BetUK,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work banning gambling ads which, under strengthened rules, are prohibited from being likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s.","A radio ad for BetUK, heard on 27 September 2023, featured retired footballer Adebayo Akinfenwa stating that he was a brand ambassador for the company. He went on to say, “You can now find a range of tools on the BetUK website. You can set deposit limits, schedule reality checks and set timeouts to help you stay in control. Always gamble responsibly at BetUK.”","The complainant challenged whether the ad featured an individual who was likely to be of strong appeal to those under 18 years of age, and therefore breached the Code.","LeoVegas Gaming plc t/a BetUK said they had given full consideration to the Joint CAP and BCAP Advertising Guidance “Gambling and lotteries advertising: protecting under-18s” (the B/CAP guidance) when assessing Mr Akinfenwa. They believed that he did not appeal strongly to under-18s. They believed that, because Mr Akinfenwa was 41 years old and a former footballer who had retired in May 2022, he was unlikely to be popular with under-18s. They explained that during his professional football career, he was not considered a ‘star’ player and he never played for a club in the Premier League. He spent the majority of his career playing for League One and League Two clubs, with only a brief amount of time spent playing in the Championship. Although he had played a small number of matches since retiring, those were charity matches and games which involved non-league clubs. Because his whole career was spent outside of the Premier League, BetUK considered his appeal to under-18s, as defined by the B/CAP guidance, was “low risk”. Outside of his career as a footballer, BetUK said Mr Akinfenwa’s general media profile did not indicate he was likely to be of strong appeal to children. They said he had a clothing range (BeastModeOn), which they claimed had broad appeal and was marketed at people aged 16-66. They said he did not advertise any child-related products. BetUK said Mr Akinfenwa had active accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok and Snapchat. They said he posted content on a wide range of sports, including American football and boxing, as well as football. They said that on Instagram he had 116,200 followers who were under 18, which was 8% of his total followers on that platform, and on Snapchat 41,080 followers who were under 18, which was 13% of his total followers on that platform. They said age demographics were unavailable for Facebook, Twitter/X and TikTok. BetUK also said the ad, which promoted ways to gamble responsibly, did not feature any content of a childish tone and was played during a radio show which was likely to have an adult audience. Radiocentre agreed with the response BetUK provided and did not have any further comments to add.","Upheld From 1 October 2022, the BCAP Code stated that marketing communications for gambling products must not be likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture. They must not include a person or character whose example was likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who had strong appeal to those aged under 18. The ASA expected advertisers to provide evidence that they had identified what persons or characters were generally known for outside the context of an ad, and had used appropriate sources of data and information to assess their likely level of appeal to under-18s, including by assessing the personal profile and following of the person or character (including social media follower demographics). We considered anyone with a significant under-18 following on social media was of “high risk” of appealing strongly to children. We acknowledged that Mr Akinfenwa spent the majority of his football career playing for clubs in Leagues One and Two, which were the third and fourth tiers of English football respectively. He spent one season playing in the Championship, which was the second tier, for Wycombe Wanderers, but he had never played for a club in the Premier League. He had also never represented his country in international football and had not played for any prominent clubs abroad. The B/CAP guidance classed footballers at lower league and non-league clubs as ""low risk"", but also stated footballers from outside the topflight could be of ""moderate risk"" on the basis of their social and other media profiles. We considered that categorisation also applied to retired footballers who had never played in the Premier League. We therefore assessed the appeal that Mr Akinfenwa was likely to have to under-18s on the basis of his social and media profiles. We understood that despite Mr Akinfenwa playing in the lower leagues of English football, he became well-known amongst football fans due to his impressive physical strength. That led to him being ranked as the strongest player in various editions of the FIFA videogame series and adopting the nickname The Beast. We noted that in 2022, his career was documented in an Amazon Prime documentary, titled Beast Mode On, which explored how he gained a following and a reputation for being an extremely strong football player. While we acknowledged BetUK’s view that Mr Akinfenwa’s clothing range BeastModeOn, had broad appeal and was not targeted at children, we considered the manner in which he was portrayed in the media and by which he had marketed himself would have led some football fans to view him as a cult hero in the game. We therefore considered that his media profile, alongside our view that he was unusually well known for a former lower league footballer, would have placed him in the “moderate risk” category of the guidance. In terms of his social media presence, we understood that Mr Akinfenwa had active public personal accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat. We noted that, through his YouTube channel, he often engaged with and published videos featuring well-known football related personalities. Although figures for under-18 followers on TikTok, Facebook, Twitter/X and YouTube were not available, of his 1.3 million Instagram followers, 8% were registered as under 18, which amounted to around 116,000 users. Of his 312,000 Snapchat followers, 13% were registered as under 18 years, which amounted to around 41,000 followers. Therefore, across his active social media accounts he had at least 157,000 followers who were under 18 years. The BCAP guidance stated, “… a generally high social media following that attracts a significant absolute number of under-18 followers, as determined through quantitative or qualitative analysis, is likely to be considered an indicator of 'strong' appeal”. We considered that over 157,000 followers aged under 18 years, with the true total figure likely higher due to the absence of data for the other social media platforms, was a significant number in absolute terms. Although his career as a lower league footballer and his media profile in isolation would have placed him in the “moderate risk” category, we considered that because he had such large numbers of social media followers who were under 18 years due to his career and profile, Mr Akinfenwa would be placed in the “high risk” category and was likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s. For that reason, we concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code.The ad breached BCAP Code (Edition 12) rules 17.4 and 17.4.5 (Gambling).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told LeoVegas Gaming plc t/a BetUK not to include a person or character who had strong appeal to those under 18 years of age in their advertising in future.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/leovegas-gaming-plc-a23-1214325-leovegas-gaming-plc.html
ASA Ruling on 6G Internet Ltd t/a 6Gi,,"A leaflet for 6Gi, a home broadband provider, seen on 29 September 2023, featured text on the front which stated “Fixed Wireless Broadband* Full Fibre Speed Broadband from £21.99 per month. Based on a 24-month contract”. The asterisk linked to small print at the bottom of the leaflet which stated “*6Gi broadband is delivered using fixed wireless and full fibre technologies. It is not provided over a mobile network and does not make use of 4G, 5G or future 6G cellular technologies”. Text on the back stated “100 Mbps download was £26.99 per month, now £21.99 per month. No gimmicks. Terms and conditions apply”.","The complainant, who believed the advertiser did not offer full fibre broadband with corresponding download speeds, challenged whether the claim “Full Fibre Speed Broadband” was misleading and could be substantiated.","6G Internet Ltd t/a 6Gi said the network over which they provided fixed wireless broadband services used both full fibre and fixed wireless technologies. They explained that the core and distribution networks were full fibre, in contrast to the local access networks, which used a wireless radio connection known as fixed wireless technology. That was a different wireless technology to those used in mobile networks. They said the wireless element covered a short distance, which was on average, a 500m distance between the fibre optic distribution network and a service address. They acknowledged the product itself was a fixed wireless broadband product and not a full fibre one. They believed consumers would understand the claim “Full Fibre Speed Broadband” to mean the speed of their advertised 100 Mbps fixed wireless broadband service delivered download speeds which were equivalent to full fibre download services. They said the inclusion of the phrase “Fixed Wireless Broadband”, which appeared prominently at the top of the ad, made it clear to consumers that the product was a fixed wireless broadband product and not a full fibre product. They said the inclusion of the word “speed” in the claim when read in conjunction with the phrase “Fixed Wireless Broadband” made that distinction clear. They believed both those phrases would have been read and considered by consumers together when viewing the ad, and that in any case, the most prominent text featured was the price claim. That was due, to their view, that the contrast between white text on a dark blue would be greater than green text on a dark blue background, because it was a greater contrast which made the text more prominent and improved readability. They added that small print at the bottom of the ad, which stated “6Gi broadband is delivered using fixed wireless and full fibre technology”, made that distinction further evident by outlining that a combination of technologies were used in providing the service and that mobile technologies were not used. They said their website provided additional details about the product and how the service was delivered to customers. 6Gi said although they could provide full fibre broadband, also known as fibre to the premises (FTTP), they did not advertise those services. When viewed in its entire context, they believed the ad clearly stated that the service on offer was fixed wireless broadband. Although 6Gi explained they offered a range of fixed wireless products with download speeds of up to 300 Mbps, they said the ad only related to the 100 Mbps package. They acknowledged that although 100 Mbps was at the lower end of what was considered full fibre speed, it was still within the required range to claim the product offered the same speed as full fibre broadband. They believed their product was therefore comparable to broadband services marketed as full fibre, such as BT’s full fibre 100 product. They said the ad was posted to homes in Blackburn as that was an area where their 100 Mbps product could be installed, and that, aside from unforeseen technical faults, that speed was guaranteed, and in some cases, even higher speeds were achieved. 6Gi said if a download speed of 100 Mbps could not be achieved when tested via a speed test during the installation process, they would not install the product. They had 789 customers on their network with a 100 Mbps package, of which 366 had joined in 2023. They provided a random sample of 49 of their customers from Blackburn who joined the network in that year. Data from that sample showed a speed of 100 Mbps was achieved for all customers at the point of installation. They said the average current speed across the sample was 115 Mbps, in which over 90% of customers received at least 100 Mbps speeds. They explained that the lower speeds were due to faults, rather than network limitations, which they were in the process of rectifying.","Upheld The ASA understood that the term full fibre, also known as fibre to the premises (FTTP), related to a product which supplied broadband directly to a home through fibre optic cables, whereas a fixed wireless broadband product used radio frequencies to transmit signals through the air without any wires or cables. We considered consumers were unlikely to know the technical differences between a fixed wireless broadband product and a ‘full’ fibre broadband product, but that they would have been aware of fibre services in general and associated them with newer technology and faster download speeds. Despite stating their core and distribution networks used fibre optic cables, 6Gi acknowledged their service was a fixed wireless product and not a full fibre one. We considered consumers were likely to interpret the headline claim “Full Fibre Speed Broadband”, within the context of the ad, to mean that the service being offered was a full fibre product which achieved download speeds and other service properties equivalent to other full fibre products. Due to the prominence of the larger text and different font colour used for that claim, we considered consumers would be drawn to it first when viewing the ad. Although we acknowledged 6Gi’s position that they were simply comparing the speed of their product to the speed of full fibre ones, we considered the initial impression consumers would have had from the ad was that the service being advertised was itself a full fibre product. Although we acknowledged that the ad also included the claim “Fixed Wireless Broadband”, which also appeared prominently, but was not presented in a stand-out colour, we considered its placement above the headline claim “Full Fibre Speed Broadband” likely created a significant degree of ambiguity for consumers when viewing the ad. We considered the small print, which stated “6Gi broadband is delivered using fixed wireless and full fibre technologies” did not sufficiently explain how the service worked and again implied that it was a full fibre product. The small print also stated “It is not provided over a mobile network and does not make use of 4G, 5G, or future 6G cellular technologies”, which we considered added to the impression that the service was not wireless and that, in some capacity, it utilised fibre to the premises FTTP technology. We acknowledged 6Gi provided data on a small sample of 49 customers, which showed a download speed of 100 Mbps was achieved for all those customers at the point of installation, and that 90% of those customers continued to achieve that speed. We understood that 100 Mbps was at the lower end of speeds typically delivered using full fibre broadband. Notwithstanding that, because we considered consumers were unlikely to interpret the claim “Full Fibre Speed Broadband” to mean the product was not full fibre but that it offered speeds equivalent to full fibre products, we considered that data was not relevant. For those reasons, we considered the ad gave the overall impression that the product being advertised was full fibre broadband. As that was not the case, we concluded the ad was likely to mislead consumers. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3, 3.4.1 (Misleading advertising), and 3.7 (Substantiation).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told 6G Internet Ltd t/a 6Gi to ensure future ads did not state or imply their service was a full fibre broadband product when that was not the case.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/6g-internet-ltd-a23-1213406-6g-internet-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on BPerfect Ltd,,"A TikTok video on Stephanie Vavron’s account and seen in November 2023 featured a video of Stephanie Vavron talking about her upcoming day and applying makeup. It began with her holding up a black BPerfect bag and she said, “Get ready with me using my BPerfect collab … I am in Glasgow and I am literally waiting to go into the Glasgow store … By the way Perfection primer is, everyone knows, my favourite. So a little bit of Perfection primer in champagne glow … and then I go in with my chroma … Anyway today I am a busy, busy girl. I got to film some content in BPerfect. I might actually do a live in BPerfect in the store. Like talking through some of the products and like, we will see what happens, we are kind of winging it today …” She was then shown holding a bottle of The Cheek, liquid blusher and said, “Now we are going on with The Cheek on my cheeks. This is also in my wee bundle …” She applied a spray to her face and said, “I have just set with this. This is in the box.”",The complainant challenged whether the ad was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication and whether its commercial intent was clear.,"BPerfect Ltd did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.Stephanie Vavron’s management said that the video had been made in response to a user’s comment and so it had not been planned or paid for. They explained that all the products being used in the video were incorporated organically. They said Stephanie Vavron did not receive any profits from the sale of the collaboration with BPerfect. The only exception was affiliate links, labelled on separate videos as “Commission paid”, where she would have received a percentage of sales through the TikTok shop.","The ASA was concerned by BPerfect’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and that they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. The video featured a number of BPerfect products and a BPerfect Cosmetics bag held by Stephanie Vavron. She described the BPerfect products in the video collectively as her, “BPerfect collab” and her “wee bundle”. The ASA noted Stephanie Vavron’s response that with the exception of affiliate links found in separate videos, she received no payment for the collaboration with BPerfect, including the specific video in the ad, which she had explained was posted with no editorial control from BPerfect. However, in the video Stephanie Vavron acknowledged she had collaborated with BPerfect, which was emphasised later in the video when she stated that she would be going to the Glasgow BPerfect store to discuss the products, and that meant she had a commercial relationship with the brand, who had not responded to contradict that position. We further understood that Stephanie Vavron had appeared on the BPerfect TikTok page discussing the bundle and it was described in the description of that video as, “Stephanie Vavron X BPerfect Bundle. This bundle is exclusive to our Glasgow store …” Therefore, because of that commercial relationship and that the content of the video was promoting BPerfect products, it was directly connected to the supply of goods; we concluded it was a marketing communication which fell within the ASA's remit. The Code stated that ads had to be identifiable as marketing communications and must be obviously identifiable as such. We considered the video to be insufficiently distinguishable from the rest of Stephanie Vavron’s TikTok content given that it lacked any clear content or context that made clear it was advertising. Further, although we noted that some of Stephanie Vavron’s followers would be aware of her collaboration with BPerfect and she did state in the video she had a “collab” with BPerfect, we considered that it was not sufficiently clear from that terminology and the video itself that she was promoting her own product with BPerfect. Therefore, it would not be clear to TikTok users, particularly to those new to TikTok, that the video concerned was a marketing communication. For these reasons, we considered the video was not obviously identifiable as a marketing communication and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told BPerfect Ltd and Stephanie Vavron to ensure that they made clear the commercial intent of their posts in future, for example by including a clear and prominent identifier on their social media posts such as #ad. We referred BPerfect Ltd to CAP’s compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/bperfect-ltd-a23-1218364-bperfect-ltd.html
"ASA Ruling on Banquist Ltd t/a Banquist, Winedrops",,"A paid for Facebook ad for Winedrops, a wine retailer, seen in January 2024, showed a woman holding a bottle of wine to her mouth. Text stated, “Save £100s every year….MASSIVE Wine Discounts”.","The complainant, who believed the ad encouraged drinking unwisely, challenged whether it was irresponsible.","Banquist Ltd t/a Winedrops said they were sorry if the ad had caused any discomfort. However, they did not believe it encouraged excessive drinking. They said the ad showed the woman sipping from the bottle, but did not indicate that she would finish it or drink to excess. They explained that they had included the image because it had been comical and relatable. They further stated that they did not believe offering discounts on premium wine encouraged excessive drinking. They explained that their products were premium ones and therefore did not target vulnerable people, in the same way that very cheap alcohol did.","Upheld Marketing communications must be socially responsible and must contain nothing that is likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that are unwise. For example, they should not encourage excessive drinking. The ASA noted the image of the woman holding a wine bottle and lifting it to her mouth to drink. We understood that wine generally was not drunk from the bottle, in part because a bottle contained approximately six servings and it was difficult to control how much was being drunk when drinking directly from the bottle. Therefore, the drinking style of the woman would have been interpreted as being associated with drinking quickly, excessively and without control. We further noted the multiple references to the wine being discounted and inexpensive. In isolation, advertised discounts on alcohol or references to the value of wine were not generally problematic. However, the references to cheap and massively discounted wine, alongside the image of someone drinking an almost full bottle of wine directly from the bottle, were likely to indicate, in combination, a drinking style that was excessive and lacked control. The ad therefore encouraged a drinking style that was unwise and was irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 18.1, 18.10 and 18.11 (Alcohol).",The ad must not appear in the same form again. We told Banquist Ltd t/a Winedrops that future ads should be socially responsible and not contain anything that was likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that were unwise.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/banquist-ltd-a24-1228136-banquist-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on OneCompress,,"Two paid-for Facebook ads for OneCompress, a company selling bamboo garments, seen on 20 December 2023: a. The first ad stated “*NEW Bamboo Arthritis Gloves that combat hand pains, arthritis, carpal tunnel, numbness and more while sleeping […]” and “WARNING: SLEEP WITH THESE AND FORGET ABOUT HAND PAIN […]”. The ad included a link to the advertiser’s website. b. The second ad stated “Combat foot neuropath pain without medicine… Fast-acting NEW Bamboo Anti-Fatigue Socks that combat foot pains, neuropathy, swelling, diabetic foot and more while sleeping […]” The ad included a link to the advertiser’s website.",The ASA challenged whether the ads made medical claims for unlicensed products.,OneCompress did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by OneCompress’ lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. Upheld The Medical Devices Regulations 2002 required that a medical device should be registered with The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) before it was placed on the market in Great Britain. The ASA understood that the products in ads (a) and (b) were not registered with the MHRA as medical devices. The CAP Code stated medicinal or medical claims and indications were made only for a medicinal product that was licensed by the MHRA, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. The ASA considered consumers would interpret the claims in ad (a) “combat hand pains, arthritis, carpal tunnel, numbness” and “sleep with these and forget about hand pain” as medical claims that the gloves could treat the symptoms and conditions listed. We considered consumers would interpret the claims in ad (b) “Combat foot neuropath pain” and “combat foot pains, neuropathy, swelling, diabetic foot” as medical claims that the socks could treat the symptoms and conditions listed. We therefore considered those claims were medical claims which therefore required that the products met the requirements for medical devices. However, as above, because we understood the products were not registered with the MHRA, nor had we seen any evidence that they had the applicable conformity marking, we therefore considered that no medical claims could be made for the products. Therefore, because the ads made medical claims, we concluded that they breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.10 (Legality) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told OneCompress not to make medical claims for products that did not have the applicable conformity marking and were not registered with the MHRA.

ASA Ruling on Simba Sleep Ltd,,"A website for Simba Sleep, www.simbasleep.com, seen on 26 July 2023 included several webpages for the “Simba Hybrid Mattress”, “Simba Hybrid Pro Mattress”, “Simba Hybrid Luxe Mattress” and the “Go Hybrid Mattress”. Each product page had a crossed-out price alongside a lower price in bold. The crossed-out reference price for the “Simba Hybrid Mattress” was £1,249. Next to it was a lower price in bold of £749.40. The crossed-out reference price for the “Simba Hybrid Pro Mattress” was £1,759. Next to it was a lower price in bold of £1,055.40. The crossed-out reference price for the “Simba Hybrid Luxe Mattress” was £2,409. Next to it was a lower price in bold of £1,445.40. The crossed-out reference price for the “Go Hybrid Mattress” was £2,399. Next to it was a lower price in bold of £1,439.40. Each product listing stated a savings claim of 40%.",Emma Matratzen GmbH challenged whether the crossed-out reference prices and associated savings claims were misleading.,"Simba Sleep Ltd said they had conducted a review of their promotional pricing strategy. They explained that they offered products at the relevant price for a period of time to establish that price as the genuine selling price. Simba Sleep provided sales data for the Simba Hybrid Mattress, Simba Hybrid Pro Mattress, Simba Hybrid Luxe Mattress and the Go Hybrid Mattress from 26 January 2023 to 26 July 2023. They said the pricing data for the first three mattresses in April and May 2023 were broken down into the three variants of the product; namely, the GRS, non-GRS and Stratos version, which related to the mattresses having cooling properties or an anti-allergenic mattress cover, which were new products that launched. Simba also said they were committed to complying with the CAP Code and had taken steps to amend their approach to future promotions.","Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand that the crossed-out prices represented the usual selling prices of the products at the time the ad was seen. We considered that they would understand the 40% savings claims to represent genuine savings against those usual selling prices. We understood that the price referenced for the Simba Go Mattress was in relation only to that mattress, and that the prices referenced in the ad for the Simba Hybrid Mattress, Simba Hybrid Pro Mattress and the Simba Hybrid Luxe mattress were for the GRS-versions of the products which were mattresses with an anti-allergenic cover. However, we considered it was not clear from the ad to which version of the mattress the price related. We assessed the sales data provided by Simba Sleep for the GRS-versions of the Simba Hybrid Mattress, Simba Hybrid Pro Mattress and the Simba Hybrid Luxe Mattress, since those were the versions of the mattresses that appeared in the ad, alongside the respective price claims. We also assessed the sales data for the Simba Go Mattress, which did not have multiple versions. We received pricing data for the GRS-versions of the Simba Hybrid Mattress and Simba Hybrid Pro Mattress, which covered a period of 97 days, and the GRS version of the Simba Hybrid Luxe Mattress which covered a period of 98 days. As the GRS-versions of the mattresses were introduced at different times, there was a slight discrepancy with the pricing periods for those mattresses. We were also provided with pricing data for the Simba Go Mattress, which covered a period of 182 days. Additionally, the data also showed the number of unit sales for each mattress at its promotional price and reference price. We then assessed the data provided to us. Both the GRS version of the Simba Hybrid Mattress and the Simba Hybrid Luxe, were sold at the reference price as quoted in the ad for 51 days each, and then at the discounted price (£749.40 and £1,445.40 respectively) for 51 days, over the pricing period. The GRS version of the Simba Hybrid Pro Mattress was sold at the reference price for 50 days, and at the discounted price of £1,055.40 for 51 days. The Simba Go Mattress was sold at the reference price for 74 days, and then at the discounted price of £1,439.40 for 106 days. The data showed that for all three of the GRS-versions of the mattresses, the prices fluctuated between the reference price and the promotional price for a period of seven days at a time. Starting from when the GRS-versions were introduced, they were sold at the promotional price for seven days, then at the higher reference price for seven days, returned to the promotional price for seven days, and was then sold at the higher reference price, which was repeated over the pricing period the data covered.We considered that two of the four mattresses - the Simba Hybrid Pro Mattress and the Simba Go Mattress - had been sold at the lower promotional price for longer than at the reference price quoted in the ad, and that Simba Sleep had therefore not established the higher price as the usual selling price of those mattresses. The other two mattresses - the Simba Hybrid Mattress and the Simba Hybrid Luxe Mattress - were both sold at the promotional price and the reference price for the same length of time (51 days each). Similarly, we considered Simba Sleep had not demonstrated that the reference price was the usual selling price of those mattresses. We also considered that the price fluctuations between the reference price and the promotional price, where it was sold at the reference price and the promotional price for seven days at a time, would likely affect consumers’ perceptions of the value of the offer, and whether the claimed saving was genuine. We next considered the number of unit sales for the four mattresses sold at the reference prices as quoted in the ad in comparison to the number sold at the promotional prices over the pricing period supplied for each mattress. The data showed 35 units of the Simba Hybrid Mattress were sold at the reference price and 1,283 units were sold at the promotional price. Of the Simba Hybrid Pro mattress 44 units were sold at the reference price and 1,516 units were sold at the promotional price. Whilst 46 units of the Simba Hybrid Luxe Mattress were sold at the reference price and 1,014 units were sold at the promotional price. Lastly, two units of the Simba Go Mattress were sold at the reference price and 18 units when at the promotional price. We considered that the unit sales data did not therefore demonstrate that there were significant sales at the higher selling price outside of the times the mattresses were sold at a promotional price, which was relevant in establishing whether the higher prices were the usual selling prices. Notwithstanding that, we understood that the GRS-versions of the three mattresses were only released in April and May 2023, and that they had not been sold before that. The CAP Code allowed marketers to sell products at introductory prices which were lower than the subsequent usual selling price. However, it had to be clear that the lower price was an introductory price, rather than a discount against a price that had been established as the current usual selling price. As referenced above, we considered that the data supplied was insufficient to demonstrate that the reference price was the usual selling price. Also, we further considered that the ad did not make clear that the lower price for the GRS-versions of the mattresses were introductory offers, rather than implying they were discounts against the usual selling price, which we considered was misleading and therefore a breach of the Code.Because consumers were likely to understand that the savings claims in the ad represented genuine savings against the usual selling prices of the products, and because the evidence did not substantiate the savings claims in the ad or demonstrate that the higher reference prices were the usual selling prices of the products, we concluded those reference prices and associated savings claims were misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (Prices).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Simba Sleep Ltd to ensure their future savings claims did not mislead and to ensure they substantiated savings claims against the usual selling price of their products.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/simba-sleep-ltd-a23-1200296-simba-sleep-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Vir Health Ltd t/a Numan,,"A TV ad for Regaine for Men Extra Strength Scalp Solution, a hair loss treatment, seen on 1 December 2022, featured a dialogue between two animated Action Man-type figures. The scene opened with one of them in a bathroom looking at his balding head in the mirror and saying despondently to himself, “Who are you kidding, mate? No-one cheats the passage of time.” The other figure, dressed as a soldier, suddenly appeared from behind the shower curtain and said to him, “The inaction ends now! Give me a chance to ask you to give Numan a chance to give you a chance to give your hair a chance to grow again!” The other figure asked, “What’s gone can be got back?” to which he replied, “It ain’t gone until it’s gone gone – and you ain’t gone gone! Do something about hair loss at Numan.com.” On-screen text stated “Regaine For Men Extra Strength Scalp Solution 5% w/v cutaneous solution is for hereditary hair loss in men. Contains minoxidil. Always read the label”. The soldier figure showed him a tablet device which appeared to show Numan’s website. Text on the website stated “Numan Hair Loss treatment. Clinically proven. Discreet delivery. Order now”. The soldier figure then said, “If your hair doesn’t grow back after 180 days of using Numan we’ll give you a full refund. Do something about hair loss at Numan.com.” He then spun a wheel with three segments: “STETSON”, “CAN OF POLISH” and “FULL REFUND”. The arrow landed on “FULL REFUND”. Further on-screen text stated “Refund if hair [sic] hasn’t stabilised/reversed in 180 days. T&Cs apply …”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad breached the Code by suggesting that the effects of Regaine For Men Extra Strength Scalp Solution were guaranteed.,"Vir Health Ltd t/a Numan explained that Regaine was a medicine used to treat common hereditary hair loss in men aged 18 to 65 years and contained the active ingredient minoxidil (5%). They said Clearcast had approved their evidence of clinical efficacy: a study which had found increased hair growth in the majority of participants. Numan believed it was extremely unlikely that viewers would understand from the ad that the effects were guaranteed. They considered that the wording of “Give me a chance to ask you to give Numan a chance to give your hair a chance to grow again” introduced an element of uncertainty that the treatment might or might not work on the person. The soldier character in the ad stated, “If your hair doesn’t grow back after 180 days of using Numan we’ll give a full refund”. Numan believed that did not imply a guarantee. Rather, it purposefully used cautious words to indicate to consumers that the treatment might not work for all participants and in that case, a consumer might receive a refund. Numan pointed out that in line with BCAP Code rule 11.23, they were permitted to offer refunds. Clearcast said after a previous version of the ad had been found by the ASA to breach the Code, they and Numan had worked together, using that ruling as a guide, to ensure that the revised ad complied with the Code. The ad was made up of two parts. The first, main part used language that made clear that the product was not suitable for all cases of hair loss; the dialogue emphasised that there was a “chance” as well as “what’s gone could be got back” and superimposed text stated the basis for the claim. “Clinically proven” appeared in the graphics only, in a section that was not linked to the refund. The second part was factual, related only to the refund, no longer pointed to effects being guaranteed and contained no efficacy claims. The setting and the characters’ clothes were different in the second part, disconnecting the refund section from the claims in the main part of the ad. Clearcast pointed out that in contrast to the previous Upheld version, the ad did not mention a guarantee, and simply stated that if users did not see results after 180 days they would get a refund. They believed the refund aspect was therefore simply factual and no longer pointed to effects being guaranteed.","Upheld The BCAP Code stated that no ad for a medicinal product may claim its effects were guaranteed. That did not prevent the offering of refunds, if the ad did not suggest that efficacy was guaranteed. The ad showed a balding character being encouraged to try the product. The ASA considered that in the context of an ad for hair loss, viewers would understand from the claims “If your hair doesn’t grow back after 180 days of using Numan we’ll give a full refund” and “Clinically proven” that the product was proven to show results within 180 days. The ad did not refer to a guarantee, and we acknowledged that the repeated use of the word “chance” and the question “What’s gone could be got back?” introduced an element of uncertainty. However, we considered that by emphasising the product’s effectiveness and by presenting the offer of a refund solely on the basis of the treatment’s performance, the ad was likely to give viewers the impression that the effects of the product were proven and guaranteed and that the refund related to seeing positive effects from the product in 180 days. For those reasons, we considered that in the context of the ad, the refund was likely to be interpreted as guaranteeing the efficacy of the product and we concluded that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP Code rule 11.23 (Medicines).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Vir Health Ltd t/a Numan not to refer to their refunds or money-back guarantees in a way that claimed or implied that efficacy of the product was guaranteed.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/vir-health-ltd-a22-1178070-vir-health-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Volkswagen Group United Kingdom Ltd t/a Audi,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on electric vehicle mileage ranges, identified for investigation following complaints received. See also related rulings published on 20 December.","A Video on Demand (VOD) ad for the Audi Q8 e-tron range, seen on ITVX on 19 April 2023. Voiceover in the ad stated, “Starting a new chapter can be the most thrilling thing in the world. There’s an abundance of reasons to get started.” On-screen text in the body of the ad stated, “Charge in approx. 31 minutes” as superimposed footnote text appeared “10-80%, 350kWh charger (limited in UK: motorways only, not available in NI, most of Sco/Wal). Test data for comparison – actual times vary (depending on e.g. spec, battery/charger condition & temp.). Longer in cold weather”. On-screen body text then stated, “330 miles maximum range” while superimposed footnote text stated, “Max range up to 330 miles (Official WLTP range for the Q8 55 e-tron quattro). May not reflect real life driving results. Model shown is not UK specification and features optional equipment”. The car dashboard was seen, where the ‘Range’ was shown to be 330 miles. The ad ended with on-screen text, “The new, fully electric Audi Q8 e-tron models”.","The complainant challenged whether the ad, which included the claims “Charge in approx. 31 minutes” and “330 miles maximum range”, was misleading.","Volkswagen Group United Kingdom Ltd t/a Audi explained that they liaised with Clearcast to ensure that the TV version of the ad, which was materially the same as the VOD ad, was suitable for broadcast in line with BCAP Code requirements. They said Clearcast had approved the claims, substantiation provided and the qualifying language, in terms of both content and prominence. Information on charging times and official mileage range was important to enable consumers to make an informed decision when considering the purchase of an electric vehicle and, in particular, when comparing different electric vehicles. In respect of the charging claim ""Charge in approx. 31 minutes"", Audi said the claim used conservative, rather than absolute, referencing ""approx. 31 minutes"". It was clearly caveated, with prominent footnote superimposed text (super) which explained the significant conditions and limitations of the claim. The super met the minimum height requirements, was held on screen for sufficient time, in line with Clearcast's 'duration of hold' calculator, and was present on screen in the same field of vision when the charging claim appeared. Audi were therefore very confident that the average consumer would understand the claim and its basis.Audi said the mileage range claim was determined by their factory testing which abided by Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) guidelines. They provided a document from a German motor authority, which stated that the highest maximum mileage in the Q8 e-tron range was for the Q8 55 e-tron and Q8 Sportback 55 e-tron at 390 miles, and the lowest maximum was for the Q8 50 e-tron and Q8 Sportback 50 e-tron at 326 miles. The lowest mileage for all six e-tron models was below 330 miles, and four out of the six models had a maximum above 330 miles. There were many variations of the Q8 e-tron, when you considered the different models and differing specifications, such as weight and tyres. Audi elected to be cautious and selected a maximum mileage range likely to cover a wider group of specifications. Audi explained that their factory testing showed that the charge time for the Q8 55 e-tron was 31 minutes when charging from 10% to 80% using a 170 kW charging system. They said it was common practice to provide figures for charging from 10% to 80%, given that charging within these limits was most efficient and best practice to preserve the battery. The testing carried out by Audi was an internal test, but followed the test procedures set by the German standard. Audi provided further information which demonstrated that their testing followed the guidelines stipulated by the German standard and the result was that the charge time for the Q8 55 e-tron from 10% to 80% was 31 minutes. They pointed out that space and time in the ad was limited and believed further explanatory wording in addition to existing requirements was unviable. Audi did not believe viewers would understand the ad to mean that the 330-mile range would be achievable on a charge taking 31 minutes (i.e., a charge of 80%). They believed it was clear that the charge and the mileage range claims were two separate claims, advertising different aspects of the vehicle. There was a clear two-second gap between the charge claim being on-screen and the mileage range claim appearing. Each claim had its own, separate on-screen explanation and there was nothing which linked the two claims. Instead, they were presented, as is common practice in automotive advertising, as a list of (distinct) attributes of the model range. The charge claim was clearly presented as relating to 10-80%. The ""330 miles"" range was clearly stated to be the maximum both in the claim itself (i.e., ""330 miles maximum range"") and in the on-screen text (""Max range up to 330 miles …""). Based on this, Audi was confident that the average consumer would be aware that the 31-minute charging time related to a charge of 10-80% and that 330 miles was the maximum range. They did not believe it likely that the average consumer would interpret the ""maximum"" mileage to be achievable on 80% charge. Audi believed the average consumer would understand that there was a clear distinction between the mileage and vehicle range claims, since there was a significant time period between the two. The average consumer would read the mileage range claim in the context of the information on-screen at the time the claim was made, including the prominent footnote, and would therefore understand that it related to the car stated, i.e., the Q8 55 e-tron Quattro. Regardless of the above, however, Audi explained that the text ""330 miles maximum range"", as further qualified by the superimposed text ""Max. range up to 330 miles"", was substantiated for the Q8 e-tron models. While two out of six e-tron models had a maximum mileage range of 326 miles, four miles below the 330 mile range, this was accommodated for by the ""up to"" in the on-screen footnote. Audi told us they were confident that a maximum range of ""up to"" 330 miles could be substantiated and was not misleading. Clearcast believed the ‘31-minute charge’ and the ‘330-mile range’ claims were clearly distinct. They were not directly linked to each other to create a combined mileage range and charging time claim. Both claims had their own qualifying text, and from their positioning, viewers were unlikely to think that they were linked. Clearcast further explained that the term “WLTP” had been used widely in broadcast advertising since 2017 and exclusively since 2020 for any range, CO2 emission, or fuel consumption claims. Even if a viewer was unfamiliar with the term, they would understand by the text “may not reflect real life driving results” that the WLTP figure was based on testing criteria conducted in a lab. That could reasonably have meant that the battery capacity at test was one variable, along with others, such as driving conditions or temperature.","Upheld The ad opened with a narrative about “starting a new chapter”. It stated, “There’s an abundance of reasons to get started”. It first showed the prominent claim “Charge in approx. 31 minutes”, followed by a second prominent claim “330 miles maximum range”, and then the third prominent claim “The new, fully electric Audi Q8 e-tron models”. We considered that the ad was targeted towards viewers who were considering entering the electric vehicle market and gave some key capabilities to help with that – charging time and mileage range. While we acknowledged that there was a two-second gap between both the charge and mileage claims, and each was accompanied by a qualifying super, the more prominent claims appeared on the same space on screen successively. We considered that those prominent pointers gave the impression that the vehicle range could achieve a maximum mileage of 330 miles, and that this could be achieved following a charge taking 31 minutes. Qualifying text, therefore, would be expected to reinforce that message. The test data provided by Audi showed that the Audi Q8 e-tron models could be charged from 10% to 80% in 31 minutes with the appropriate charger, as stated in the super. We understood that this percentage range was the advised minimum and maximum charge in order to preserve the health of the battery. However, the super supporting the mileage claim stated it was based on WLTP testing. WLTP procedure involved a testing process for measuring the fuel economy electric mileage range, and emissions of new cars. It began at a battery charged to 100% and was intended as a guide for comparison only. This information was not conveyed. A significant number of viewers would not be aware of the term “WLTP” or what it represented. We acknowledged the use of “maximum” in the mileage claim. However, this was likely to be understood as the maximum mileage achievable by the vehicle as driven by consumers (“330 mi” was stated on the car dashboard in the ad) and on an advisable amount of charge. We further understood that several Q8 e-tron models could not achieve the advertised 330 maximum mileage, according to WLTP testing. Superimposed text stated that the maximum range quoted referred to the Q8 55 e-tron quattro, and therefore referenced an individual model. We acknowledged Audi’s comment that the charging and mileage range claims were distinct and likely to be understood in the context of the superimposed information on-screen at the time the relevant claim was made. However, the superimposed text did not support the message conveyed by the more prominent text; that the vehicle range could achieve a maximum mileage of 330 miles, and that this could be achieved following a charge taking 31 minutes. We considered that the overall message of the ad was rendered ambiguous and concluded, therefore, that it was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Volkswagen Group United Kingdom Ltd t/a Audi to ensure that future ads for electric vehicles avoided ambiguity relating to charging time or mileage performance that was likely to mislead.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/volkswagen-group-united-kingdom-ltd-a23-1195221-volkswagen-group-united-kingdom-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Brown-Forman Beverages Europe Ltd t/a Jack Daniel's,,"A poster for Jack Daniel’s, seen on the London Underground on 16 November 2023. The ad featured a group of friends sat around a table, two of whom were pouring Jack Daniel’s and a mixer into one glass, whilst others were seen holding glasses of Jack Daniel’s. Large text stated “Shorter days mean we can skip to the good part.” Text at the bottom of the poster stated “Jack Daniel’s: Make it count.” and further text underneath that stated “Remember the good parts. Please drink responsibly”.","The complainant challenged whether the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code because it promoted adopting drinking styles that were unwise, implied that alcohol might take priority in life, and implied that drinking alcohol could overcome boredom by encouraging people to start drinking earlier in the day.","Brown-Forman Beverages Europe Ltd t/a Jack Daniel's said the ad formed part of a campaign which sought to depict groups of people in different scenarios, making the most out of everyday life. They highlighted the fact that the ad portrayed a social occasion amongst friends and that the alcoholic drinks featured in the ad were not excessive in number or size. As such, they did not believe the ad suggested the individuals were engaging in drinking styles that were irresponsible or excessive. Jack Daniel's said the text “Shorter days mean we can skip to the good part” was a reference to spending time with friends, as demonstrated by the ad. They also said that, as daylight hours decreased, there was a feeling that it became the evening earlier on in the day. In turn, they believed that an individual’s working day was over sooner, which allowed more time to socialise with friends. They explained the text “Remember the good parts. Please drink responsibly” was intended to inform consumers about the importance of responsible drinking, and that because overconsumption could lead to memory loss, they should not overconsume the product. Global said they had not received any complaints about the ad. They confirmed that the ad had been removed from the London Underground network.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications for alcohol must be socially responsible and must not contain anything that was likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that were unwise. It also required marketing communications not to imply that alcohol might take priority in life or that drinking alcohol could overcome boredom. The ad depicted a group of people sitting around a table socialising and featured several alcoholic drinks. The ASA considered the focus of the ad was on the alcohol present with the centre of the image being two individuals who were pouring Jack Daniel’s and mixer into a glass. We considered that was further emphasised by other individuals who were seen holding glasses of Jack Daniel’s, including a large image of a hand holding a glass in the foreground, and a large image of a bottle of Jack Daniel’s at the bottom of the ad. The ad stated “shorter days mean we can skip to the good part”, and we considered that “shorter days” referred to the end of British Summer Time and a return to Greenwich Mean Time, which means there were fewer hours of daylight and sunset was earlier in the day. We also considered that consumers were likely to understand “the good part” to refer to drinking alcohol, and in particular Jack Daniel’s. By suggesting that “shorter days” meant consumers could “skip to the good part” of the day - in other words, the evening when it was socially acceptable for consumers to drink alcohol - the ad implied that the rest of the day was mundane and a period of time to be endured. We considered “the good part” was likely to be seen as a part of the day to be given a higher priority, and that drinking alcohol could overcome the boredom of the rest of the day. Furthermore, because the ad encouraged people to start drinking earlier than they would at other times of the year, we considered that it encouraged people to consume more alcohol than they usually would. We acknowledged that the ad stated “Remember the good parts. Please drink responsibly”. However, we considered the further reference to “good parts” reinforced the impression that drinking alcohol was the most enjoyable part of the day and that it therefore took priority in life. We also considered the drink responsibly message did not change the impression of the ad. Because the ad implied that drinking alcohol could overcome boredom and encouraged people to start drinking earlier than usual, we considered the ad implied that alcohol might take priority in life and that it promoted adopted drinking styles which were unwise. As such, we concluded the ad was irresponsible and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 18.1 and 18.6 (Alcohol).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Capital Credit Union Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on social responsibility in ads for loans offered for Christmas, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related ruling published on 28 February 2024.","A paid-for Meta ad for Capital Credit Union, seen on 14 November 2023, featured text which stated “With a hassle-free Christmas Loan, you can take the stress out of Christmas. Cherish every moment of the holidays, without fretting over your budget, by taking advantage of an affordable loan”. Text below stated “[Father Christmas emoji] Loans from 6.9% to 26.8% APR*. [Father Christmas emoji] Borrow from as little as £50 [Father Christmas emoji] Repay from 3 months to 10 years*”. Underneath was an image of someone wearing Christmas socks with their feet put up beside a hot drink and text that stated TAKE THE STRESS OUT OF THE FESTIVE SEASON WITH A HASSLE-FREE CHRISTMAS LOAN” with an “Apply Now” call to action button below.",The ASA challenged whether the ad irresponsibly encouraged consumers to spend more than they could afford by taking out a loan to fund Christmas spending.,"Capital Credit Union Ltd said they immediately removed the ad from circulation on receiving notification of the ASA's investigation and they had reviewed their other ads. They said credit unions were not-for-profit co-operatives that were capped by law in what they could charge their members in relation to loan rates, so they did not fall into the category of high-cost lenders. A considerable number of their members were living on benefits and many would also be classed as ‘working poor’. They offered access to low cost, affordable loans to help them build financial resilience. Capital Credit Union said there was inevitably a pressure on all households during the festive period. That would be felt even more acutely by those who had the fewest financial options, because they were not considered credit worthy by the mainstream banks and were restricted in who they could reach out to for support. For many of their members, the only way they could have a Christmas was by borrowing a small amount from a credit union. The use of the term “hassle-free” was to acknowledge that loan applications to the credit union were simple and those applying would not be stressed by the application process, which was a common issue for those with poor credit ratings. Doorstep, payday and illegal lenders were attractive because of the ease and speed at which people could apply for, and receive funds, but were not in their best interests. Credit unions therefore needed to send strong messages that their credit services were “hassle-free"". When people borrowed from a credit union, they also had access to savings accounts, other types of lending and financial education. Their loans helped people rebuild their credit history and made it easier to access affordable loans in the future. The alternatives would be high-cost lenders, payday lenders and predatory and illegal lenders, which could have the most detrimental impact on the financially vulnerable. They did not believe the ad was irresponsible and they took seriously their role in providing a social service to those who had the fewest financial choices and worked closely with partners such as Fair 4 All Finance, the Department for Work and Pensions and both Westminster and Scottish governments.","Upheld The ASA acknowledged that credit unions were often the only option of financial assistance for many consumers who would not be considered creditworthy by mainstream banks and who might otherwise turn to high-cost or illegal money lenders to obtain credit. We also understood that credit unions provided services which helped their members build their credit rating. However, as with any credit provider, consumers would be required to repay what they had borrowed, with interest, and there would be consequences if repayments were not made on time. The ad promoted Capital Credit Union’s Christmas loan and we therefore focused our assessment on whether the ad presented that product responsibly. We acknowledged Christmas was a time when people did need extra money to cover additional costs such as buying gifts, extra food to celebrate Christmas Day or travel expenses incurred by visiting family. We also acknowledged that the ad included information about the range of loan interest rates, repayment durations and the minimum amount that could be borrowed. The ad featured the claims “With a hassle-free Christmas Loan, you can take the stress out of Christmas” and “TAKE THE STRESS OUT OF THE FESTIVE SEASON WITH A HASSLE-FREE CHRISTMAS LOAN”. We noted Capital Credit Union's comment that the claim ""hassle-free"" was intended as a reference to the loan application process. However, we considered that the claims implied that taking out Capital Credit Union’s Christmas loan could make celebrating Christmas stress-free because it was an easy and hassle-free way to obtain additional funds to spend during the festive season. The ad also stated, “Cherish every moment of the holidays, without fretting over your budget” and featured an image of a person with their feet put up, relaxing with a hot drink. We considered that reinforced the impression that by taking out a Christmas loan, consumers would be able to avoid any of the financial worry associated with Christmas. They could also spend more than they would otherwise be able to afford, without the need to stick to a budget. We considered that the combination of the claims and imagery made light of the decision to take on a debt and encouraged consumers to use a loan to overspend at Christmas. We acknowledged that Capital Credit Union said the ad had been withdrawn. However, for the reasons stated, we concluded that the ad encouraged the taking out of a loan to fund Christmas spending in a way that was irresponsible, and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Responsible advertising).","The ad must not appear again the form complained of. We told Capital Credit Union Ltd to ensure that future ads did not irresponsibly encourage excessive spending through the use of credit, particularly in relation to Christmas spending.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/capital-credit-union-ltd-a23-1224909-capital-credit-union-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Lenovo Technology (UK) Ltd,,"An email from Lenovo Technology, seen on 28 September 2023, featured text which stated “You're in the know. Insiders get first access to email exclusive deals, product releases, and Lenovo news. Get 10% off any product”. A coupon code and a link to the advertiser’s website were both below the text. At the bottom of the email, small print stated “See the website for eCoupon terms and conditions. eCoupon does not apply to certain products and is non-stackable”.","The complainant, who had a background in consumer journalism and who understood that some products were excluded from the promotion, challenged whether the claim “Get 10% off any product” was misleading.","Lenovo Technology (UK) Ltd acknowledged the complaint, but did not provide a substantive response to the ASA’s enquiries.","Upheld The ASA was concerned by Lenovo Technology (UK) Ltd’s lack of substantive response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a substantive response to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. We considered that consumers would interpret the claim “Get 10% off any product”, to mean that all products on the Lenovo Technology website were included in the promotion and would therefore be discounted by 10% by entering a coupon code. We acknowledged small print at the bottom of the ad stated “eCoupon does not apply to certain products and is non-stackable”. That information, however, was presented in relatively small text at the very bottom of the ad and had not been linked to the “Get 10% off any product” claim by way of an asterisk. Notwithstanding that, we considered that even if some consumers had seen the qualification, it was not sufficient to counter the overriding impression of the ad that all products would be discounted by 10%. Because consumers were likely to interpret the claim “Get 10% off any product” to mean all products were discounted by 10% when in fact certain ones were excluded, we concluded that the claim was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.9 (Qualification).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

Our Christmas Loan is here to spread the holiday cheer and help you create lasting memories with your loved ones [gift and celebration emojis]”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad irresponsibly encouraged consumers to spend more than they could afford by taking out a loan to fund Christmas spending.,"Pennine Community Credit Union Ltd t/a PCCU said their objectives were to help their members improve their long-term financial health and give them access to affordable credit. Credit unions were often the ‘lender of last resort’ and in many cases prevented people from accessing high-cost credit or succumbing to illegal money lenders that could have a longer and more detrimental impact on people’s financial circumstances. They were only able to offer credit at or under their statutory interest rate cap of 3% per month and although they were not covered by consumer credit regulation, they acknowledged that they still had an ethical obligation to lend responsibly and to follow the consumer credit regulation as guidance. Many households, especially those on a low income, would need a line of credit to help spread the cost of their expenditure for Christmas over the year. Christmas was a stressful period, where there was increased risk of people turning to high-cost credit options to ease their financial pressures. They offered a variety of free to open savings accounts, including a ‘Christmas club’. By joining PCCU, people could get not only an affordable loan to spread the cost of Christmas, but also be prepared for the next year’s festive period and extra expenses throughout the year. In reference to the current cost of living crisis, they believed it was important that affordable lending was marketed to those who needed it most. Many of their members were financially vulnerable so an “unforgettable Christmas” could mean being able to afford one present for a loved one or covering the additional food spend to have a Christmas dinner. They did not believe that the images in the ad were lavish or encouraged overspending and did not target any vulnerable customer groups.","Upheld The ASA acknowledged that credit unions were often the only option of financial assistance for many consumers who would not be considered creditworthy by mainstream banks and who might otherwise turn to high-cost or illegal money lenders to obtain credit.

ASA Ruling on Space NK Ltd t/a Space.NK,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld","An Instagram post on cosmetics company Space NK’s own account, seen on 13 September 2023, featured a video that demonstrated their 2023 beauty advent calendar. A caption below the video stated “A COMPETITION YOU’LL WANT TO ENTER! WIN The 2023 Space NK Beauty Advent Calendar […] to enter all you need to do is Follow Space NK; Comment a [present emoji]; Tag 3 Friends; Get 0 Likes on your comment; Share to your stories for TWO bonus entries”.","The complainant, who believed that not all entrants were included in the ‘final draw’ and so did not have an equal chance of winning, challenged whether: 1. the prize was awarded in accordance with the laws of chance; and 2. the promotion was administered fairly. The ASA challenged whether: 3. the ad breached the Code because it omitted the significant conditions of the promotion.","1. & 2. Space NK Ltd said the prize draw closed at 6 pm on 15 September 2023, and that in their view adequate time had been allocated to collate entries and to determine the winner. They said there was no limit to the number of times a participant could enter by commenting on the post, but they could only earn one entry through commenting, and that any additional entries had to be earnt by a participant sharing the post on their Instagram story. To select the winner, their social media manager manually reviewed all comments on the post and shortlisted the usernames of those posters that met the entry requirements, including whether they had commented a present emoji, tagged three users, received zero likes on their comment, and followed the Space NK Instagram account. They then checked whether those entrants had earnt two bonus entries by navigating to the direct message section of their profile. Space NK said that from there it was possible to see, for both public and private Instagram accounts, when the user had last mentioned SpaceNK in their Instagram story, and that was visible once the story had expired after 24 hours. They said all participants who had mentioned Space NK in their Instagram Story received the two bonus entries. After the shortlist of entrants had been established, the names were added to an online random name generator, and a winner was selected and then notified. 3. Space NK said that all relevant significant conditions of the promotion were included in the post and consumers would understand from the text “terms and conditions apply” that the full terms and conditions could be found on Space NK’s website. They said future promotions would make that explicit and highlight that a link to their website could be found on their Instagram Bio.","1. & 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that promoters must conduct their promotions equitably, promptly and efficiently and be seen to deal fairly and honourably with participants and potential participants. Promoters of prize draws must ensure that prizes were awarded in accordance with the laws of chance and, unless winners were selected by a computer process that produced verifiably random results, by an independent person, or under the supervision of an independent person. Additionally, promoters must avoid causing unnecessary disappointment and should not give consumers justifiable grounds for complaint. There were multiple criteria which entrants had to fulfil to enter into the prize draw: “Follow” Space NK’s Instagram account; “Comment” a present emoji; “Tag” three friends; and their comment had to receive zero “Likes”. The promotion also allowed entrants to qualify for two bonus entries by sharing the promotional post as an Instagram story. The ASA understood Space NK had manually reviewed the post’s comments and bonus entries. The usernames of the participants who had made valid entries were then placed into a piece of online software that randomly selected a winner. We understood that this process had produced verifiably random results. However, Space NK had not provided evidence that demonstrated all valid entries at the time the promotion closed had been included before the manual review began. They had also not demonstrated the review had excluded entries that were liked after the prize draw closed but before the list of valid entries was compiled. In relation to bonus entries, Space NK demonstrated that they could see when a public or private Instagram account had mentioned them in an Instagram story, including after the story post had expired. However, they were unable to see the content of the story and whether the promotional post itself had actually been shared. We understood that meant Space NK could only review whether a private account had mentioned them in a story post, rather than if they had shared the promotional post itself. That meant two bonus entries could have then been awarded to participants who had not necessarily met the full requirements for them. We considered that meant invalid entries could have been included in the draw. For an entry into the draw to be valid, it had to accrue zero Likes from other Instagram users at the time the prize draw closed; participants or other Instagram users would have been able to Like a participant’s entry to disqualify it. By liking another’s comment, participants would have increased their chances of winning. However, Space NK had a responsibility to ensure that mechanic was not abused, for example, by ensuring that a situation did not emerge where all entries had been liked at the draw’s closing time and they could not award a prize. We were not presented with evidence that detailed Space NK had policies in place to prevent abuse. Notwithstanding that, Space NK were able to demonstrate the final winner was selected via a piece of online software that produced a verifiably random result. They had not demonstrated, however, that all valid entries were included in the final draw, and that invalid entries had been excluded. Furthermore, we had not seen evidence that outlined there were terms in place to prevent the zero Likes component of the promotion being abused. We therefore concluded the promotion had not been administered fairly and breached the Code. On those points, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.2 (Promotional marketing), 8.14 (Administration), and 8.24 (Prize promotions). 3. Upheld The CAP Code stated that promotions must communicate all applicable significant conditions or information where the omission of such conditions or information was likely to mislead. Significant conditions may, depending on the circumstances, include: the start and closing date of the promotion; that it was open to UK residents only: and that participants could make more than one entry. We understood the promotion ran for 48 hours after the ad was posted on 13 September 2023, closing at 6 pm on 15 September 2023, and participants could make more than one entry into the draw via the promotional post’s comment section. However, the post did not state the specific time the draw started, or the specific closing time. Additionally, the post did not state that participants could make more than one entry into the draw by posting more than one comment. We considered those were significant conditions which were likely to affect consumers’ understanding of the promotion and their decision to participate. We therefore considered their omission was likely to mislead. While the ad stated “T&Cs Apply”, it did not explicitly outline where participants or potential participants could access the conditions of the promotion. We welcomed Space NK’s assurance that they would put a hyperlink to the terms and conditions in their Instagram Bio section, and signpost where the link could be found in their ad. However, we considered that the significant conditions and the link to the full terms and conditions would need to be included in the post itself for future promotions. As the ad had omitted significant conditions, we therefore concluded the promotion breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.17, 8.17.1, 8.17.3, and 8.17.4 (Significant conditions for promotions).",The promotion must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Strafe Esports Ltd t/a LevelTap,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for ad on Facebook for LevelTap, a gaming company, seen on 6 December 2023, featured an image of a man driving in a racing simulator. Text on the image stated “DRINK DRIVER PACKAGE. £50PP. 30MIN WELCOME BEER / PROSECCO + INTRO” and “Revamp your party experience!”. A caption on the post stated “Bored of the same old parties? We’ve got party packages for everyone! Book now – don’t miss out”.","Two complainants, who believed the ad trivialised and encouraged drink driving, challenged whether it: 1. linked alcohol with an activity in which drinking would be unsafe or unwise; and 2. was irresponsible.","1. & 2. Strafe Esports Ltd t/a LevelTap said it was not their intention to trivialise or encourage drink driving. They believed the ad clearly promoted a racing simulator gaming package, which involved customers playing a video game whilst enjoying food and alcoholic drinks. They said it was never their intention to promote or encourage drink driving. However, they acknowledged the phrase “drink driver package” could have been interpreted by some consumers as trivialising or encouraging drink driving. They said they had amended the ad by replacing the phrase “drink driver package” with the phrase “tipsy racer package”, which they believed made it clear the ad referred to a racing simulator game.","1. & 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be socially responsible and must not link alcohol with activities or locations in which drinking would be unsafe or unwise, including driving. The ad featured an image of a person driving a vehicle which resembled a Formula One car, alongside text which stated “drink driver package”. There were also references to beer and prosecco. Although further text stated the service on offer was a “grand prix”, and the driver was wearing a headset, there was no additional information to instantly clarify whether that game involved virtual or real driving. Whilst we understood the vehicle was a racing simulator game and therefore not real-life driving, we considered there was nothing in the ad which made it immediately clear that it was a videogame. We therefore considered there was a clear link in the ad between alcohol and driving, which was an activity in which drinking was unsafe or unwise. We also considered the phrases “bored of the same old parties” and “revamp your party experience”, within the context of an ad which referred to “drink driving” without making it explicitly clear the product was a video game, trivialised and encouraged drink driving and was therefore irresponsible. We welcomed LevelTap’s willingness to amend the ad. However, we considered replacing the phrase “drink driver package” with “tipsy racer package” did not sufficiently change the messaging of the ad. In addition to continuing to link alcohol with driving, it also linked alcohol with racing, which was associated with dangerously high speeds. The reference to “tipsy” also suggested that drivers would be feeling the effects of the alcohol and would be mildly drunk whilst driving. We considered that the amended ad therefore breached the Code by linking alcohol to driving and was irresponsible by making light of driving while mildly intoxicated from drinking alcohol. For those reasons, we concluded the ad linked alcohol with an activity in which drinking would be unsafe or unwise, trivialised and encouraged drink driving and was therefore irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 18.1 and 18.12 (Alcohol).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

GMRD Apps Ltd t/a Impulse Brain Training stated they did not believe the Impulse Brain Training app was categorised as a medical device and that the ADHD test promoted in the ad was not intended for the diagnosis of ADHD, but for information and educational purposes only. They highlighted the ADHD types referenced in the ad were not recognised as official symptoms of ADHD as recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO), and that therefore the ad did not diagnose specific types of ADHD. They further stated that the app did not make any medical claims or provide a medical diagnosis and that they had included a disclaimer before users took the test to encourage them to seek professional help if they suspected any health problems. Impulse Brain Training stated the app did not offer treatment for ADHD, but that the test was intended to raise awareness of the condition and provide information to users that may be experiencing attention-related problems. They also said they were working with an American university to license an 18-part self-reporting questionnaire to enhance the accuracy and reliability of their assessment.","1. Upheld The Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) required that a medical device was registered with them before it was placed on the market in the UK. The ASA understood that the product was not registered with the MHRA as a medical device. The CAP Code stated that medicinal or medical claims and indications could be made only for a medicinal product that was licensed by the MHRA, the Veterinary Medicines Regulations (VMD) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. Text in the ad stated “What’s your ADHD type?”, beneath which were listed a number of different types of ADHD, such as “Anxious” and “Over Focused”, as well as “ADHD free”. We understood the types referenced were not official categories of ADHD, as recognised by the WHO. However, as the ad stated “TAKE TEST” and one of the types referenced was “ADHD free”, we considered the ad implied that by using the app and taking the test, users could find out if they had ADHD or not. We therefore considered the ad implied it could diagnose ADHD. As this was a medical claim, it therefore required that the product met the requirements for medical devices. However, because we understood the product was not registered with the MHRA, nor had we seen any evidence that the Impulse Brain Training app had the applicable conformity marking, we considered that no medical claims could be made for the product. Therefore, because the ad made medical claims, we concluded it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.10 (Legality) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketers must not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical conditions should be sought. Advertisers must not offer specific advice on diagnosis of or treatment for such conditions, unless that advice, diagnosis or treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. As discussed above, we considered the ad implied that the Impulse Brain Training app could diagnose ADHD via an assessment. We considered that ADHD was a condition for which medical supervision should be sought, and therefore advice, diagnosis or treatment should be conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. However, we did not receive evidence to show that diagnosis for those with ADHD using the Impulse Brain Training app was carried out under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. We acknowledged that the test contained a disclaimer before users took the test. However, we considered that the ad itself did not contain a disclaimer, and in any case a disclaimer did not negate Impulse Brain Training’s responsibilities to demonstrate that the diagnosis of ADHD was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified professional. We considered that, in the absence of such a professional, because the ad implied it could diagnose ADHD, it therefore discouraged consumers from seeking essential treatment for a condition for which medical supervision should be sought, and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.2 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told GMRD Apps Ltd t/a Impulse Brain Training not to make medical claims for products that did not have the applicable conformity marking and were not registered with the MHRA.

ASA Ruling on Happyo,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad for Happyo, a behaviour programme aimed at those with ADHD, seen on 29 September 2023, featured a video. The voice-over said, “I just can’t focus. Sounds familiar? This is how I solved it. For one, it made it difficult to complete tasks; I would start something but then get easily distracted and lose track of what I was doing.” The video showed different people doing different tasks including studying, typing on a laptop and folding a towel. The voice-over further said, “Here comes Happyo! This programme helps me to build healthy habits and understand how my ADHD brain works. Manage your ADHD with Happyo. Take the test.” The video then showed the Happyo website and a person answering different questions. The caption stated “Are you ready to unlock the hidden superpowers of your ADHD brain?” Further text stated “ADHD management is a journey rather than a quick fix. Happyo has a ton of CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) approaches, common lessons, and soothing activities as a result. Learn to manage ADHD today”.",The ASA challenged whether: 1. the medical claims breached the Code; and 2. the ad discouraged essential treatment for a condition for which medical supervision should be sought.,1. & 2. Happyo said they had removed the ad in response to the complaint and provided evidence that it had been withdrawn.,"1. Upheld The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) required that a medical device was registered with them before it was placed on the market in the UK. The ASA understood that the product was not registered with the MHRA as a medical device. The CAP Code stated that medicinal or medical claims and indications could be made only for a medicinal product that was licensed by the MHRA, the Veterinary Medicines Regulations (VMD) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. The voice-over in the ad talked about their experience of ADHD before and after using Happyo. They said, “For one, it made it difficult to complete tasks; I would start something but then get easily distracted and lose track of what I was doing”, and “This programme helps me to build healthy habits and understand how my ADHD brain works. Manage your ADHD with Happyo.” We considered those statements implied that the app helped to manage and reduce certain symptoms of ADHD and increase their productivity, thereby alleviating the symptoms of the condition. We noted that the voice-over also referred to solving their ADHD, which we considered consumers would understand to mean that the individual’s ADHD no longer affected them after using Happyo and, therefore, that the app helped to treat the condition. Text in the caption stated “ADHD management is a journey rather than a quick fix. Happyo has a ton of CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) approaches, common lessons, and soothing activities as a result. Learn to manage ADHD today”. Because the text referred to treatment and techniques to manage ADHD, we considered that furthered the impression that the product could treat those with the condition. The caption also stated “Take the test”, which we considered consumers would interpret to mean that the app could diagnose ADHD. Those statements therefore were considered to be medical claims and required that the product met the requirements for medical devices. However, because we understood the Happyo program was not registered with the MHRA, nor had we seen any evidence that the website had the applicable conformity marking, we considered that no medical claims could be made for the product. We welcomed Happyo’s action in removing the ad. However, because at the time the ad was seen it made medical claims, we concluded it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.10 (Legality) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 2.

ASA Ruling on Rebecca Louise t/a rebeccalouise95,,"A poster, seen in October and November 2023, featured an image of the top half of model and influencer Rebecca Louise. She was wearing a shiny red bra top which had several straps and buckles. Alongside the image was the logo of the OnlyFans social media platform and the text “onlyfans.com/rebeccalouise95”. The poster also featured the Instagram logo and the text “@RebeccaLouisex95”.","Two complainants, who understood that OnlyFans was an internet content subscription service which featured sexual adult content, challenged whether the ad was inappropriate for display in an untargeted medium.","Rebecca Louise said she had developed the ad with careful consideration for potential audiences. She believed it adhered to established advertising guidelines and reflected trends observed in leading brands. She believed that the image used was not suggestive or harmful, and was less provocative than mainstream ads for lingerie or perfume in outdoor media. She pointed out that the ad had appeared for eight weeks, but had attracted only a small number of complaints. She said the ad deliberately omitted any call to action or explicit information about its subject matter, in order to conceal the nature of the OnlyFans platform from those who might not be aware of it, as well as those who did not wish to engage with it. The OnlyFans logo did appear in mainstream media, where it was associated with high-profile sporting personalities and was not subject to scheduling or targeting restrictions. The ad was placed with consideration to child safety and not in the vicinity of schools. Ms Louise believed the ad would not appeal to children because it did not feature bright colours, engaging slogans, fun elements or QR codes. She said her audience on social media channels was primarily in the 25-44 age bracket, with 65.6% of all followers falling into that category. She said the OnlyFans website had stringent restrictions in place to protect those aged under 18. Mobile networks required users to contact their provider and submit identification as proof of age before blocks were lifted. The website also required credit card details and payment authorisation which served as safeguards before any content could be accessed. Ms Louise understood that ads could be distasteful without causing serious or widespread offence under the Code. The fact that a product was offensive to some people was not grounds for the ASA to determine that the ad breached the Code. She also understood that while not everyone would wish to access adult content, that fact should not prevent it from being advertised, as long as the ads complied with the Code. Amplify Outdoor, the media owner, said they had not received any complaints directly. They confirmed that the ad was no longer appearing. They said they never intended to cause offence, but simply wished to provide a voice to a legitimate business. They reviewed the image to ensure it was suitable and provided Rebecca Louise with a list of potential sites. Those sites excluded locations within 100 metres of schools. They believed the ad was suitable for public display because it did not mention sexual services or pornographic content. OnlyFans was a locked site that prevented under-18s from accessing explicit content. They believed the image was similar to those used in shampoo, gym wear and lingerie advertising. It was, in their view, relevant to the advertiser’s brand and business and did not employ sexual appeal in a manner that was exploitative of women. Amplify pointed out that the poster’s use of an image and social media icons was consistent with many other poster ad campaigns. They did not believe that all those who saw the poster would view it as being sexual in nature. Children in general did not know about OnlyFans and adults did not need to explain the content to them. Amplify drew a parallel with alcohol and gambling ads that were similarly displayed in outdoor media. They added that the OnlyFans logo appeared widely at boxing matches, golf tournaments and other sporting events, and pointed out that OnlyFans included content other than that of a sexual nature - for example, Rebecca Louise had subscribers to her workout page.","Upheld The ad featured an image of Rebecca Louise alongside the web address of her OnlyFans page and the address of her Instagram page. The ad therefore promoted Rebecca Louise and her business on those online platforms. The ASA understood that the OnlyFans platform contained various kinds of content posted by subscribers to its service, including adult sexual content. We acknowledged that some people would find ads for such services distasteful because of the nature of the service advertised, particularly if they appeared in an untargeted medium. However, the Code stated that the fact that a product was offensive to some people was not grounds for finding a marketing communication in breach of the Code. Legitimate businesses were permitted to advertise as long as they did so responsibly. Our assessment was, therefore, focused on a consideration of the specific ad itself: the image; the text; and the overall impression and placement of the ad. The image showed Ms Louise wearing a push-up bra. The bra was made of shiny red material and featured buckles. It had additional straps that outlined the shape of her breasts and drew attention to her cleavage. Her head was at a slight angle, her mouth was slightly open and her eyes were looking directly into the camera. One hand was raised, which suggested that she was interacting with viewers. We considered that her expression, in combination with the styling and her pose, was suggestive and coquettish. We considered that the styling, pose and expression would be seen as sexualised and provocative. Although we acknowledged that it formed her social media handle, we considered that impression was further reinforced by the accompanying text RebeccaLouisex95, which included the word “sex”. We acknowledged that the image of Ms Louise was relevant to the OnlyFans service and in keeping with some of its usual content, which was sexual and explicit, but that the image was not exploitative or degrading in tone. Notwithstanding that, we considered that the combination of the image, the OnlyFans web address and the handle “@RebeccaLouisex95” meant that the ad taken as a whole would be seen as overtly sexual, particularly to those who were familiar with the content of the OnlyFans platform. The ad was shown on a poster in London close to a main road, which was an untargeted medium, and was therefore likely to be seen by large numbers of people, including under-18s. We acknowledged that Amplify had applied a targeting restriction in selecting a site that was not within 100 metres of any schools. We considered, however, because the ad was overtly sexual and was displayed in an untargeted medium where it had the potential to be seen by a large number of people, including children, it was irresponsible and likely to cause widespread offence. We concluded that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising) and 4.1 (Harm and offence).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Rebecca Louise to ensure that future advertising in outdoor media was not overtly sexual and to avoid causing widespread offence.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/rebecca-louise-g23-1219454-rebecca-louise.html
ASA Ruling on Supreme CBD Ltd t/a Supreme CBD,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","Four X (formerly Twitter) posts from the accounts of John Hartson @JohnHartson10, Anthony Fowler @afowler06 and Matt Le Tissier for Supreme CBD: a. The first tweet by John Hartson, seen on 5 February 2023, featured the text “Retweet and comment if you’ve tried these CBD gummy bears before bed they are honestly magic from @Supreme_cbd leave a comment an [sic] I’ll buy one of you a box or anyone else use code Hartson40 at supremecbd.uk/collections/al…believe me they help you sleep so much better with less anxiety”. Below the text was an image of Supreme CBD’s Large Gummy Bears product with an option to select quantity and a link to “Add to Cart”. b. The second tweet by John Hartson, seen on 6 February 2023, stated, “Hello Dave tell your Mrs I’ll buy her a box to help with her anxiety, @supreme_cbd is changing peoples lives for the better, I’ll DM you details [thumbs up emoji]”. c. A tweet by Anthony Fowler, seen on 6 February 2023, tagging @JohnHartson10 and @supreme_cbd, in response to a tweet which replied to ad (b) asking, “John does this really work for anxiety and insomnia?”, stated “Yes mate read the comments on his pinned tweet”. d. A tweet with an embedded video by Matt Le Tissier, seen on 15 May, tagging @Supreme CBD, featured text “I’ve been very sceptical of a lot of things including @supreme_cbd when it was first recommended to me, but it’s honestly a game changer for people with anxiety/depression any aches/pain or insomnia, my followers can save 40% with code Tiss40 at checkout supremecbd.uk”. The embedded video included Matt Le Tissier with three types of CBD product. In the video he made claims, “These gummies people are just telling me how well they are sleeping after taking these, helps a lot with the anxiety as does the oils” as well as “People are saying how these things are changing their lives”.","1. The complainants, who understood that John Hartson and Matt Le Tissier were brand ambassadors for Supreme CBD, challenged whether ads (a), (b) and (d) were obviously identifiable as marketing communications and did not make clear their commercial intent. The ASA challenged whether: 2. ad (c) was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication and did not make clear its commercial intent, because we understood Anthony Fowler was the owner of SupremeCBD; and 3. the stated and implied claims in ads (a) to (d) that Supreme CBD products could help anxiety and insomnia were claims to prevent, treat or cure disease which were in breach of the Code.","1. Supreme CBD Ltd said Supreme CBD was Anthony Fowler's own brand, and they did not consider that his relationship with John Hartson was commercial. They said there was no official contract in place other than a verbal agreement that Mr Hartson would receive a small amount of commission from his codes, as well as some free products. They said Mr Hartson had originally come to the brand as a paying customer, before becoming part of the Supreme CBD community. They said they had not been responsible for Mr Hartson’s tweets and he had not been given any guidance. They said that Matt Le Tissier was an affiliate and received commission from his personalised code, but there was no official contract and the arrangement had been made verbally. They explained that there were no restrictions in terms of what he was allowed to post about the brand. Mr Hartson said he had used Supreme CBD in a personal capacity and for that reason became a brand ambassador. He said that he did not have an official contract with Supreme CBD, but since he had a substantial social following, they offered small remuneration payments for the use of his social media platforms that had been agreed verbally. He said all activity was conducted by Supreme CBD directly, and that they had also requested that he film a small number of short videos that they embedded into content posted on his pages. On receiving the complaint notification he acknowledged that tweets sent in his name should have been labelled as ads. He amended ad (a) and had immediately withdrawn the facility for tweets to be sent on his behalf. He said he would ensure that all future tweets would be labelled clearly as marketing material. He also stated he was no longer working with Supreme CBD. Mr Le Tissier said that while he did not have a formal contract with Supreme CBD, and there was no control over his posts by the brand, he did receive commission. He said in future he would include an appropriate identifier on his posts. 2. Anthony Fowler said that since Supreme CBD was his own brand, he did not class himself as an influencer. However, he recognised in future his posts would need to be obviously identifiable as advertising. 3. Anthony Fowler for Supreme CBD said they had been unaware that the posts had been making medical claims and said that they would refrain from making such claims in the future. John Hartson said that he acknowledged in some instances his tweets had made claims that he could not substantiate. Matt Le Tissier said that he had been referring to personal experience and feedback he had received from others, and was unaware that talking about the benefits of the products would be unacceptable. He said he would ensure he did not mention any medical benefits in the future.","1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such and that they must make clear their commercial intent, if that was not obvious from the context. The ASA understood that there was a financial agreement in place between Supreme CBD and both Mr Hartson and Mr Le Tissier, and that they both received commission for sales generated from the use of their personalised codes by consumers. Those personalised codes were therefore directly connected with the supply of goods provided by Supreme CBD, and because of that, posts (a) and (d) were considered ads for the purposes of the Code. We understood that as part of the financial agreement, Mr Hartson had given Supreme CBD direct control of his social media accounts and they were responsible for all his posts about Supreme CBD; that included ad (b). We also understood that Mr Le Tissier was, and Mr Hartson had been, brand ambassadors for Supreme CBD and were featured within an “Ambassadors section” on the Supreme CBD website. They each had their own individual ambassador profile page that included personal information and imagery as well as product links for their “product of choice” that linked through to product purchase pages. Ads (a), (b) and (d) each featured the tag “@Supreme_CBD”, and referenced the products that linked to their “product of choice” that were seen on their brand ambassador page. We considered it was likely that as a brand ambassador there would be an expectation that they would be positive about the brand. The role of brand ambassador, we considered therefore constituted a commercial relationship with Supreme CBD, and further underlined that they had a relationship with the brand. All their posts made about Supreme CBD, therefore, fell within the remit of the CAP Code. For those reasons we considered the commercial intent of posts (a), (b) and (d) should have been identifiable as such. However, there was nothing within their content, such as ‘ad’ placed upfront, which made clear to those viewing that these were ads. We welcomed Mr Hartson’s and Mr Le Tissier’s amendments and acknowledged that Mr Hartson was no longer a brand ambassador for Supreme CBD. However, in the absence of clear and prominent identifiers at the time ads (a), (b) and (d) were seen, we concluded that they were not obviously identifiable as marketing communications and as such breached the Code. On that point, ads (a), (b) and (d) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications). 2. Upheld As above, the CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and that they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. We understood that Mr Fowler was the owner of Supreme CBD and therefore had a commercial interest in the brand. Ad (c) was a response to a tweet about whether a Supreme CBD product worked for anxiety and insomnia, and therefore was a direct endorsement of the product referenced. We considered that from the post itself, it was not clear that Mr Fowler had a commercial interest in Supreme CBD. The commercial nature of ad (c) therefore should have been made clear. We assessed the post as it appeared within X (formerly Twitter) and considered that there was nothing within the content that made it clear to those viewing that the post was an ad. We welcomed Mr Fowler’s engagement with the ASA; nonetheless, we considered the post was not obviously identifiable as marketing communication and concluded the ad breached the Code. On that point, ad (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications). 3. Upheld The CAP Code stated that claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease were prohibited. The ads made a number of claims that we considered would be interpreted by consumers as claims to prevent, treat and cure human disease. In particular, ad (a) stated, “believe me they help you sleep so much better with less anxiety”, ad (b) stated, “I’ll buy her a box to help with her anxiety, @supremecbd is changing peoples [sic] lives for the better”, and ad (c) stated, “Yes mate read the comments on his pinned tweet” in reply to the question “[…] does this really work for anxiety and insomnia?”. In addition, ad (d) stated, “a game changer for people with anxiety/depression […] or insomnia”, “people are just telling me how well they are sleeping after taking these, helps a lot with the anxiety as does the oils” and “people are saying how these things are changing their lives”. We welcomed Supreme CBD, Mr Fowler’s, Mr Hartson’s and Mr Le Tissier’s assurance that the claims would be amended. However, because at the time the ads were seen they included claims that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure disease, we concluded that they breached the Code. On that point, the ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ads must not appear in their current form. We told Supreme CBD, Anthony Fowler, John Hartson and Matt Le Tissier to ensure their future ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications, and that identifiers such as ‘#ad’ were used and were clearly and prominently displayed. We also told them to ensure their future ads did not state or imply that the products could prevent, treat or cure human disease.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/supreme-cbd-ltd-g23-1198642-supreme-cbd-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on BKUK Group Ltd t/a Burger King,,"Three emails from Burger King: a. The first email, dated 12 August 2023, included a large photo of the “Doritos King Box”. Text underneath the image stated, “Doritos King Box […] Don’t worry, summer. We’ll take it from here. You thought summer was over? Well, think again, hot stuff – we’ve got a scorcher of a deal for you! Add Doritos Chilli Heatwave Chicken Fries (5 pc) to your Classic Cheese Melt or BBQ Double Melt King Box – all for just £5.99!” b. The second email, dated 18 August 2023, included a large photo of a “Spicy Mayo Whopper” burger and a “Spicy Mayo Chicken Royale” burger, surrounded by stylised orange flames and large text that stated, “SPICY MAYO”. Underneath the image, text stated, “Your favourites, all fired up […] Order a Spicy Mayo Whopper (Single) or Spicy Mayo Chicken Royale and get another one completely free – for this weekend ONLY!” c. The third email, dated 20 August 2023, included the same as ad (b). Text underneath the image stated, “Your favourites, all fired up for one weekend only […] Grab yourself a Spicy Mayo Whopper (Single) or Spicy Mayo Chicken Royale plus one more for free.”","Food Active challenged whether the ads were for products that were high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS product ads) that were directed at children through the selection of media or context in which they appeared.","BKUK Group Ltd t/a Burger King said they were careful to take all reasonable steps to avoid targeting their ads at under 16-year-olds. Their terms of service, which were available on their website, app and related channels, stated that the “YourBurgerKing” service was designed for use by persons who were at least 16 years old. The terms also stated that people under the age of 16 who signed up for the service confirmed, by doing so, that they had received permission from their parent or guardian before using the service. Burger King said they did not prevent people who registered their age as being under 16 from signing up to the service because of that confirmation requirement. Furthermore, the age field on the sign-up form was optional because they believed it was not mandatory for a consumer to share their date of birth during the sign-up process.","Upheld The CAP Code required that HFSS product ads must not be directed at people under the age of 16 through the selection of media or the context in which they appeared. The ads, three emails sent to registered users of the “YourBurgerKing” service, featured promotions enabling consumers to add items to a Burger King meal deal at a discounted rate, or to get another item as part of a ‘buy-one-get-one-free’ offer. The ASA understood that the meals seen in the emails were HFSS products and, as such, considered that the promotional messages were ads for HFSS products for the purposes of the Code. CAP Guidance stated that if data was used to create an audience, for example a mailing list for direct or email marketing, marketers must ensure they had taken all reasonable steps to exclude under-16s from the list or targeting criteria. Anyone with a date of birth that meant they were under-16 should be removed. We understood that “YourBurgerKing” was a rewards scheme which enabled users to earn reward points for every pound spent when purchasing Burger King products online or in-store, which could then be redeemed against future food purchases, and to receive promotional offers. The only mandatory information users were required to provide when signing up for a “YourBurgerKing” account was a first name and an email address. The “YourBurgerKing” sign-up page included a drop-down section labelled “Optional Information”, which allowed users to enter their date of birth and postcode if they wished. In order to create an account, users needed to tick a box confirming that they had agreed to Burger King’s privacy policy, rewards terms and terms of service, all of which were linked from the sign-up page. Users could also choose whether to opt-in to receive marketing communications regarding special offers. The terms of service stated that “YourBurgerKing"" was intended for use by people who were at least 16 years old, or that users who were under the age of 16 obtained permission from their parent or guardian. However, that information was not presented on the sign-up page, and registration could be completed without needing to have read the terms of service. In any case, we considered that if data was used to create an audience that it should, where necessary, be used to exclude individuals on the basis of their age, and it was not sufficient only to state that the service should not be accessed by under-16s. While we noted that users could sign up for a “YourBurgerKing” account without providing a date of birth, we considered that it would still have been possible to exclude users who had provided a date of birth which showed that they were under 16 from receiving promotional emails and notifications for HFSS foods. Regardless of whether a user had provided a date of birth, because users under the age of 16 were freely able to sign up to Burger King’s service, we also considered that Burger King should have taken steps to ensure that registered users under the age of 16 did not receive promotional materials for HFSS foods. We also understood that if an organisation relied on consent as their lawful basis for processing a child’s personal data, in the UK, only children aged 13 or over were able to provide their own consent. We therefore considered that Burger King should have taken further steps, beyond self-declaration at the point of sign-up, to ensure that children under the age of 16 were not at risk of receiving promotional materials for HFSS foods. The ads, which were for HFSS products, had been sent to an individual with a registered age of a 15-year-old. For that reason, we considered Burger King had not taken reasonable steps to exclude under-16s from the audience, and that the ads had been directed at children through the selection of media in which they appeared. We therefore concluded that they breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 15.18 (HFSS Product Ad Placement).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told BKUK Group Ltd to ensure that HFSS product ads were not directed at children through the selection of media or the context in which they appeared.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/bkuk-group-ltd-a23-1210912-bkuk-group-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on BMW (UK) Ltd,,"A paid for Google ad for BMW seen on 16 August 2023 featured the claim, “Zero Emissions Cars – Download Your Brochure Today. Visit BMW’s official online website. Find the perfect BMW electric car. Book a test drive. Explore a range of BMW electric cars …”.","The ASA challenged whether the claim ""Zero Emissions Cars"" misleadingly represented the vehicles’ environmental impact.","BMW (UK) Ltd said they had bid on terms such as “Zero Emission Cars” to target consumers who used such searches to find out information about battery electric vehicles (BEV). They said the term “Zero Emission Cars” was inserted into the ad due to the automatic keyword feature in Google Ads. They were not aware that facility had been activated for those search results and it was only on receiving the complaint they discovered it. The result was that the claim appeared in a small selection of search results. Specifically, 0.02% of the impressions delivered by the BMW paid search activity. They said they were aware that when making claims about zero emissions in relation to BEV, an ad should make clear that it is only when driving and this was otherwise reflected across their marketing communications. They confirmed they had halted all bidding on “Zero Emissions Cars” keywords and reviewed all generic keywords they bid against. They said in future they would turn off the automatic keyword feature in Google Ads when bidding for “Zero Emissions Cars” keywords and add manual copy to ensure greater control. They would also vet future activity with generic keywords before activation.","Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so. The basis of environmental claims must be clear. The ad stated, in the headline text, “Zero Emissions Cars”. It then continued, “Find the perfect BMW electric car” and “Explore a range of BMW electric cars”. The ASA therefore understood that consumers would interpret the ad as promoting BMW’s portfolio of electric cars and that those cars would produce zero emissions in all circumstances. We understood that when electric vehicles were driven no emissions were produced, unlike a car with a petrol or diesel engine where emissions came from the tailpipe. However, in other circumstances, such as the manufacture or charging of an electric vehicle using electricity from the national grid, emissions were generated. For that reason an ad that featured a “zero emissions” claim, that did not make explicitly clear that it was related to the reaction of the vehicle while it was being driven was likely to mislead. Without material information to make clear to consumers what the claim was based on and clarification that it was restricted to emissions only when driving, we concluded ""Zero Emissions Cars"" was likely to mislead. We welcomed BMW’s assurance that the claim would not be repeated in the future. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification) and 11.1 (Environmental Claims).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told BMW (UK) Ltd to ensure that ads referring to “zero emissions”; made clear that the claim related to an electric vehicle only when it was being driven.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/bmw--uk--ltd-a23-1209400-bmw--uk--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Greater London Authority,,"A radio ad for the expansion of the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) in London, heard between February and March 2023, started with the sound of traffic from an open car door and then featured a voiceover that stated, “You do up your seat belt and check your rear-view mirror. You’ve got air bags and anti-lock brakes. Everything in your car is designed to protect you, but none of that will protect you from this … the air you’re breathing. According to research, one of the most polluted places in London is inside your car. That’s why the ULEZ is expanding across all London boroughs. Search ULEZ 2023 to find out about the support available. Let’s clear the air.”","The complainants challenged whether the claim “According to research, one of the most polluted places in London is inside your car” was misleading and could be substantiated.","The Greater London Authority (GLA) said multiple research studies had shown that the inside of a car was one of the spaces most exposed to air pollution. They provided ten reports – a pilot study, four reviews of studies in this area, four studies on the level of air pollution to which drivers were exposed and a study that examined levels of pollution to which children were exposed when travelling to school. They also provided a video produced by The Guardian newspaper and King’s College London, a 2017 newspaper article, and referred to the Chief Medical Officer’s annual report 2022. The GLA said they regularly reported on air pollution by using the city’s air quality monitoring network to analyse the long-term trends in the level of pollution in the air. The most recent model they had produced was the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI) 2019. The LAEI modelled ground level concentrations of pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) in µg/m3 at 20m grid resolution. They said that the dataset from 2019 demonstrated that the limits for NO2 and PM2.5, as established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2021, were not achieved anywhere in London. They referred to three points within the 2019 LAEI. Firstly, that all areas of London exceeded safe limits of air pollution as defined by the WHO. Secondly, that road transport was the single largest source of both nitrogen oxides (NOx – the collective term for nitrous oxide and nitrogen dioxide) and PM2.5 emissions in London. Thirdly, concentrations of NO2 were higher alongside roads in comparison to surrounding areas. They said that their evidence showed that exposure to air pollution was highest when people were closer to the source of emissions. It also demonstrated that road transport was the single largest source of NOx and PM2.5 emissions, which were two of the main air pollutants in London, and that levels of NO2 concentrations and exposure were highest alongside roads. And finally, that travelling within a car or van could expose a person to more air pollution than any other form of road transport. Radiocentre said they agreed with the GLA’s response.","Upheld The ASA considered listeners would understand the claim “According to research, one of the most polluted places in London is inside your car”, in the context of an ad about the expansion of the ULEZ, to mean the level of air pollution in a car in London ranked among the places with the highest levels of air pollution in the city. We therefore expected to see evidence that compared the level of air pollution in cars in London to the level of air pollution in a variety of other contexts in which a person in London might find themselves. We assessed the evidence provided by the GLA. The pilot study focused on the levels of air pollution, specifically PM2.5 and PM10, NO2, and carbon dioxide (CO2), to which professional drivers of taxis, waste removal trucks, hospital shuttlebuses and ambulances were exposed when working in London. The level of air pollution inside the cabin of their vehicles was compared with the level of air pollution at two roadside monitoring stations at Marylebone Street and Honor Oak Park. The study found that occupational drivers faced levels of PM and NO2 concentration similar to those found at the Marylebone Road site, and at a higher NO2-to-PM ratio than at the site in Honor Oak Park. While the study did suggest that those car users were exposed to air pollution it did not comment on why these monitoring sites had been chosen and whether the level of pollution at them was representative of levels across London, or whether the average non-professional driver would spend similar average amounts of time in traffic to those who participated in the study. We considered the experience of the drivers in the study was likely to be different to that of the average non-professional driver – for example, the amount of time spent in heavy traffic, and how often their car doors were opened. While the study did offer a comparison between car users and two locations in London, we did not consider that the extent of this comparison aligned with how the claim in the ad would be interpreted. GLA referred to a study by the Institution of Occupational Health and Safety, which examined the level of exposure to diesel pollution that professional drivers based in London faced. The study monitored the levels of exposure to black carbon that 141 professional drivers of buses, vans (electric and diesel), ambulances, fire engines, lorries, taxis and waste trucks faced while at work and in their daily life over a four-day period via an air quality monitoring device with GPS capacity. The study placed the locations the drivers were monitored at into four categories: ‘At work driving’ (during work hours and moving); ‘At work not driving’ (during work hours and stopped); ‘Commuting’ (outside of work hours and moving); and ‘At home’ (outside of work hours and stopped). The study showed that the more time participants faced driving at work in comparison to ‘At work not driving’, ‘Commuting’ and ‘At home’, the greater the level of their exposure to pollution. It found that ‘At work driving’ exposure was 3.8 times higher than ‘at home’ exposure. Additionally, it outlined that when a participant was in their vehicle, they were more likely to be more exposed to pollution than when they were not. For example, when 18.6% of their time was spent ‘At work driving’, this resulted in 36.1% of total pollution exposure, and when 54.4% of time was spent ‘At home’ this only contributed 31.8% of total exposure. Additionally, the study noted that average ‘Commuting’ exposures were relatively high, but with only 4% of time spent in this activity, it only contributed 7.9% to the total exposure. We acknowledged that the report highlighted that a notable amount of the British population was employed in jobs involving driving and recommended that to limit pollution exposure people should avoid congested areas, including central London. However, we did not consider that the experience of professional drivers when in their vehicle, due to factors such as the length of time, the locations visited, the frequency of stopping and starting, or the type of vehicle used, were necessarily representative of the experiences, and therefore exposure to pollution while in a car, that the average listener would have. While the experience of the drivers in the study, who were based in London, when not at work, was relevant, the study did not detail what ‘commuting’ constituted beyond that it referred to exposure that occurred outside of work hours while the participant was moving. It did not necessarily exclusively refer to exposure that had occurred in a car being used in a similar capacity to an average driver. The study did demonstrate that most of the pollution that professional drivers in London were exposed to occurred when they were driving. It had not, however, demonstrated that this aligned with how non-professional drivers used a car or whether the exposure during a participant’s non-work hours arose from being in a car. GLA provided four reviews of studies in this area. Two reviews examined the level of air pollution commuters were exposed to when using different modes of transport in various European cities, including London. The London-focused studies were conducted between 1998 and 2008. Some preceded the implementation of the congestion charge in 2003, and all preceded the implementation of the original ULEZ in 2019. We considered that these policies could have changed London’s air quality, and any comparison to substantiate the ad’s claim would therefore need to take into account London’s ambient air quality in 2023. Furthermore, we acknowledged that the reports had made a comparison between pollution exposure when in a car and other forms of travel, such as walking or cycling. However, we considered the ad suggested that the inside of a car was one of the most polluted places in London, and that the evidence would need to demonstrate this, including in relation to other forms of travel and a variety of other locations across London. The third review article pertained to air pollution in Germany and the different ways in which people were exposed to pollutants when in a car. We therefore considered it was not relevant substantiation for the claim, which was specific to London and where a ULEZ zone had already been implemented. The fourth review was produced by the Environmental Research Group. It was funded by the GLA, but its analysis was independently prepared. It observed that a study had found that commuting accounted for 6% of a person’s time, but was responsible for approximately 30% of a person’s exposure to air pollution. The review itself focused on Traffic Related Air Pollution (TRAP), a combination of particulate and gaseous pollutants from vehicle exhausts as well as particles produced from the wear of road surfaces, tyres and brakes. It outlined that levels of TRAP were highly localised to the roadside and that they fell rapidly as the distance from the roadside was increased. It then reasoned that road users themselves occupy the highest pollutant microenvironment and were therefore disproportionately exposed to TRAP. We acknowledged the review had established that being in a car led to a high level of pollution exposure, that cars were amongst the modes of transport that led to the most pollution exposure, and that some of the studies included within the review had focused on London. We acknowledged a study within the review had shown that commuting led to a disproportionately high level of pollution exposure in comparison to the proportion of time spent doing it. However, the review’s comparison had only focused on pollution exposure when using different modes of transport. It had not commented on pollution exposure in other parts of daily life, and we did not consider that it had necessarily outlined that the inside of a car was one of the most polluted places in London. We assessed the Chief Medical Officer’s annual report 2022. We acknowledged that it established that proximity to the source of emission, such as living near major roads and in higher-density urban settings, was a controlling factor in exposure to short-lived pollutants such as NO2. However, while it did demonstrate that pollution exposure was impacted by proximity, we considered that this did not necessarily equate to demonstrating that the pollution levels inside a car were amongst the highest places of pollution exposure in London. Additionally, we reviewed the study that examined the levels of pollution that children were exposed to when travelling to school. It was funded by the GLA. The levels of pollution that 258 children across five different primary schools in London faced when travelling to and from school were examined. The study found that children who travelled, by a variety of different methods, via busier main roads were exposed to more pollution than those who travelled on quieter side roads. The majority of students did not use a car or bus when travelling to their school. The study noted that it was unable to draw any robust conclusions between these modes of travel and more active modes like walking, cycling or riding a scooter, but that its findings did suggest that children who walked along roads that had heavy traffic could potentially be exposed to higher levels of pollution than children who were driven or took the bus to school. Resultingly, while the report did suggest that proximity to the source of pollution influenced the level of exposure, it had not demonstrated that the inside of a car was one of the most polluted places in London. We reviewed the LAEI. We understood that it had been produced by the GLA and Transport for London (TfL), and they had received input from Imperial College London, two environment focused consultancy firms, Heathrow airport and the Port of London Authority. It was a dataset focused on London that modelled and made estimates over a range of areas, including but not limited to, emission trends, maps that outlined the concentration of NO2 and PM2.5, and PM10 in 2019 and in the future, and population exposure data for NO2 and PM2.5. It detailed that in 2019 air pollution in London exceeded the WHO’s recommended limits, that road transport was the single largest source of NOx and PM2.5, and that NO2 concentrations were high alongside major roads. We acknowledged that these findings outlined that London’s air was polluted, including alongside major roads, and that road vehicles were a significant contributor to that. However, the LAEI did not indicate the level of pollution found inside a car, or directly compare the level of pollution a person inside a car faced against the level of pollution exposure in other contexts in London. We assessed the three reports of experiments on the levels of air pollution that car users faced. None of the studies were based in London. The first was based in Leicester, the second was based in Asan and Chunan, South Korea, and the third was based in Los Angeles. We acknowledged that cars within London would not be substantively different to those in Leicester, South Korea and Los Angeles, but we had not seen evidence that clarified the ambient air quality in these cities was the same as London’s and that inside of a car would be one of the most polluted places in London. The Guardian video and newspaper article referred to high levels of pollution exposure when in a car. We acknowledged the experiment conducted in the video demonstrated that car usage led to a higher level of pollution exposure than when using other forms of transport. However, as the video’s experiment, the reports and the newspaper article only compared the level of pollution commuters faced when using different modes of transport or did not focus on London, we did not consider them adequate substantiation for the claim. The evidence provided had established that proximity to the source of pollution increased exposure, car users were exposed to air pollution when inside their vehicle and that it could be higher than when using other forms of transport, and that London’s air was polluted. However, a direct comparison between the level of air pollution within a car in London to a variety of other locations and contexts around London had not been made. For those reasons we concluded that the claim “According to research, one of the most polluted places in London is inside your car” had not been adequately substantiated and was likely to materially mislead. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Substantiation), and 9.4 (Environmental claims).",We told the Greater London Authority to ensure that relevant evidence was held in support of all objective marketing claims.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/greater-london-authority-g23-1202588-greater-london-authority.html

Zero Emissions"".","The ASA challenged whether the claim ""Zero Emissions"" misleadingly represented the vehicles’ environmental impact.",MG confirmed that all references to ‘Zero Emissions’ had been removed from their ads.,"Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so. The basis of environmental claims must be clear. The ad stated, “Save £1,000 On Your Next MG HS Plug-in Hybrid, MG ZS or MG5 EV Trophy Long Range …” It then finished with the text, “Zero Emissions”. Consumers were likely to interpret the ad as promoting MG’s HS Plug-in Hybrid, MG ZS or MG5 EV Trophy Long Range and, in that context, that the “Zero Emissions” claim related to all of the vehicle types listed, in all circumstances. The MG HS Plug-in Hybrid contained a petrol engine and a 90 kW electric motor, the MG ZS had a petrol engine only, although there was a fully electric version referred to as the MG ZS EV, and the MG5 EV Trophy Long Range was fully electric. We understood that when electric vehicles, unlike those with petrol or diesel engines, were driven no emissions were produced. However, in other circumstances, such as the manufacture of the car or when it was charged using electricity from the national grid, emissions were generated. The basis of the claim in the ad was not explained. A ‘zero emissions’ claim for a fully electric vehicle, that did not make explicitly clear it related to emissions produced when the vehicle was being driven was likely to mislead. Hybrid vehicles emitted greenhouse gases from the tailpipe when the petrol or diesel source was in use. Any associated ‘zero emissions’ claim needed to clarify that it referred to emissions while the vehicle was driven on the electric motor. Similar claims for vehicles powered by petrol or diesel engines would always mislead. The ad made the claim “Zero Emissions” without material information that was required to allow consumers to understand on what it was based. It did not differentiate between the vehicle types or clarify that the claim was restricted to emissions when an electric vehicle was being driven. We concluded that the ad, therefore, was likely to mislead.

ASA Ruling on Vizor Apps Ltd,,"A pre-roll ad on YouTube, seen on 8 November 2023, for the mobile app game Klondike Adventures, included an animated video of a slim woman wearing a tight red dress walking past a house, as a man watched her from inside and animated love hearts appeared around his head. The video then showed another woman appearing in the window next to the man, also looking at the passing woman, and noticing the man’s reaction to her. The second woman was depicted as being of a larger body-type than the first, and was wearing a baggy jumper and jeans with stains on them. The video then cut to inside the house, which was depicted as being in a messy state, as the second woman looked at her own body animated question marks appeared around her head. The man started shouting at the woman, as red anger lines appeared around him and a speech bubble with symbols meant to represent swear words appeared by his head. As the man continued to berate the woman, she looked scared and sad. On-screen text then appeared, which stated, “HELP HER START A NEW LIFE"" with the option to “IGNORE” or “HELP”. The video then cut to the woman walking through a snowstorm, carrying a newborn baby, followed by a series of clips of gameplay from the Klondike Adventures game.","The complainant, who believed that the ad promoted body-shaming and sexualised and objectified women, plus depicting harmful gender stereotypes, challenged whether the ad was irresponsible, harmful and offensive.","Vizor Apps Ltd said that upon receiving notification of the complaint they had temporarily withdrawn the ad from circulation, pending the outcome of the ASA’s investigation. They said that Klondike Adventures was an interactive game which featured the main characters seen in the ad - Kate and Paul - and that both characters were well known to people who played the game. The ad had included scenes of the main characters in which they were casually dressed. They said that Kate had been depicted wearing a baggy jumper and jeans to raise empathy with sections of the intended audience, and that the stains seen on her clothes were included for narrative reasons. Vizor did not believe that the ad promoted body-shaming, sexualisation and objectification of women, or harmful gender stereotypes. They said that the animation of Kate, when not wearing baggy clothes, depicted her as having the same body type as the other female character seen in the ad, who Paul was shown looking at. They had not meant to depict Kate as having a different body type as that other character, only to show her dressed in a different style. They said the choice to depict Kate in baggy clothes was driven by narrative and character development considerations, and the intention had not been to compare the two female character’s body types, but to juxtapose how they were dressed. Vizor said Paul’s reaction showed that he was saddened by the style of Kate’s clothing, but was not meant to be seen as threatening. They believed his behaviour was not driven by Kate’s gender or appearance, and that her clothing had instead been a catalyst linked to wider problems they faced as a couple, beyond the narrative of the individual ad. They said Paul’s behaviour was meant to be seen as being unreasonable, and that the narrative of the ad had intended to expose controversial stereotypes as a form of social commentary. They also said that the speech bubbles which appeared above his head only implied speech, and that there was no literal wording associated with his behaviour. They believed that meant that Paul’s comments were ambiguous. Viewers could not assume that he was holding Kate responsible for the upkeep and cleanliness of the home. Because they believed that Paul’s comments were ambiguous, Vizor also thought that they could not have reinforced a gender stereotype. Vizor said they were committed to working with the ASA to ensure their ads were compliant with the CAP Code.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that ads must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, must not cause serious or widespread offence and must not include gender stereotypes that were likely to cause harm. CAP guidance said that ads may feature people undertaking gender-stereotypical roles, but they should take care to avoid suggesting that stereotypical roles or characteristics were always uniquely associated with one gender. Gender stereotypical roles included occupations or positions usually associated with a specific gender; for example, women carrying out domestic chores. The ad depicted a female character, dressed in figure-hugging clothes which accentuated her hourglass figure, being watched by a male character who reacted in a sexualised and excited manner as she passed his house. The male character was then shown looking at his partner, another female character. He behaved in an aggressive and unpleasant manner, shouting and swearing at her, and berating her for her appearance and the uncleanliness of their house. That second female character was shown as being upset by the male character’s actions, as well as seeming to unfavourably compare her own appearance to that of the first woman. The ASA considered that viewers would understand the first female character had been presented as having an idealised gender-stereotypical figure due to her body type and style of clothing, and was depicted as a sexual object. That was reinforced by the male character’s reaction to her, which included a change in his demeanour and expression as he leered at her in an aggressive manner, and love hearts appeared around his head. We also considered that viewers would interpret the second female character’s appearance, including the stains on her clothing, to be intended to be seen as less conventionally attractive than that of the first. That was emphasised by the contrast in the male character’s treatment of both female characters. We considered Vizor’s argument that the second female character was only wearing baggier clothing than the first, rather than being seen as having a different body type, and that the male character’s behaviour was not driven by his partner’s appearance or gender, but instead by wider problems outside of the narrative of the ad. However, due to the style in which the two female characters were animated we considered that viewers were likely to interpret the ad as showing them as having different body types, rather than only wearing different styles of clothing. We considered that viewers would understand from the male character’s reaction and behaviour that he was aggressively criticising his partner for not looking more like the first female character. The ad therefore implied her physique and appearance played an important part in the problems she was facing. We considered that his behaviour therefore both sexualised and objectified the first female character, and body-shamed the second character for not conforming to an idealised gender-stereotypical body. We further considered that the male character’s anger about the dirty and untidy state of the house, which he directed at his partner, reinforced a gender stereotype that the female character was responsible for the upkeep and cleanliness of the home. We considered that the behaviour depicted in the ad condoned and encouraged the sexualisation, objectification and body-shaming of women. We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread offence, included a gender stereotype in a way that was likely to cause harm, was socially irresponsible and had breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Vizor Apps Ltd to ensure future ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious or widespread harm and offence including by objectifying women, body-shaming, or presenting gender stereotypes in a way that was likely to cause harm.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/vizor-apps-ltd-a23-1221098-vizor-apps-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Witcombe Festival,,,"The complainant, who had been notified that they had won the prize draw but did not receive the prize as described, or a reasonable equivalent, challenged whether the promotion breached the Code.","Witcombe Festival said the prize was a backstage experience, although there was no specific artist that the winner would meet. On the day, the artist’s touring management did not want any public or competition winners backstage at the time. If the artist changed their mind, there was very little that they could do to accommodate the public backstage. They said that during the festival the complainant was verbally offered another prize which was either the opportunity to go backstage to meet another artist or tickets for next year’s festival. However, this was turned down by the complainant.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that promoters must award the prizes as described in their marketing communications, or reasonable equivalents. The ad stated “SIGN UP FOR PRESALE + WIN A VIP BACKSTAGE EXPERIENCE, TICKETS & MORE!” and “Sign up for exclusive ticket access and win HUGE money-can’t-buy prizes including a VIP backstage experience!”. The ASA considered that the ad encouraged consumers to sign up for the pre-sale of tickets on the basis that they might win the prizes. We also considered that consumers would understand from the ad that if they won the VIP backstage experience, they would get the opportunity to go backstage during the festival. We understood that the complainant was notified by email that they had won two VIP Weekend Camping Tickets, an A-list backstage experience and a ride in the artist’s private buggy to the festival. Whilst they had been able to claim the VIP Weekend camping tickets, despite following the steps to claim the prize, when they contacted Witcombe Festival prior to the event to ask how they would get the backstage passes and provided proof of the bundle of prizes that they had won, they were not given information about how to claim the A-list backstage experience or the ride in the artist’s private buggy. We further understood that during the festival, when the complainant tried to claim the backstage experience and the buggy ride, they were informed by the festival staff available on the day that they were temporary staff and were not able to help, nor did they know who the complainant should speak to. They suggested that the complainant should email the festival organisers, which they did, but they did not receive a response. We therefore considered that because the complainant was not able to claim the backstage experience or ride in the artist’s private buggy, the prize had not been awarded in full. We noted that Witcombe Festival said that the complainant was verbally offered the opportunity to go backstage to meet another artist or tickets for next year’s festival. However, as referenced above, the staff at the event did not know who the complainant needed to speak with about this part of the prize. In any case, we had not seen evidence that Witcombe Festival had offered the complainant an alternative prize. We therefore considered that a reasonable equivalent had not been awarded. We considered that Witcombe Festival should not have offered the VIP backstage experience if they could not guarantee they could fulfil the prize at the time of the event because artists could refuse members of the public from going backstage. Therefore, because part of the prize had not been awarded, nor had we seen evidence that they offered a reasonable equivalent, we concluded that the promotion breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.1, 8.2 (Promotional marketing), 8.14 and 8.15.1 (Administration).",We told Witcombe Festival to ensure that they awarded prizes as described in their marketing communications or a reasonable equivalent and that they should not offer prizes that cannot be guaranteed in full.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/witcombe-festival-a23-1211731-witcombe-festival.html
ASA Ruling on Brooksdale Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on PPI tax rebate advertising. See also a related ruling published on 31 January 2024. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Three paid-for Facebook ads for Your PPI Tax Rebate, a PPI tax rebate company, seen in April 2023: a. The first ad stated, “Thousands of Brits are receiving tax refunds from HMRC. Check now to see if you have a successful claim […] Customers have received payouts of over £11,000. Discover what you could be owed”. The ad included an image of a Union Jack. Further text stated, “HMRC Refunds. Largest claim: £11,767.69. Help with cost of living; 60 second process; It’s free to check”. b. The second ad featured the same initial text as ad (a) as well as an image of a Union Jack. Prominent text stated, “Struggling with the Cost of Living?” Further text in a grey box, with a green line running down the side, stated, “This HMRC rebate is still available to claim. Largest rebate: £11,767.69. Claim your rebate”. In the bottom right corner of the box was the text “UK Resident Service” next to an illustration of a house. c. The third ad featured the same initial text as ad (a) and an image with overlaying text which stated, “Struggling With The Cost Of Living? This HMRC rebate is still available to claim. Largest rebate: £11,767.69. Claim your rebate”. At the foot of the image was “UK Resident Service” next to an illustration of a house.",The ASA challenged whether the ads: 1. misleadingly implied they were from HMRC or for an official government service; and 2. irresponsibly took advantage of peoples’ concerns about the cost of living crisis.,,"The ASA was concerned by Your PPI Tax Rebate’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a substantive response to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. 1. & 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not claim that the marketer (or any other entity referred to), the marketing communication or the advertised product had been approved, endorsed or authorised by any public or other body if it had not. We understood Your PPI Tax Rebate assisted consumers in claiming tax deducted from statutory interest paid alongside payment protection insurance (PPI) refunds. Your PPI Tax Rebate charged a fee for completing the relevant form and contacting HMRC about the tax rebate. There was no official or approved third-party body for issuing such tax rebates. The ads were seen in the context of widespread news coverage about the increasing cost of living. That coverage included a focus on high inflation, which had affected the affordability of goods and services for households and had left some people struggling financially. All ads included the text “Struggling With The Cost of Living”. Additionally, ad (a) referred to “HMRC Refunds”, and ads (b) and (c) referred to “HMRC rebate” and “UK Resident Service"". We considered the presentation of the ads, such as the font and graphics used, were similar to those used on UK government department websites, and Facebook accounts. We considered that presentation and text gave the impression the ads had come from, or been endorsed by, an official government body that could help consumers struggling with the increased cost of living. However, we understood the ads had not been endorsed or approved by any official body. We considered that risked exploiting some consumers’ concerns about their finances and contributed to the impression that the ads were from an official government source that could help with the increased cost of living. Because the ads gave the impression they had been endorsed or approved by an official government body when they had not, and because they took advantage of peoples’ concerns about the cost of living crisis, we considered they were irresponsible and likely to mislead, and had therefore breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 3.1 (Misleading advertising), and 3.50 (Endorsements and testimonials).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Churchill Retirement Living Ltd t/a Churchill Retirement Living,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, of which two were Upheld and one was Upheld in relation to ad (a) only.","A website and paid for Facebook post for Churchill Retirement Living Ltd seen in March 2023: a. A page on the Churchill website www.churchillretirement.co.uk/cost-of-living, included text that stated, “Churchill’s Ambassador Dame Esther Rantzen recently took part in a cost of living mini-feature with Churchill, looking at the savings and energy efficiency benefits of downsizing from a typical three bedroom house to a new Churchill apartment.” The page included a video, which featured Dame Esther Rantzen who said, “At Churchill we did a survey and found one in four retirees are giving up their retirement and going back to work. Some feel pressured to go back to cover their increasing monthly expenses.” A Churchill Owner identified as “Patricia Chiverton” was introduced. They said, “I don’t think I would have been comfortable having the heating on in the old place. I think I would have rationed myself probably to evenings when I sat down and maybe for an hour in the morning when I got up.” Dame Esther Rantzen continued, “But energy bills have for many of us have confronted us with an unexpected new challenge. So what if anything can be done to help maintain your standard of living when you retire without taking such drastic measures as having to return to work?” Comments appeared in several areas of a home. They included “Draughty Doorways”, “Cold Corners” “Power Hungry Appliances” and “Rocketing Bills”. The video showed two men, identified as independent energy experts comparing a three-bedroom semi-detached house with a Churchill apartment. Dame Esther Rantzen said, “With Dion’s calculations now complete we can now tell you when it comes to saving money between the two properties … the total is a whopping one thousand one hundred and sixty saved per year just on energy bills” and later “… results show us the energy savings someone could expect if they moved from a three bedroom property to the Churchill apartment … they would save over one thousand pounds per year on energy alone. But bear in mind this was calculated using energy prices at the time of filming. Of course prices may rise. Dion is independent. His findings are in line with more holistic studies Churchill themselves conducted, which took all the savings from downsizing into account, not just energy and found downsizing to a Churchill apartment could save someone an average of two thousand three hundred pounds per year … We want to help you make the right decision without the pressure. And ultimately to live without worrying about every penny that you spend … take care and stay warm.” b. The Facebook post, that linked to ad (a), included text that stated, “At Churchill, we understand the importance of living an affordable lifestyle whilst enjoying your way of life. With our new apartment, you can experience both.” The accompanying video featured Dame Esther Rantzen who said, “Join me for a Churchill Retirement living review. As we uncover some of the unseen energy costs around your property. Our energy experts will examine two properties and using their special equipment will reveal any hidden costs.” Two men, the experts, were shown performing tests at a house. One of them said, “What we can see here in the Churchill lodge is these are really well insulated. In the three-bedroom property, when we looked with a thermal camera, we could see that some of those external walls, the temperature of those was matching the temperature of the outside. When it is zero outside all of that heat is going to be sucked out through the fabric of the building.” Dame Esther Rantzen said, “Tune into their findings and to learn why downsizing could save an average of two thousand three hundred pounds per year. Visit Churchill retirement dot co dot uk forward slash cost of living.”","The ASA challenged whether: 1. the claims of saving over one thousand pounds per year in ad (a), were misleading; 2. the claim of saving two thousand three hundred pounds per year in ads (a) and (b) was misleading; and 3. ads (a) and (b) were irresponsible, because they exploited the current cost of living crisis.","1. Churchill Retirement Living Ltd (Churchill) said the £1,000 annual energy cost savings were calculated by sustainability consultants. Churchill provided a full breakdown of the consultants’ figures which they explained were based on scientific testing and analysis carried out while ad (a) was being filmed. They said the three-bedroom house chosen for filming in the ad was a typical three-bedroom semi-detached house in Berkshire built 50 years ago. They attached comments from the sustainability consultants explaining that the property was an end of terrace house and their research supported the conclusion that this was the most common type of property. In addition, the sustainability consultants’ believed the results from the property were typical for a property of that age and condition, if not slightly better. They acknowledged there was subjectivity around whether the three-bedroom property in the video was an average one. However, they believed they had taken reasonable steps to ensure the property was reasonably typical of the wider UK housing stock in terms of age, condition and history. They provided the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for the property. Churchill said their apartment used in the filming was from their Oscar Lodge development in Aylesbury, which was representative of their wider property portfolio. They explained they built very standardised one- and two-bedroom apartments across the country which met almost identical specifications. So, energy efficiency for all their properties was similar. On that basis they believed their property in the ad was a fair representation of an average Churchill property. Churchill explained that the tests in both properties were conducted on the same date (late November) and in similar locations and so the outdoor temperature and weather conditions were suitably similar to make a fair comparison. 2. Churchill explained that the £2,300 per year overall cost saving figure was based on a wider analysis of government EPC data, their own service charge data and additional costs every household would have incurred. They provided supporting documentation to explain how the £2,300 figure had been generated. Churchill explained that they had contrasted two typical dwellings (a three-bedroom house and a four-bedroom house) against properties on three of their developments. They had defined a “typical dwelling” as one with a D rated EPC because in England and Wales the average energy rating was D. They explained that other organisations, such as Ofgem, may look at a typical household when it came to energy use. However, those statistics would incorporate new build houses which would perform better than a “typical dwelling”. The comparison in the ad was only against a “typical dwelling”. They said from their experience their “typical customer” would have lived in a three- or four-bedroom property for many years and therefore the average energy use in that property would be significantly higher. They explained regarding their own properties used in the comparison that they had looked at average EPC data for each of three developments and picked properties where that data was as close a match as possible to the average for that development. 3. Churchill said that the cost of living crisis was a topic that had been in the media for many months. While it affected people of all ages, they believed older people, who may have been living in larger properties, no longer suited to their needs, and whose running costs were high due to global and national events, would be particularly concerned about it. They therefore wanted to provide a solution. The ads were intended to educate the audience about how downsizing to a smaller, more energy efficient property could help save money. Churchill explained phrases such as “rocketing bills” and “power hungry appliances” were common in the media, due to the cost of living crisis. In addition, the ads moved quickly from those references to offering a solution. They said car manufacturers had for a long time promoted the financial benefits of switching to a car that was more efficient and cheaper to run. They believed it was therefore reasonable to do the same for housing when bills were so high that the government had to intervene. On that basis they said that the ads were not irresponsible or likely to cause fear or distress. Churchill said that the ads were no longer appearing because they had been part of a seasonal campaign for winter 2022 which was no longer running.","1. Upheld From references in ad (a) to saving “one thousand one hundred and sixty per year” and “over one thousand pounds per year” the ASA understood that consumers would interpret the claims to mean that they could expect to save on average over £1,000 on energy costs when moving from a typical UK property to any Churchill apartment. The energy savings claims had been generated by sustainability consultants who were independent of Churchill. They had compared a three-bedroom semi-detached house, featured in the video, to one of Churchill’s apartments. They had picked the non-Churchill property on the basis that it had been average building stock and reflected typical outcomes for a property of that age and type. We were satisfied, from the EPC certificate, that it was reasonably representative of average UK housing. In addition, the Churchill property picked for the comparison was from their Aylesbury development, where all properties had B rated EPCs, which did reflect the average for Churchill housing nationwide. However, we understood that while the majority of Churchill apartments had a B rated EPC, not all their apartments were B rated and even particular developments were not B rated overall. In addition, we understood that the Churchill apartment used for the comparison was part of their Aylesbury development that was powered by a ground source heat pump. Energy costs for the ground source heat pump were considerably more efficient than other Churchill developments, such as those that were served by electricity in conjunction with solar energy. We understood why Churchill had used their B rated property for the comparison in the ad. However, we were concerned that without further explanatory information about the energy source and the energy rating of the Churchill property, consumers would be misled into thinking that a move to a Churchill property or Churchill development could save them over £1,000 in energy costs when downsizing from a non-Churchill property, when a switch to a lower energy rated or different energy sourced Churchill property or development would not save that amount. Without further explanation to contextualise the comparisons between the Churchill and non-Churchill housing, the ad and specifically the energy saving claim of over £1,000 in the ad, was likely to mislead. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.9 (Qualification). 2. Upheld From references in ad (a) and (b) to saving “two thousand three hundred pounds per year” downsizing overall, we understood that consumers would interpret the claims in the ads to mean that they could expect to save in the region of £2,300 on all costs when moving from a typical UK property to any Churchill apartment. Churchill had generated the £2,300 savings figure by calculating the average savings from three scenarios. They had contrasted an average one- and two-bedroom Churchill apartment against a non-Churchill three-bedroom property and a four-bedroom property respectively. In a third scenario Churchill had compared a typical two-bedroom Churchill apartment against the three-bedroom property. In all three scenarios results showed a saving from downsizing to a Churchill property. We considered the calculations provided by Churchill, which took into account potential for savings on home insurance and Council Tax, as well as bills not influenced by property size, such as TV licence and broadband. The calculations also incorporated the service charge and ground rent costs for Churchill properties and the estimated costs for repairs and maintenance in the non-Churchill homes. Finally, there were the gas and electric bills. Churchill had estimated that consumers would save between £2,260 and £2,740 moving from a non-Churchill home to a Churchill apartment. While there were extra costs moving to a Churchill apartment, such as the service charge, and so overall the saving was only £2,300, the biggest individual saving within the calculations moving to a Churchill home was on gas and electricity. Churchill had calculated the gas and electricity usage for all properties using publicly available EPC data and the current cost of gas and electricity. They compared results from one three-bedroom property and one four-bedroom property, energy rated D, as that was the national average for properties in England and Wales. Regarding the Churchill apartments used for the savings comparison, Churchill had taken two of their representative apartments from each energy source they used (electricity and solar, ground source heat pump and air source heat pump) from three separate developments. The six properties in total had B rated EPCs because that was the average for Churchill apartments. Concerning the non-Churchill properties used in the savings comparison we noted that the estimated gas and electric use, based on their calculation from the EPC, for the three-bedroom house was 24,255 kWh and for the four-bedroom house it was 27,560 kWh. We understood that Ofgem on their website stated that a medium energy use house (a two- to three-bedroom property, with two to three people living in it) would generate a typical gas and electricity use of 14,200 kWh. For a high energy household (a four or more bedroom house with four to five people living in it) would generate a typical gas and electricity use of 21,100 kWh. Therefore, the homes picked by Churchill as a comparison did not seem representative of the national average. Churchill had explained that the Ofgem figures were based on “typical households”, which included new build houses that would be significantly more efficient than “typical dwellings”. A typical dwelling, used in Churchill’s comparison, would have a D rated EPC. However, the exact basis of the comparison had not been made clear in the ad and in the absence of further information, consumers would interpret the savings claim to be against an average property, which could have been reflected by the Ofgem figures. Both properties they had picked, by Churchill’s calculations, used significantly more energy than an average high energy household as defined by Ofgem and in the case of the four-bedroom house used almost double the energy of a medium energy house. We therefore considered that the properties used for the calculation, which made up the biggest individual saving moving to a Churchill apartment, were not representative and the ad would require clear qualification to explain the basis of the calculation for consumers to understand it. We further noted that while the Churchill properties used for the electric and gas calculations seemed fairly representative for the ground source and air source heat pump developments, the average energy use of the two apartments they had chosen for the electricity with solar development were 25% lower than the average property at that development. That was significant because properties using electricity with solar, generated over double the cost than that of those using ground source and air source heat pumps, according to the calculations. On that basis, the properties used for the comparisons between the Churchill and non-Churchill housing were not representative and the resulting claimed saving of £2,300 featured in ads (a) and (b), was likely to mislead. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.9 (Qualification). 3. Upheld in relation to ad (a) only Marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society and must not cause fear or distress without justifiable reason. Ad (b) referred to the balance between enjoying life, but doing so affordably. The accompanying video made clear that living in older houses could cost consumers money on bills, for reasons they might not immediately be aware of. The ad proposed that by downsizing to a Churchill home could save consumers money on their bills and therefore allow them to enjoy their life affordably. The example in ad (b), of all the heat being sucked out of a building due to poor insulation, was a bold claim that could cause consternation for some. Further to that, references to “hidden” and “unseen” energy costs in the ad had the potential to cause concern. However, the language used was measured and not excessive. While the ad did make reference to uncovering “ energy costs around your property”, and therefore could have been seen as referring to all houses, it was clear that the property chosen, was only an example and that energy efficiency would vary from house to house. In addition the ad did not imply that all properties had the same problems as the one in the video or at least to the same degree and the fact that some level of energy inefficiency existed in all houses was likely to be widely understood.Ad (a) contained a longer video. The video was entitled, “Churchill Retirement Living – Saving Energy Costs with Esther Rantzen – Cost of Living” and text on the website said it was part of a, “cost of living mini-feature”. Therefore, it would have been interpreted in that context. The video talked about the current consequences of rising living costs on older people. It explained how bills had confronted people with a new challenge and highlighted the stress a stretched budget could bring. The ad explained that a Churchill survey found one in four retirees had gone back to work due to pressure about their increased monthly expenses. It asked what people could do to live well and protect their retirement pot, without the “drastic” decision to go back to work and giving up the freedom of retirement. A Churchill resident was interviewed and explained that if she still lived in her old house, she would have rationed her heating. The video warned that energy bills could continue to rise and that consumers “should not have to watch every penny”. The ad promoted downsizing to a Churchill home as a solution to rising bills, by highlighting the energy costs and savings that could be made by doing so. While the video did offer suggestions on how to make homes more energy efficient, they were strongly caveated with advice to seeking professional help. The ad advised homeowners, that doing work themselves was unwise or even dangerous and that work on a home could run into thousands of pounds. References to “draughty doorways”, “cold corners”, “power hungry appliances” and “rocketing bills”, added to the impression that running a home was likely to be costly. The underlying messages of the ad, energy efficiency and consideration of bills in a time of rising prices, were not in isolation problematic, even when used in the context of the cost of living crisis. However, Churchill’s ad discussed these issues using a narrative that strongly focused on the concerns of older people, such as rationing heating, having to go back to work or relying on savings to pay bills. Further, it warned that the things could get worse through future higher energy bills. That negative message was then compounded by images of houses leaking heat and money, and positioning the primary alternative for moving to a Churchill property, and that making improvements to existing homes, as costly, potentially dangerous and overall, an onerous process. For those reasons ad (a) was likely to cause fear or distress without justifiable reason and therefore was irresponsible. On that point ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Compliance) and 4.2 (Harm and offence). We also investigated ad (b) under those rules, but did not find it in breach.","Ads (a) and (b) must not appear again in their current form. Savings claims must be supported by robust evidence and appropriately qualified. In addition, ads must be prepared with a sense of responsibility and should not cause fear or distress without justifiable reason.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/churchill-retirement-living-ltd-a23-1192106-churchill-retirement-living-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on LifeSafe Technologies Ltd,,"Two paid-for TikTok ads for the StaySafe All-in-One fire extinguisher: a. The first ad, seen on 27 August 2023, featured a man and woman in bed discussing the product. The man stated, “It’s big enough to deal with any fire […] It’s easily used and tackles fire in seconds […] It’s the StaySafe All-in-One fire extinguisher.” b. The second ad, seen on 25 August 2023, featured a woman using the fire extinguisher to extinguish a fire on an electric multi-socket extension lead. She stated, “That is unreal. How’s it work so fast? This is the StaySafe All-in-One fire extinguisher. Buy a few of these now.”","Two complainants, who understood that no fire extinguisher was suitable for all sizes and types of fires and that the product was not suitable for electrical fires, challenged whether the ads were misleading.","LifeSafe Technologies Ltd believed the claims “It’s big enough to deal with any fire” and “It’s easily used and tackles fire in seconds” in ad (a) were not misleading because the product had been tested and proven to extinguish fires caused by electrical, wood, cooking oils, textiles, petrol/diesel, paper/card, motor oil and bioethanol products. They said the StaySafe All-in-One was specially formulated to be effective in extinguishing electrical fires up to 1000 V, as was shown in ad (b), and that it extinguished lithium-ion battery fires. LifeSafe Technologies said they had worked with the British Standards Institute (BSI) to ensure the product was fully tested and approved. That included the product passing the relevant specification tests to ensure the claims made in both ads (a) and (b) were accurate. They said the product was produced to Finite Element Analysis (FEA) standards, was BSI 5597 test compliant and that the fluid used in the extinguisher was BSI tested, which ensured it worked effectively on A, B and F Class fires as well as lithium and di-electric fires. They also said the product was EN3 tested, which was a standard for portable fire extinguishers set by the European Committee for Standardisation.","Upheld The ASA considered the claim that the product was “All-in-One” was likely to be interpreted by consumers to mean the product was effective at putting out all types of fires that were likely to occur in a domestic setting. Furthermore, we considered that consumers were likely to interpret the claims in ad (a) “big enough to deal with any fire” and “easily used and tackles fires in seconds”, as shown within the context of a home, to mean that it was extremely effective in extinguishing any type or size of fire which could realistically occur in a domestic setting. We considered consumers would also understand from the video of a woman extinguishing an electrical fire in ad (b) that the product was effective in tackling fires caused by electrical appliances. We therefore assessed whether the product could extinguish all types and sizes of fires typically seen in domestic settings, including electrical fires. We understood that fire safety organisations recognised six classifications of fire: A, B, C, D, Electrical fires and Class F fires. Different types of flammable materials were listed for each of those classifications, in particular combustible materials (A), flammable liquids (B), flammable gases (C), flammable metals (D), electrical equipment (E) and cooking oils/fats (F). We therefore expected to see evidence to show that the StaySafe All-in-One product could efficiently extinguish fires caused by each of those materials, including specific certifications for each classification of fire. While we acknowledged LifeSafe Technologies’ comments regarding the testing of their product and the certifications that had been issued to it, they had not provided any evidence to support their position. We also noted that they said the product could only work safely on electrical fires up to 1000 V, which therefore meant it could not deal with any fire, as claimed in ad (a). Because we considered the ads gave the impression that the product was effective at putting out all types and sizes of domestic fires and was an “All-in-One” home fire extinguisher, and we had not seen evidence to show that was the case, we concluded that the ads were misleading. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.11 (Exaggeration).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told LifeSafe Technologies Ltd to ensure that future ads did not state or imply their fire extinguishers were suitable for all sizes and types of domestic fires, including electrical fires, unless they held adequate substantiation for those claims.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/lifesafe-technologies-ltd-g23-1212656-lifesafe-technologies-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Lynne McTaggart,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","Two marketing emails and a website, www.lynnemctaggart.com, for the alternative medicine advocate and author Lynne McTaggart: a. An email for an online event promoting Ms McTaggart’s “Power of Eight” method, received on 23 February 2023, contained the subject line “Healed in an Instant: Supersize your intentions to transform your life”. Text in the main body stated “Join me for a special two-hour online event, 'Healed in an instant: Supersize your intentions to transform your life' and discover the secret of how group intention and the Power of Eight unleashes a miraculous power to heal yourself, your loved ones […] During this workshop about the Power of Eight, you’ll hear and see documented cases of […] paralysis, crippling arthritis, cataracts, multiple sclerosis, genetic liver disease, depression, chronic fatigue, and much more – all being healed just through people sending their loving thoughts in a group.” b. A page on the advertiser’s website promoting a paid-for five-day retreat called “Heal Your Past”, seen on 30 March 2023. Text stated “A HEALING RETREAT IN A HISTORIC ENGLISH COUNTRY HOUSE SANCTUARY”. Text continued “[…] Time-Light is now being used by a team of European therapists to heal such problems as depression and anxiety […] Lynne will then work with you using her special techniques backward and forward in time, using the supersizing healing power of a Power of Eight group to heal specific incidents from your past that prevent you from living life to your full potential.”","The Good Thinking Society challenged whether: 1. the claims that the “Power of Eight” method could heal paralysis, crippling arthritis, cataracts, multiple sclerosis, genetic liver disease, depression, and chronic fatigue in ad (a) were misleading and could be substantiated; 2. the claim that the “Time-Light” method could heal problems such as depression and anxiety in ad (b) was misleading and could be substantiated; and 3. ads (a) and (b) discouraged essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought.","1. Lynne McTaggart said that the “Healed in an Instant” online event promoted in ad (a) had been broadcast from the USA, and the ad had been sent to her international audience as a courtesy. She said that she considered herself to be a science and medical author and journalist, and not an alternative medicine advocate. Ms McTaggart believed that the claims identified in the ad were not medical claims, and that she had never claimed the techniques found in the “Power of Eight” method could heal people of medical conditions. She said the text from ad (a) meant that during the online event she would present testimonial videos from people suffering from the conditions identified in the ad, who, after working with their “Power of Eight” group, had reported that their conditions had improved or healed. She said that the only claim she had ever made was that group intention appeared to have an effect, the extent of which was still being investigated. Ms McTaggart said that the people mentioned in ad (a) had all been under the care of doctors and other medical practitioners, who had deemed their conditions incurable by conventional means. She said that they had continued to receive medical care from their doctors during and after any work with “The Power of Eight” method. She said that each person had given their approval for the videos to be presented, and that she had received numerous testimonials from users of the method. 2. Ms McTaggart believed that the complainant had conflated a statement of fact - that her “Time-Light” method was being used by a team of European psychotherapists and psychiatrists to heal such problems as depression and anxiety – with a medical claim. She said that the “Time-Light” method was being used as a therapeutic tool at a psychiatric clinic in Germany, which had reported positive results. She said that the text of ad (b) did not claim that the “Time-Light” method had been used as the exclusive therapy in treating those patients, and had merely stated that it was one of the treatments used at the clinic. Ms McTaggart said that she and her organisation had not claimed to heal anxiety or depression themselves using the “Time-Light” method. She said the wider language seen in the ad was metaphorical, and the healing referred to was not medical, and did not address anxiety, depression or other mental or physical conditions. She said that the “Time-Light” method sat in the realm of personal development, not medical treatment. 3. Ms McTaggart said that she and her organisation had never advised anyone to stop conventional medical treatment, did not present the “Power of Eight” method as a replacement for any therapy, and that during the course she recommended people focus on finding the right medical practitioner for their situation. She said that the “Power of Eight” method provided a platform which allowed people working within a group to help each other and themselves. She said that she was not present within any such groups when the work was carried out, and had never made any specific claims about the method. She said that was made clear in the terms of use found on her website, which clearly stated that she was not a medical practitioner, did not make specific health claims for the “Power of Eight” method, and advised consumers that the method was designed to complement, not replace, professional medical treatment.","1. Upheld Ad (a) promoted an online event called “Healed in an instant: Supersize your intentions to transform your life”, which was a workshop promoting Lynne McTaggart’s group intention method, the “Power of Eight”. The ad encouraged consumers to “discover the secret of how group intention and the Power of Eight unleashes a miraculous power to heal yourself [and] your loved ones”, and contained the claim that attendees would “hear and see documented cases of […] paralysis, crippling arthritis, cataracts, multiple sclerosis, genetic liver disease, depression, chronic fatigue, and much more – all being healed just through people sending their loving thoughts in a group.” The ASA considered that consumers would understand from that claim that the workshop would present them with documented examples and case studies of people suffering from the identified illnesses and conditions, who had been healed as a direct result of “Power of Eight” group members “sending their loving thoughts in a group”. We therefore expected to see robust scientific evidence in support of the claims made about the “Power of Eight” method, which substantiated that it provided successful treatment for the listed illnesses and conditions. Testimonials alone were not sufficient to substantiate the claims. Because the ad stated that attendees would “hear and see documented cases” of the listed illnesses and conditions “all being healed just through people sending their loving thoughts in a group”, we considered that it had made medical claims that the techniques promoted in the method could heal people of such conditions. We therefore considered that the ad presented the “Power of Eight” method as a cure to the listed illnesses and conditions. While we acknowledged Ms McTaggart’s offer to provide us with copies of the video testimonials from people who had used the “Power of Eight” method, we did not consider testimonials alone were sufficient to substantiate the medical claims made in the ad. Because we had seen no evidence that the “Power of Eight” group intention method could provide effective treatment for paralysis, crippling arthritis, cataracts, multiple sclerosis, genetic liver disease, depression and chronic fatigue, we concluded that the claims had not been substantiated and were misleading. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 2. Upheld Ad (b) promoted a paid-for retreat at which attendees would be taught the “Time-Light” method, and included the claim that the method was “being used by a team of European therapists to heal such problems as depression and anxiety”. We therefore considered that consumers would understand from that claim that the “Time-Light” method could heal depression and anxiety. We also considered that the claim that the method could “heal” depression and anxiety to be a medical claim. We therefore expected that Ms McTaggart should hold robust scientific evidence in support of the claims made about the “Time-Light” method, which substantiated that it provided successful treatment for depression and anxiety. We acknowledged Ms McTaggart’s response, including her comments that the “Time-Light” method was being used in a clinical setting in Germany, and her belief that the ad had not claimed that it had been used as an exclusive therapy, but only as a treatment option. We also acknowledged her belief that the ad had not claimed that the method could heal anxiety or depression. However, the ad had clearly stated “Time-Light is now being used by a team of European therapists to heal such problems as depression and anxiety” and had presented no qualifying information or evidence to substantiate that claim. The only information provided by Ms McTaggart was that feedback from the German clinic had reported “positive results”. Because we had seen no evidence that the “Time-Light” method could successfully treat depression or anxiety, we concluded that the claim had not been substantiated and was misleading. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 3. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketers must not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. For example, they must not offer specific advice on, diagnosis or treatment for such conditions unless that advice, diagnosis or treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. We noted that ads (a) and (b) included references to paralysis, crippling arthritis, cataracts, multiple sclerosis, genetic liver disease, depression, chronic fatigue and anxiety. We considered that those were conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. Because both ads had made medical claims, we considered that consumers would interpret them to mean that the online workshop advertised in ad (a) and the retreat advertised in ad (b) would offer specific advice or treatment for those conditions. While we acknowledged Ms McTaggart’s response, and her belief that the ads did not make any specific health claims, we considered that the claims made in both ads implied that the advertised methods offered specific treatment for the illnesses and conditions mentioned, and therefore considered that it was her responsibility to demonstrate that the specific treatments mentioned in the ads were conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified health professional. We had not seen any evidence to demonstrate that this was the case. Ms McTaggart had not supplied evidence which showed that either the “Power of Eight” or the “Time-Light” methods advertised in ads (a) and (b) were conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. We therefore concluded that the ads discouraged essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought and that they breached the Code.

ASA Ruling on Reclaim My PPI Tax Ltd t/a Reclaim My PPI Tax,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on PPI tax rebate advertising. See also a related ruling published on 31 January 2024. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Three paid-for Facebook ads for Reclaim My PPI Tax, a PPI tax rebate company, seen in April 2023: a. The first ad stated “Thousands of UK residents are being refunded tax. You could be eligible to make a claim if you have ever received a PPI refund. Could you have a claim?” Further text in a green text box stated “HMRC Refunds. HMRC Is Refunding Brits Right Now … £Millions Already Claimed. Check in 60 seconds. Check For Your Refund” and “Claim Your Share Of Over £38 Billion”. b. The second ad stated “Successful PPI claimants are discovering they could be owed an extra payment. HMRC does not automatically refund overpaid PPI tax. Find out if you could be due money in seconds”. An image of a crown was included alongside text that stated “HMRC Refunds”. Further text stated “HMRC Is Paying Out. Average claim: £3000”, followed by a bullet-pointed list that stated “HMRC is refunding. Only takes 60 seconds. Helps with the cost of living. Find Out For Free”. c. The third ad stated “Thousands of UK residents are being refunded tax. You could be eligible to make a claim if you have ever received a PPI refund. Could you have a claim?” An image with a crown was included, with text that said “HMRC Refunds. Tax Rebate Available. Average Claim: £3000”, followed by a bullet-pointed list that stated “Help with cost of living. 60 second process. It’s free to check. Check Now” and “Claim Your Share Of Over £38 Billion”.",The ASA challenged whether the ads: 1. misleadingly implied they were from HMRC or for an official government service; and 2. (b) and (c) irresponsibly took advantage of peoples’ concerns about the cost of living crisis.,Reclaim My PPI Tax said the ads were no longer being used and they had not received complaints directly from customers. They explained that it had never been their intention to invoke peoples’ concerns about the cost of living crisis and would consider this possible interpretation when creating future ads.,"1. & 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not claim that the marketer (or any other entity referred to), the marketing communication or the advertised product had been approved, endorsed or authorised by any public or other body if it had not. We understood Reclaim My PPI Tax assisted consumers in claiming tax deducted from statutory interest paid alongside payment protection insurance (PPI) refunds. Reclaim My PPI Tax charged a fee for completing the relevant form and contacting HMRC about the tax rebate. There was no official or approved third-party body for issuing such tax rebates. The ads were seen in the context of widespread news coverage about the increasing cost of living. That coverage included a focus on high inflation, which had affected the affordability of goods and services for households and had left some people struggling financially. All ads included references to “HMRC” and “HMRC Refunds”. Additionally, ad (a) stated “HMRC is Refunding Brits right now”, and ad (b) stated “HMRC is Paying Out”. Ads (b) and (c) included an image of a crown, the same as that used on UK government websites and social media channels. Ads (a) and (c) also made reference to “UK residents”. We considered that presentation and text gave the impression the ads had come from, or had been endorsed by, an official government body. However, we understood the ads had not been endorsed or approved by any official body. Ads (b) and (c) also stated “Helps with the cost of living”. We considered that risked exploiting some consumers’ concerns about their finances and contributed to the impression those ads were from an official government source that could help with the increased cost of living. Because the ads gave the impression they had been endorsed or approved by an official government body when they had not, and because ads (b) and (c) took advantage of concerns about the cost of living crisis, we considered they likely to mislead and were irresponsible, respectively, and had therefore breached the Code. On point 1, ads (a), (b), and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), and 3.50 (Endorsements and testimonials). On point 2, ads (b) and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).",The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Reclaim My PPI Tax Ltd to ensure that future ads did not give the impression they had been approved or endorsed by a government body if that was not the case. We also told them to ensure that future ads were prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and society.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/reclaim-my-ppi-tax-ltd-a23-1196059-reclaim-my-ppi-tax-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Team RH Fitness Ltd,,"A TikTok video for Team RH, posted on 25 July 2023 on the teamrh.uk TikTok account featured a man responding to the question “Do you do a free trial before committing?” to which he responded “No, it’s £6.99. If I give you a trial it’s like giving you your calories, your macros, your full training programme, access to all the recipes, and you could be like oh yeah that was a nice trial that I’ve got the full plan now I’m gonna fuck off.” The caption stated “no trial, it’s £6.99 #weightlossplan #dietplan”.",Two complainants challenged whether the ad made it clear that the subscription was for a minimum term of 12 months.,Team RH Fitness Ltd t/a Team RH did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"Upheld The ASA was concerned by Team RH’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. We considered that consumers would interpret the claim “No, it’s £6.99” together with the caption “no trial, it’s £6.99” to mean that the price they would pay for access to the product was £6.99. The ad did not include any references to that being the price per month or to the minimum term required to sign up for the subscription. We understood, however, that Team RH subscriptions required a minimum commitment of 12 months. We further understood that to download the programme, consumers were asked to waive their right to a 14-day cooling off period. Therefore, the minimum price consumers would pay for the Team RH programme was £83.88. Because the ad did not make clear that the minimum period for the subscription was 12 months, we considered that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification), and 3.17 (Prices).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Team RH Fitness Ltd t/a Team RH to ensure that they did not mislead consumers by omitting to mention that the subscription was for a minimum period of 12 months.

ASA Ruling on AGA Rangemaster Ltd t/a AGA,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A website for AGA, www.agaliving.com, a retailer of heat-storage cookers, seen on 28 June 2023, included a webpage for the AGA eR7 Series. Text stated “The AGA eR7 Series range offers the lowest running costs for any heat-storage cast-iron range cooker, as this cooker is fully programmable for the most efficient operation.”",Everhot Ltd challenged whether the claim “the lowest running costs for any heat-storage cast-iron range cooker” was: 1. misleading and could be substantiated; and 2. verifiable.,"1. & 2. AGA Rangemaster Ltd t/a AGA said all AGA products were heat-storage appliances with heat store ovens. AGA acknowledged that their main competitor was Everhot, but believed that their products were not directly comparable. They explained that unlike other AGA models, the electric range of ovens (the eR range) was designed differently, which allowed them to be switched off when not in use. The eR7 heated up quickly, and therefore did not require the cooker to be left on all the time. As such, AGA believed the operation of the eR range of cookers differed from Everhot’s products which were recommended to remain on. Whilst both were described as cast-iron heat-storage ovens, AGA said they extensively used cast-iron in their ovens and it featured in the majority of the parts of their appliances of which approximately 62% by weight was cast-iron, but Everhot products only used cast-iron on the doors and hotplates, of which approximately 11% by weight was cast-iron. AGA explained that they had tested Everhot models, but did not publish information about the running cost of those products because it was commercially sensitive information. However, they provided us with the power consumption of different Everhot products when in “ECO” mode, as was available on the Everhot website. Whilst they re-iterated that the Everhot products were not directly comparable to the AGA eR7 range, they highlighted that the most comparable Everhot products were the Everhot 100+ and 110 because of their dimensions, and because the eR7 and Everhot 100+ and 110 models similarly had three ovens, a hot plate and a simmer plate. The power consumption data for those Everhot appliances was 90 kilowatt per hour (kWh) when “ECO” mode was applied overnight, and based on that, AGA estimated that they would consume more power when in use. They provided data for the eR7 that showed the different functions of the cooker and the amount of energy used and the cost to run. They said in the event that an AGA eR7 was left on all week, the roasting oven would use approximately 82 kWH, the baking oven would use 50 kWh, and the simmering oven would use 28 kWh, which they believed demonstrated that the eR7 range required less energy than both the Everhot 100+ and 110. Therefore, because their products could be turned off when not in use, AGA believed they offered consumers the chance to achieve the lowest running costs. Lastly, they confirmed that they had not received complaints from consumers directly since changing the website to provide a breakdown of the running costs of all of their AGA products.","1. Upheld The ad stated “the AGA eR7 offers the lowest running costs for any heat-storage cast-iron range cooker”. The ASA understood that the purpose of heat-storage range cookers differed from a standard oven, and that they were designed to store and distribute heat in a way so that they could be left on all the time. We considered that consumers would be aware of that feature and interpret “heat-storage cast-iron range cooker” to mean a range cooker, that used cast-iron in its design, and did not have to be turned off when not in use. We also considered consumers would interpret “lowest running costs” as a comparative claim; namely, that the eR7 used the least amount of energy, and therefore had the lowest associated running costs, of all other heat-storage cast-iron range cookers. We further noted that the claim was qualified by the text “as this cooker is fully programmable for the most efficient option”. We considered that, within the context of the ad, it was not clear what “fully programmable” meant, and that it could have been understood to refer to a number of programmable options, such as the different cooking functions offered by the oven, the ability to adjust the temperature, or that it was possible to turn the range cooker off when not in use. Because of that, we considered consumers would not understand the basis of the “lowest running cost” claim. In the absence of further qualifying information, consumers would expect the claim to refer to the cost of running the different functions of the cooker, and not a reference to the savings made over time. We first assessed whether the AGA eR7 was comparable with Everhot cookers in the context of the claim. We understood that both AGA and Everhot cookers used a mixture of cast-iron and steel in their designs. In both models, the hotplates and doors were made from cast-iron; however, in the AGA eR7 model, the ovens were also made from cast-iron, whereas the ovens in Everhot cookers were made from steel. Because we considered that consumers would not expect a cast-iron range cooker to be comprised entirely of cast-iron, we considered that they were sufficiently similar to be compared. We also understood that both were heat-storage cookers, since they used radiant heat stored in the cooker to heat and cook food. We therefore considered that they would both be understood as cast-iron heat-storage range cookers by consumers and that their running costs could be compared. We next assessed the running cost data that had been provided by AGA for the eR7 in comparison with the data Everhot had provided for their 110i model. Everhot provided the energy use of the 110i at its cooking temperature across all functions for seven days, as well as the energy use for seven days with the “ECO” setting applied, which allowed the cooker to turn off for a period overnight before returning to cooking temperature during the day. Everhot did not provide the running cost data for every cooking feature of the 110i model, but we were provided with the energy use for the hotplate and the top oven, which was the hottest oven. We therefore compared the data for the hottest ovens at their respective cooking temperatures and the hotplates at their respective cooking temperatures. We also compared the total energy use for the range cookers with all hotplates and ovens on and for both cookers in ECO mode over seven days. The running cost data was based on the assumption that electricity cost 30 pence per kWh. We understood that the cost of electricity per kW fluctuated over time and that the exact running cost of both appliances could differ from the data supplied to us. However, because the running cost data for both appliances were based on the same cost of electricity, we considered that they were comparable.The data showed that having only the hot plate on full power on the AGA eR7 used 0.600 kWh, and that this would cost 18p per hour to run. In comparison, the data for the Everhot 110i model showed that the hot plate and simmer plate being on full power used 0.220 kWh and that would cost 6.6p per hour to run. Even though the Everhot data also included the use of the simmering plate, we understood that the Everhot 110i model used less energy than the AGA eR7, and therefore considered that the Everhot model was more efficient in its energy use for the hotplate function. The data also showed that the hottest oven of the AGA eR7 used 0.450 kWh, which cost 13.5p per hour to run. The equivalent function for the Everhot 110i model used 0.410 kWh and cost 12.3p per hour to run. Again, we understood from the data that the Everhot was more efficient in its energy use for the hottest oven function. Because of that, we did not consider that the data demonstrated the AGA eR7 had the lowest running costs of any cast-iron heat-storage range cooker. We next evaluated the running costs for both range cookers with all oven and hotplates having been left on continuously for seven days. The data showed that the AGA eR7 used 252 kWh, whereas the Everhot 110i model used 116.41 kWh. Whilst we acknowledged that was not necessarily reflective of typical consumer use, and that it was unlikely the hot plates would be left on continuously for seven days, we considered it was indicative of the running costs across all functions of the two cookers. Because the data showed that the Everhot model used significantly less energy over a seven-day period than the AGA eR7, we considered that demonstrated the AGA eR7 was the less energy efficient appliance based on continuous use of all functions. We then assessed the running costs for both range cookers in their respective ECO modes over a seven-day period. Both the AGA eR7 and the Everhot 110i had a mode which enabled the temperature to be automatically lowered overnight before returning to cooking temperature the following day. The data provided by AGA showed how much energy the eR7 used when in its ECO mode continuously for seven days. The data showed that per hour, the eR7 used 0.347 kWh per hour and that the Everhot 110i model used 0.531kWh per hour. As such, we understood that the eR7 used less energy when in ECO mode than the Everhot 110i model. However, since that was an “eco” mode designed to be used when the cooker was not being used to cook, it did not in itself demonstrate it would have the lowest running costs as it would be used by consumers. We acknowledged AGA’s argument that, in comparison to other AGA products, the eR7 was designed to be switched off when not in use or could be put in ECO mode which used less energy, and so would allow consumers to make greater savings over time. However, we were not provided with the daily running costs for a typical day that showed usage of the AGA eR7 with all functions on and at their cooking temperatures during the day and ECO mode at night, in comparison with the Everhot 110i model over the same period. As such, we could not determine the extent to which the ECO mode, or being switched on and off, impacted the typical energy use of the AGA eR7 and whether that would sufficiently reduce the running costs of the cooker to substantiate that the eR7 model had the lowest running costs of any cast-iron range cooker. In any case, we considered consumers would not have expected the lowest running costs claim to refer to savings accrued over time by using an ECO mode function or by switching it off when not in use. Rather that it referred to the actual running cost of the different functions of the range cooker. Because the Everhot was more energy efficient when in use, we considered that the data supplied by AGA was not sufficient to substantiate the claim. Furthermore, we noted that AGA did not provide us with the running costs for any other cast-iron heat-storage range cookers. Because the claim was likely to be understood by consumers as a comparison with all other cast-iron ranges, and we only received evidence related to two models from Everhot, we considered that the data supplied was not sufficient to substantiate the claim. For those reasons, we considered the data was not sufficient to substantiate that the AGA eR7 had the lowest running costs of any heat-storage cast-iron range cooker, and concluded the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that comparisons with identifiable competitors must be verifiable. That meant that an ad which featured a comparison with an identifiable competitor or competitors needed to include, or direct its audience to, sufficient information to allow them to understand the comparison, and be able to check the claims were accurate, or ask someone suitably qualified to do so. We considered what would constitute sufficient information to enable consumers or competitors to verify the ad’s comparative claim “the AGA eR7 offers the lowest running costs for any heat-storage cast-iron range cooker”. We considered that for the claim to be verifiable, the running costs of the eR7 and all competitor heat-storage cast-iron range cookers would need to be made available in an accessible format. We also considered information would be required about the methodology used to calculate these running costs, including information about the settings the cookers were run on for the individual functions such as the hotplate and hottest oven, along with the cost per hour and the cost per week to run the various features of these cookers. The ad did not include any information or data to compare the running costs with other heat-storage cast-iron range cookers, neither did it direct them to where that could be obtained. As such, the ad did not allow consumers or competitors to verify the comparison and we concluded the ad breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.35 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told AGA Rangemaster Ltd t/a AGA not to claim the eR7 had the lowest running costs of any heat-storage cast-iron range cooker in the absence of adequate substantiation. We also told them to ensure that ads provided sufficient information to enable consumers and competitors to verify comparisons with identifiable competitors or adequately signposted the audience to such information.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/aga-rangemaster-ltd-a23-1203542-aga-rangemaster-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Gamehaus Network Technology Co Ltd,,"An in-app ad for the mobile game Whispers: Interactive Romance Stories, seen on 30 October 2023 in the mobile game app Virtual Families 3. The ad featured an animated scene of a blindfolded woman kneeling on the floor while a man standing in front of her held her face in his hand. A speech bubble appeared which was labelled “Niece”. She said to him, “Uncle, please punish me.” On-screen text then appeared which stated “20 years ago”. The scene cut to the woman as a young child at a funfair. She said, “Uncle, this place is so fun!” He held out his arms, lifted her into the air and nuzzled into her cheek. She said to him, “Uncle, I will marry you when I grow up!” The ad then returned to the opening scene with the woman blindfolded in a kneeling position and her statement, “Uncle, please punish me.” Two buttons appeared: “Accept” and “Reject”. An animated finger reached out from the bottom of the screen as though it was going to press the “Accept” button and then did the same thing with the “Reject” button.","The complainant who challenged whether, by featuring a potentially incestuous relationship between an uncle and his niece, the ad was offensive and irresponsible.","Gamehaus Network Technology Co Ltd did not respond to the ASA's enquiries.Last Day of Work LLC, publishers of the Virtual Families 3 app in which the ad was seen, said they would ensure the ad and any similar content from the advertiser would not appear in their games in future.","Upheld The ASA was concerned by Gamehaus Network Technology Co Ltd's lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The ad appeared in the Virtual Families 3 mobile game, which had a PEGI 3 rating meaning it was suitable for people of all ages, including children. It highlighted the relationship between an uncle and his niece. In the first and last scenes, she was portrayed as an adult and was blindfolded in a kneeling position. She said, “Uncle, please punish me.” We considered that consumers would be likely to understand from her blindfolded, kneeling stance and her request to be punished that she appeared willing to engage in sado-masochistic, sexual behaviour with her uncle. We further considered that the flashback to the funfair scene when she was a child and her statement that she would marry her uncle when she was grown up, added to the impression of them having an incestuous relationship and had overtones of a child being viewed as a sexual object and groomed by an adult relative. We concluded that the ad had the effect of portraying a child in a sexual way. Because the ad featured scenes depicting an incestuous relationship between an uncle and his niece, and suggested that a child had been sexualised and groomed by an adult, we concluded it was likely to cause serious and widespread offence in any medium in which it appeared, and portrayed a child in a sexual way and was therefore irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising), 4.1 and 4.8 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Grandbing Technology Co Ltd t/a On Fancy,,"A website for Onfancy, www.onfancy.co.uk, an online clothing retailer seen on 1 November 2023, featured a product listing for a child’s swimsuit. Four images in the ad showed a female child model wearing a one-shoulder swimsuit with a cut out feature on one side at the waist. All the images were cropped to show the model’s face from the mouth downwards and were cut off at thigh level. In three of the images the model’s arm was raised to touch her hair. One image showed the front view of the model with one leg slightly raised. The other three images showed the model in a standing pose viewed from the front, side and back respectively.","The complainant, who believed that the ad portrayed the child model in a sexualised way, challenged whether it was irresponsible and breached the Code.",Grandbing Technology Ltd t/a Onfancy did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"Upheld The ASA was concerned by Onfancy’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. We considered that the model in the ad appeared to be between seven and ten years of age and was definitely under the age of 18.The ad showed images of the model wearing a swimsuit. In the two front view images, the outline of her genitalia appeared to be visible under the swimsuit. We considered that, while that styling may not have been intentional, it was inappropriate and had the effect of sexualising the young model. The images were cropped so that the model’s face was visible only from the mouth downwards. We considered that this anonymised the model and focused the reader’s attention on her body. In the context of an ad for a child’s swimsuit where clothing was limited and tight-fitting, we considered such an approach also had the effect of sexualising the model. In three of the images her arm was raised to touch her hair. In one of the front view images her leg was raised and in the other her legs were slightly apart. In three of the images her head was tilted to the side and she was touching her hair, While not overtly sexual, we considered that the poses had a seductive tone and were quite adult for a model who was clearly under 18. The model also appeared to be wearing red lip gloss, which, emphasised and drew attention to her lips. In the image taken from behind, we considered that the model’s bottom and legs were the main focus and that also had the effect of sexualising her. We considered that those elements in combination had the effect of portraying the model in a sexualised way. Because we considered that the ad depicted a person who appeared to be under the age of 18 in a sexual way, we concluded that it was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising) and 4.8 (Harm and offence).",We told Grandbing Technology Ltd t/a Onfancy to ensure that in future their ads did not portray someone who appeared to be under 18 years of age in a sexualised way.

ASA Ruling on HJ Heinz Foods UK Ltd t/a Heinz,,"The product packaging for Heinz Beanz, seen on 2 August 2023, featured a promotion. Text on the front of the tin stated “FREE DAYZ OUT WITH EVERY PACK”. Text on the back of the tin stated “We could tell you that our Beanz are hard to beat […] Instead, we would like to offer you a day out on us […] Claim your voucher on dayout.heinz.co.uk T&Cs apply”. Next to that was a graphic of a ticket stub with a QR code and text that stated “SCAN TO CLAIM YOUR REWARD HEINZ DAYZ OUT”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad omitted the significant conditions of the promotion.,"HJ Heinz Foods UK Ltd t/a Heinz said their “Free Dayz Out” promotion was advertised on a number of Heinz products between 28 June 2023 and 31 October 2023. The promotion offered consumers who purchased a relevant product the opportunity to apply for a variety of free events and activities. They said the promotional products were all sold within approximately two months of being placed on sale. Heinz said the ad contained clear instructions on how to enter the promotion. As it was significantly limited by space, it directed consumers to an easily accessible alternative source which contained all significant terms and conditions. Scanning the quick-response code (QR code) or following the web address on-pack took consumers to a form that could be completed to redeem entry to the events and activities. To submit the form, consumers had to tick a box confirming they had read the promotion’s terms and conditions. Consumers also had to enter a batch code from the bottom of the tin; no proof of purchase was required. They said the promotion’s significant terms and conditions were below the form and stated “UK, 18+. Opens 28 June 2023. Claim voucher by 31st October 2023. Use voucher by 31st December 2023, unless otherwise stated. One claim per product purchased. Maximum of two claims per person per day”. They said that due to limited space available on the ad it was appropriate to make the terms and conditions of the promotion available on the website.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that promotions must communicate all applicable significant conditions where their omission was likely to mislead. Significant conditions may, depending on the circumstances, include information about how to participate and a closing date. The ASA understood that only consumers aged 18 years and over could participate in the promotion; promotional vouchers had to be claimed by 31 October 2023; only one claim could be made per product purchased; and that consumers could only make two claims per day each. We considered those were significant conditions which were likely to affect consumers’ understanding of the promotion and their decision to participate. We therefore considered their omission was likely to mislead. The CAP Code also stated that marketing communications that included a promotion and which were significantly limited by space must include as much information about significant conditions as practicable. The ad did not include any of the above significant conditions of the promotion. However, we considered the ad was not sufficiently limited by time or space to justify their omission. We therefore concluded the ad had breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.1 (Promotional marketing), 8.17, 8.17.1, 8.17.4, 8.17.4.a, 8.17.7, and 8.18 (Significant conditions for promotions).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on May Health Tourism Services t/a MAYCLINIK,"In June 2023 the United Nations confirmed that, following a request from their government, that the Republic of Turkey would henceforth be identified as the Republic of Türkiye. Although the change has been implemented, we have used the former here because it is currently more commonly understood by consumers. This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on cosmetic surgery abroad. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Google search ad for MAYCLINIK, seen on 6 September 2023, stated “All Inclusive Packages – Tummy Tuck Prices in Turkey”. Further text below stated “Get Rid of Your Excess Abdominal Fat [...] Safe Surgery. Airport Transfer, 5 Stars Accommodation, Book Your Free Consultation, Free…”.","The ASA challenged whether: 1. the claim “Safe Surgery” was misleading and irresponsible; and 2. the references to “All Inclusive Packages” and “5 Stars Accommodation” were irresponsible, because they trivialised the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery.","1. & 2. May Health Tourism Services t/a MAYCLINIK said they were a health tourism company that had operated for over five years. They were a member of the Association of Turkish Travel Agencies, which was a regulatory body of the Turkish government relating to health tourism. They collaborated with hospitals that were strictly regulated by the Turkish Ministry of Health, akin to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in the UK. They understood the concerns surrounding ads for cosmetic surgery abroad and took them seriously to achieve the highest standards of care. They considered that it was noteworthy that they maintained their status as an accredited and regulated entity, having published a multitude of ads. Their accredited status was a commitment undertaken to safeguard the well-being of patients. Furthermore, their ads adhered to Google's guidelines. Regarding the term ""Safe Surgery"", they said that it directly related to their commitment to patient safety and well-being. They collaborated exclusively with regulated, qualified and fully equipped hospitals, as well as experienced anaesthesiologists. All surgical procedures were conducted within hospital settings, adhering to rigorous safety protocols specified in patient consents. Patient safety remained their paramount concern, and they took all necessary precautions to provide a secure surgical environment. The references to ""All Inclusive Packages"" and ""5 Stars Accommodation"" were used to reassure their patients and their companions by addressing any potential concerns regarding the quality of their accommodations, transportation and overall experience. They considered that by offering all-inclusive packages with five-star accommodation options, they provided a seamless medical tourism experience that allowed patients to focus solely on their medical services. They said they were fully committed to adhering to Google Ads policies and the guidelines established by Google. Their commitment included ensuring the accuracy and compliance of their ads, without any use of behaviour or language that contravened these guidelines. Google UK said that Google Ireland had confirmed the ad was served through Google Ads, a self-administered system. Under the terms agreed to by advertisers, it was the advertiser’s responsibility to abide by applicable laws and regulations, including the CAP Code. The ad in question was found to be in breach of Google’s policies and had been disapproved.","1. Upheld The ad featured the claim “Safe Surgery”. The ASA considered that consumers would understand this claim to mean that undergoing abdominoplasty at MAYCLINIK could not result in any detriment to the patient. We acknowledged that the credentials and certifications the advertiser had referenced related to the quality of care and conditions at the hospitals and laboratories with which they worked. However, we understood that all cosmetic surgery procedures, including abdominoplasty, carried some level of risk to the patient, including when carried out at appropriately certified institutions. We therefore concluded that the claim “Safe Surgery” was misleading and that it was also irresponsible. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 3.1 (Misleading Advertising). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required marketing communications to be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The ad included references to ""All Inclusive Packages"",""5 Stars Accommodation"" and “Airport Transfer”, items of the cosmetic surgery package which people would closely associate with holidays. We considered that the ad was not likely to be interpreted as promoting a holiday; rather, its purpose was clear that it was for cosmetic surgery abroad. However, because the overall tone of the ad focused on the travel, together with the use of the colloquial term “Tummy Tuck” to describe abdominoplasty, it was likely to detract from the seriousness of the surgery offered. It was also relevant that the surgery would take place abroad which raised the potential for additional risks, such as: whether the doctors and treatment providers would have the same standards of care and safety as in the UK; and how any arrangements for follow-up care and dealing with any complications which arose would be managed. We considered that the ad could be interpreted as suggesting that surgery was a decision that could be undertaken lightly as part of a holiday, without serious consideration of the nature of the intervention. We therefore concluded that the overall presentation of the ad was likely to be seen as trivialising cosmetic surgery. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).",The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told May Health Tourism Services t/a MAYCLINIK not to claim that a cosmetic intervention was safe or to trivialise the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/may-health-tourism-services-a23-1211989-may-health-tourism-services.html
ASA Ruling on Medi Supplies Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A website for Medi Supplies, www.medisupplies.co.uk, an online retailer of medical products, featured two product pages seen in August 2023: a. The ad for “Koolpak Kool Patch” included text which stated “Special offer – buy today for the lowest price on the market.” Red text underneath the product’s name at the top of the listing stated “As Low £2.76”. b. The ad for “SoChlor DST Disinfectant Tablets” featured red text underneath the product’s name at the top of the listing which stated “As Low As £2.64”.","The complainant challenged whether the price claims in: 1. ad (a), that the product was available at “the lowest price on the market”, was misleading and could be substantiated; and 2. ad (b) was misleading and could be substantiated","1. Medi Supplies Ltd said that the product seen in ad (a), the Koolpak Kool Patch, had been reduced several years earlier as part of a clearance offer, and the claim “lowest price on the market” had been added following online checks made at the time. They explained that the claim had not been removed due to an oversight when the price of the product increased in 2022. They believed the impact of that error was minimal, due to low sales for the product, and confirmed that the product page had been updated once they were made aware of the issue. 2. Regarding ad (b), which listed SoChlor DST Disinfectant Tablets as being available from “As Low As £2.64”, Medi Supplies said that their website presented an “As Low As” price mainly for ease of comparison when viewing a product and its associated accessories, if any were available for purchase alongside the main product. They said that for most products, particularly any sold in volume, their approach was straightforward because the website defaulted to the lowest price it could find in a price grid seen on a product’s page [which included accessories]. They believed that was usually a fair reflection of the lowest price a consumer could pay for an item, which was why they used “As Low As”, rather than “From” to describe the pricing.Medi Supplies said that this system caused issues with a small minority of products when an expensive item included much cheaper accessories within the page’s price grid. They said that in such circumstances they manually excluded certain product lines from their “As Low As” prices or amended pages they found that encountered such issues. They explained that a diluter bottle intended for use with the tablets seen in ad (b) had been available for the advertised “As Low As” price, rather than the tablets themselves. Medisupplies said that even if an “As Low As” price reflected a lower priced accessory seen on a product page, rather than the more expensive main product, consumers would be able to see the actual price of the main product prior to adding it to their basket or purchasing it. They reiterated their belief that the impact of the error would have been minimal, due to low sales figures, and that they had amended the page to reflect the lowest price of the tablets, and not the diluter bottle, once made aware of the issue. They also said that if a consumer had contacted them quoting the prices seen in either ad, they would have honoured the advertised prices.","1. Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim that they could purchase the product featured in ad (a) “for the lowest price on the market” to mean that it could not be purchased from any other retailer across the UK for less than £2.76, and that the claim was accurate at the time they viewed the ad. We considered that to substantiate the claim that the product had been available at “the lowest price on the market” Medi Supplies would have needed to provide comparative sales data covering all retailers of the product across the UK. We were not provided with such substantiation, however, and we noted that the complainant reported seeing the product featured in ad (a) available at a lower price from another online retailer. Because Medi Supplies did not provide any evidence to suggest that the product had been available to purchase from them at the lowest price on the market, we concluded that the claim had not been substantiated and was therefore misleading. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (Prices). 2. Upheld Ad (b) was a product page for SoChlor DST Disinfectant Tablets. Because the claim “As Low As £2.64” appeared underneath the product’s name, and the product description discussed the uses and specifications of the disinfectant tablets, we considered consumers would expect the “As Low As” price to refer to the lowest price at which they could purchase SoChlor DST Disinfectant Tablets from the Medi Supplies website. We noted that the product page also included related accessories for use with the disinfectant tablets, namely a diffuser bottle and three different sizes of diluter bottles. All the products listed on the page included price ranges which showed decreasing individual unit costs if they were bought in different multiples - for example, the disinfectant tablets were listed as costing £15.60 if between one to five packs were purchased, and £13.80 if 10 or more packs were purchased. We noted that £13.80 was the cheapest available price to purchase the tablets and that none of the prices referred to the £2.64 price seen at the top of the ad. We noted that further down the page, under the price options for the one litre diluter bottle, the lowest listed price, applicable if consumers purchased 10+ bottles, was £2.64. We understood that the website would, by default, display the lowest attainable price listed for a product on its product page, and that problems could sometimes arise when a product page included accessories which were available at a lower price than the main product. That appeared to be the case for the product listed in ad (b), and therefore meant that the stated price did not apply to the product itself.Because the SoChlor DST Disinfectant Tablets were not available at the stated price, we concluded that the price claim had not been substantiated and was misleading. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (Prices).",The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Medi Supplies Ltd to ensure that future pricing claims seen on their website were accurate and could be substantiated.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/medi-supplies-ltd-18969.html
ASA Ruling on Outsourceful Ltd t/a Outsourceful,,"An email and website www.outsourceful.co.uk for Outsourceful, a recruitment agency, was seen on 11 August 2023: a. The email, which was from Property Industry Eye, a residential property industry news outlet, for Outsourceful stated “if your employees can work remotely, why pay £20ph in the UK when you could pay £5ph using us! we make it cost £5 per hour for one who speaks English perfectly… hire someone who won’t call in sick on Monday morning… one who will give 110% effort. Outsourceful hiring: 1. let us know the job role 2. we find the perfect remote fulltime employee 3. they cost you £950 per month for a 40 hour week We provide outsourced employees for your estate or lettings agency. We hire predominantly in the Philippines as they speak with an American-like accent, they are extremely hard working and very service oriented. They’ll work your UK hours, and will be more dedicated to your team than your UK workers. If you’ve got an admin role going, or you need a client accountant, or someone to just chase those bloody CP12s, or need simply a social media manager. These roles usually cost £950-1150 a month all in, that includes salary, taxes, literally everything. […] One agency has now saved £66k per year on salaries.” At the bottom of the email were photos of three Filipino women and their employment profiles beneath the heading “Meet some of our recent employees”. b. The website www.outsourceful.co.uk included a page which stated “Lettings & Estate Agent employees from £950 p/m”. The page included a ""Cost Comparison"" between the UK and the Philippines. Underneath ""United Kingdom"" text stated ""£20.10 p/h"" and listed alongside question marks ""18.05% Employer Taxes"", ""28 Days Holiday"", ""Strict Employment Laws"", ""High Staff Turnover"" and ""Low Productivity"". Underneath ""Philippines"" text stated ""£5 p/h"" and listed alongside tick marks ""10% employer taxes"", ""10 days holiday"", ""Very Hardworking"", ""Service Orientated"", ""Native English Speakers"". Text underneath the comparison stated “Hire 2 Employees for the price of 1 UK person”. The page included the same employment profiles from three Filipino women as ad (a). Under the section headed “They can…” text included “100% fluent in English with American-like dialects” and “Hard-working and diligent and no need to micromanage”. At the bottom of the page was a “FAQ” section. In response to the question “Proficient in English?”, text stated “Yes, we only recruit employees fully proficient in spoken and written English. In the Philippines, people have an American-like accent, and are extremely service oriented and your customers will not think they’re being scammed”.","The complainant, who believed the ads perpetuated negative racial stereotypes, challenged whether they were harmful and likely to cause serious offence.","In relation to ad (a), Outsourceful Ltd said the claim that they “make it cost £5 per hour for one who speaks English perfectly…” was factually correct; all their employees spoke English perfectly. In relation to the claim that potential employers could “hire someone who won’t call in sick on Monday morning”, if one of their remote employees called in sick, they provided a replacement person immediately, who was equally qualified. With regard to the “Cost Comparison” between the UK and the Philippines in ad (b), they said they had data to support the claims made about high staff turnover and low productivity in the UK from credible external sources. It was true that the UK had stricter employment laws than the Philippines. Their employees were very hard working, service orientated and spoke English natively. Notwithstanding their defence of the ads, they said they had made extensive changes to their website to address the concerns raised, and that they would not use the email ad (a), or similar emails again. Property Industry Eye Ltd said that they were paid by Outsourceful to send the email (ad (a)) to their database of subscribers. Outsourceful provided the content for the email which was clearly prefaced by the words “An offer from a client”. Property Industry Eye had no editorial control over the content of the email. They checked the email content prior to sending for unsuitable or inappropriate content and found there to be none. They did not receive any complaints from their subscribers.","Upheld The CAP code required marketers to ensure that ads were prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, and did not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence, with particular care to be taken to avoid causing offence on grounds of various protected characteristics, including race. CAP Advertising Guidance on avoiding racial and ethnic stereotypes likely to cause harm or serious or widespread offence, stated that even racial or ethnic stereotypes that may be seen as complimentary (for example, being intelligent, hard-working, strong or athletic), also had the potential to contribute to the generalisation of vastly diverse groups, and reinforce or promote limiting beliefs about that particular group or others, and therefore to cause harm. We understood that there was a stereotype that Asian people were hard workers and self-sufficient. We also understood that Filipino people frequently migrated for work abroad. In the UK in 2022, people from the Philippines were the second largest group of foreign domestic workers by country issued with worker visas. Although the ads related to remote workers based in the Philippines, and not those who had migrated from the Philippines to the UK to work, we nonetheless considered there was a risk that ads that reinforced or promoted stereotypes regarding Filipino people’s work ethic, including a propensity not to take sickness absence, could be harmful to both groups and leave them open to exploitation. The ads were for a recruitment company that sourced remote workers who were living in the Philippines and promoted them on the basis that they were significantly cheaper than UK workers, spoke English fluently, would not call in sick, were extremely hard working and service oriented, would work UK hours and be more dedicated than UK workers. Ad (b) also included a comparison with the UK, including that Filipino workers had fewer days of annual leave. We sought a view on the ads from the Kanlungan Filipino Consortium, a charity representing Filipino and other migrant communities in the UK. Their view was that the ads used language which supported racial and ethnic stereotypes about Filipino workers. They considered that such stereotypes might influence UK companies to recruit Filipino and other East and Southeast Asian migrants on low wages, which could increase cases of labour exploitation and trafficking amongst Filipino workers, both in the Philippines and abroad. We considered that the claims in ad (a) “hire someone who won’t call in sick on a Monday morning” and “one who will give 110% effort” played on existing stereotypes of Asian people being hard workers, which could reinforce harmful stereotypes, and leave them open to exploitation by employers. We further considered that the description in ad (a) of people from the Philippines as “Very Hardworking” and “Service Oriented”, and the claim in ad (b) that “In the Philippines, people have an American-like accent, and are extremely service oriented” generalised about people from the Philippines, a diverse population, in a way which was likely to perpetuate harmful stereotypes. We further considered that the text underneath the comparison which stated “Hire 2 Employees for the price of 1 UK person” promoted a harmful stereotype of workers from the Philippines offering cheap, commoditised labour. On that basis we concluded that the ads had not been prepared in a socially responsible way because they promoted harmful racial stereotypes and that they were also likely to cause serious offence to some people. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social Responsibility) and 4.1 (Harm and offence).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Outsourceful Ltd to ensure that they avoided causing harm or serious offence, particularly on the grounds of race.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/outsourceful-ltd-a23-1208780-outsourceful-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Pasifik Health Services Inc t/a Care In Turkey,"In June 2023 the United Nations confirmed that, following a request from their government, that the Republic of Turkey would henceforth be identified as the Republic of Türkiye. Although the change has been implemented, we have used the former here because it is currently more commonly understood by consumers. This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on cosmetic surgery abroad. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Google search ad for Care in Turkey, seen on 6 September 2023, stated “Ultimate Rhinoplasty Solution – Get Your Dream Nose in Turkey”. Further text below stated “Enhance your facial appearance with safe and natural-looking rhinoplasty in Turke [sic]. Get the best rhinoplasty experience in Turkey with safe and affordable services. World-Class Doctors”.",The ASA challenged whether the claims: 1. “World-Class Doctors” was misleading and could be substantiated; and 2. “safe […] rhinoplasty” and “safe […] services” were misleading and irresponsible.,"1. & 2. Pasifik Health Services Inc t/a Care in Turkey said that they were a health services organisation that provided services in the fields of aesthetic treatments, surgeries and general health. They had gathered 1,500 “solution partners” with expertise such as health, travel, accommodation and transportation to their international patients. They considered that Istanbul was home to some of the most advanced medical facilities in Europe. Because of this, it received international recognition and patients from all over the world. Care in Turkey and their partners strove to reach high standards in innovation, professionalism, research and development. They worked with eminent professionals to ensure that patients had a great medical experience at affordable prices. They named some of the professionals and hospitals they worked with and attached some of their professional accreditations. They said they worked with hospitals, laboratories and health centres that had various accreditations on quality achievement, patient care and safety. They had not faced any issue, lawsuit, complaint or dispute with customers regarding the ad in question. The ads were served via Google Ads. Care in Turkey understood Google Ads checked whether their ads complied with Google’s advertising policies. They provided an excerpt from a Google Advertising Policies ‘Help’ page which stated that they used a combination of Google AI and human evaluation to ensure that ads complied, and that they took action against ads and accounts that violated them. On that basis, Care in Turkey believed Google Ads would have imposed sanctions on them if their ads included misleading statements. Google UK said that following the investigation, Google Ireland confirmed that the ad was served through Google Ads, a self-administered system. Under the terms agreed by the advertisers, it was the advertiser’s responsibility to abide by the applicable laws and regulations, which included the CAP Code. The ad in question was found to be in breach of Google’s policies and was disapproved.","1. Upheld The CAP Guidance on the Marketing of Surgical and Non-Surgical Cosmetic Procedures stated that marketers should be able to prove claims such as “leading surgeons”, “best surgeons”, “foremost surgeons” and “surgeons of the highest calibre”. They would need to show that the surgeons’ achievements and experience put them near the top of the profession in their surgical speciality nationally or internationally, depending on the context. Showing that the surgeons had held high administrative posts in the medical profession was unlikely, on its own, to be enough. The ASA considered consumers would understand the claim “World-Class Doctors”, in the same way as the above claims referenced in the CAP Guidance, to mean that the plastic surgeons who performed rhinoplasties through Care in Turkey were near the top of their profession. Because of the wider connotations of the term “World-Class”, we considered that the context for the claim was international, and therefore that the doctors were amongst the best in the world. Care in Turkey provided us with professional certifications relating to four of their doctors, of whom only two were Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic surgeons. The certificates included: one membership to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (2023), one membership to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, two Fellowships from the European Board of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery (2004, 2012), and a certificate of professorship for the Bezmiâlem Foundation University. We did not receive any evidence that contextualised those certifications within the overall standards of plastic surgery practitioners globally. Because of this, we were not satisfied that Care in Turkey had demonstrated that its doctors’ achievements and experience put them near the top of their profession worldwide. In addition, they had only provided evidence in relation to four doctors and had not confirmed that these were the only surgeons who provided services to their patients. We understood that they worked with a number of different hospitals and it was therefore likely that other surgeons also operated on their customers. We concluded that the claim “World-Class Doctors” had not been substantiated and was therefore misleading. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading Advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). 2. Upheld The ad featured the claims “safe […] rhinoplasty” and “safe […] services”. We considered that consumers would understand those claims to mean that undergoing a rhinoplasty or any other service at Care in Turkey did not carry any risks and could not result in any detriment to the patient. We acknowledged that the credentials and certifications the advertiser had referenced related to the quality of care and conditions at the hospitals and laboratories with which they worked. However, we understood that all cosmetic surgery procedures, including rhinoplasty, carried some level of risk to the patient, including when carried out at appropriately certified institutions. We therefore concluded that the claims “safe […] rhinoplasty”, and “safe […] services” were misleading and were also irresponsible. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social Responsibility) and 3.1 (Misleading Advertising).","The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Pasifik Health Services Inc t/a Care in Turkey not to mislead consumers by making claims such as “World-class” in the absence of adequate substantiation. We further told them not to claim that a cosmetic intervention, including rhinoplasty, was safe.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/pasifik-health-services-inc-a23-1211995-pasifik-health-services-inc.html
ASA Ruling on E-Scooters 4 Less (unconfirmed) t/a E-Scooters 4 Less,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A website for E-Scooters 4 Less, www.escooters4less.co.uk, seen in August 2023, featured a webpage titled “ARE E-SCOOTERS LEGAL?”. Text stated “If you’re looking to buy an E-scooter, it’s important to understand where you can and can’t ride it. The sight of more people riding e-scooters on roads may make you think they’re okay to ride. However, there are different rules for different areas of the country. It’s important to do your research before riding”. This was followed by further text that stated “E-scooters are legal to ride on private land and are being trialed [sic] in some areas of the UK, including London. With more people avoiding public transport […] it’s believed the police are taking a lenient view on e-scooter use unless they’re being used recklessly. At E-Scooters 4 Less, we believe it’s only a matter of time until electric scooters can be ridden freely in the UK”. Text at the end of the ad stated “When riding an electric scooter, it’s important to ensure your rear braking lights are visible and you obey the rules of the road”. A second webpage contained images and description of an E-scooter available for purchase. At the end of the page a section titled “ARE E-SCOOTERS ILLEGAL?” featured text that stated “E-scooters are being trialled on the pavement in several areas of the UK. For now, they’re banned but our customers tell us regularly that these rules aren’t enforced if you are both safe and considered when riding your e-scooter. We believe the UK government will soon make electric scooters legal again”.","The Driver Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), who stated it was illegal to ride privately owned electric scooters on UK roads and in public places, challenged whether the ad was: 1. misleading; and 2. irresponsible.",E-Scooters 4 Less did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by the lack of response from E-Scooters 4 Less and the apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. 1. Upheld The ASA considered the Department for Transport’s guidance on powered transporters (an umbrella term that included electric scooters, last updated in July 2020), which stated that electric scooters (e-scooters) could only be used on private land, to which the general public did not have access, with the permission of the landowner or occupier. Although there were currently some very limited exceptions of use in public areas that related to rental (as opposed to privately owned) e-scooters only, we understood that the use of e-scooters outside of those circumstances was illegal. We also understood at the time the ad was seen there were no proposed changes to the legal status or permitted use of privately owned e-scooters. We considered that, despite the increasing prevalence of e-scooters, consumers would not necessarily be aware of the legality of using them. We understood that the e-scooters featured on the advertiser’s own website were for purchase for private ownership. We considered that the text “E-scooters are legal to ride on private land and are being trialed [sic] in some areas of the UK, including London” gave the impression that consumers would be able to ride privately owned e-scooters, which were not part of those trials, legally on public roads in some areas of the UK. We further considered consumers would understand the text “When riding an electric scooter, it’s important to ensure your rear braking lights are visible and you obey the rules of the road” within the context of the Highway Code. We considered consumers would be aware of the legal requirements for motorised vehicles using a public road to have a working break light, and because of that, would interpret the text “the rules of the road” as a reference to mandatory rules for road users and that those applied to e-scooters. We therefore considered consumers would understand that they would be able to use a privately purchased e-scooter on a public road if those mandatory requirements were fulfilled. We also considered that the use of “we believe it is only a matter of time until electric scooters can be ridden freely in the UK” would be interpreted to mean that it would soon be possible to ride privately owned e-scooters legally in the UK on public roads. Because it suggested that a change in law was imminent, we considered that this text further strengthened the impression that consumers were able to ride privately owned e-scooters on public roads. Because the overall impression of the ad was that it was legal to use privately owned e-scooters on public roads and pavements, we concluded the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 3.9 (Qualification). 2. Upheld As above, we understood that the use of privately owned e-scooters, other than in limited circumstances, was illegal. In areas where rental scooter trials were taking place, it was prohibited to ride those e-scooters on pavements. We considered that the manner in which the ad described privately owned e-scooters suggested that they could be used on public roads in the UK and that consumers would understand it was legal to use them in those ways. Furthermore, we considered consumers would understand the text “Are E-scooters illegal?” along with the text “E-scooters are being trialed [sic] on the pavement in several areas in the UK ” to mean that it was legal to ride privately owned e-scooters on the pavement in trial areas. We also considered that the text “… it’s believed the police are taking a lenient view on e-scooter use unless they’re being used recklessly” and “For now, they’re banned but our consumers tell us regularly that these rules aren’t enforced if you are both safe and considered when riding your e-scooter” gave the impression that the law would not be enforced in cases where riders were cautious and sensible. Because the ad implied that both privately owned and trial e-scooters could be used in ways that were contrary to current legislation and suggested that enforcement on the law was lenient in that manner, and that the legislation could therefore be ignored, we concluded that the ad was socially irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told E-Scooters 4 Less to ensure future ads did not mislead and were not socially irresponsible by suggesting that e-scooters could be used in public places in the UK. We also told them to ensure their ads made clear that the use of e-scooters was currently permitted only on private land, and there were no forthcoming changes to the law or leniency in enforcing it. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/e-scooters-4-less--unconfirmed--a23-1207531-e-scooters-4-less--unconfirmed-.html
ASA Ruling on FunPlus International AG t/a Funplus,,"An ad for the mobile app game Stormshot: Isle of Adventure, seen in the mobile app game Hill Climb Racing 2 on 7 October 2023, featured a dark room with a man approaching whilst carrying a torch. He shone the torch in a young woman’s face. She was lying in bed, her hands were gripping the top of her covers and she had a frightened look on her face. The scene then cut to him lifting up her skirt, revealing her bare legs. A voice-over and on-screen text stated “The drunk soldier slowly approached the girl, lifted up her skirt and then started to play Stormshot”. The ad then cut to scenes of animated gameplay from Stormshot.","The complainant, who believed that the ad trivialised and condoned sexual assault against women, challenged whether it was irresponsible, offensive and harmful.","FunPlus International AG t/a FunPlus Interactive said the ad had been published during the period 21 September to 14 October 2023 via Facebook Ads in third-party apps selected by the Facebook algorithm. Publication was limited to the age-restricted category 18+ only. The ad was not published in any other media or platform. As soon as they became aware of the ad they ensured it was immediately withdrawn on 14 October 2023. They said they would not publish the ad, or similar content, in future. They had provided additional training to staff and external agencies on their internal policies, which incorporated complying with the CAP Code, including rules regarding social responsibility and harm and offence. Fingersoft, publishers of the Hill Climb Racing 2 app in which the ad was seen, explained that it had inadvertently got through their pre-inspection measures. They also had measures in place to take action when a player reported an ad using their in-game support form, but that relied on the form being submitted soon after the ad had appeared and before the campaign had been turned off by another publisher or the ad network. They said they would block FunPlus Interactive's ads from appearing in their games in future if there was any indication that those ads featured similar content.","Upheld The CAP Code required that ads must not cause serious or widespread offence and must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. It also required that ads must contain nothing that is likely to condone or encourage violence or anti-social behaviour and must not include gender stereotypes in a way that is likely to cause harm. The ad had been published in the Hill Climb Racing 2 game app, which had a rating of being suitable for everyone and therefore was likely to be seen by children as well as adults. The opening scene of the ad featured a man emerging from the darkness and approaching a woman in bed. She was gripping the covers and looked distressed as he shone a torch at her. The scene then cut to him lifting up her skirt, revealing her bare legs. The voice-over and on-screen text stated “The drunk soldier slowly approached the girl, lifted up her skirt and then started to play Stormshot”. The ASA considered that the mood of the ad was dark and threatening. Although the final part of the voice-over and on-screen text stated that the man then played Stormshot, we considered consumers would interpret the ad as suggesting the man was going to sexually assault the woman without her consent and the only thing to distract him and stop him from doing so was by playing Stormshot, a video game. We considered that by implying an act of sexual violence was going to take place and that it was only interrupted because of the man’s greater desire to play the game, the ad trivialised and condoned sexual assault and sexual violence. By presenting the woman as an object of sexual gratification in that way the ad also included a gender stereotype, which was likely to cause harm.

ASA Ruling on Marble Corporation Ltd t/a The Little Ones,,"A product page for the “Baby Elephant Hug Pillow” on The Little Ones website www.thelittleones.co.uk, a retailer of children and baby products, was seen on 25 October 2023. The ad featured images of the pillow, including one which featured a sleeping infant, lying on their side between the elephant’s legs and cuddling it.","The ASA, who understood the infant was shown in an unsafe sleep position associated with Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy (SUDI), challenged whether the image was irresponsible because it condoned or encouraged an unsafe practice.","Marble Corporation Ltd t/a The Little Ones said the image in the ad was provided to them, along with the other product images, from the supplier. They acknowledged that the baby was shown to be sleeping and resting on the toy, but did not believe that the image suggested babies should sleep in a cot with the product or be left unsupervised whilst sleeping with it. They said that the image did not feature a cot, and because of that, they believed the ad did not encourage parents to put their babies to bed with the pillow. The Little Ones also said that the ad stated not to leave babies unsupervised with the product and provided an image of the product label which re-iterated that recommendation. However, they believed there were scenarios that were safe for babies and infants under adult supervision, which could be unsafe if they were left unattended. Furthermore, they said the product was not solely intended to cuddle and that it could also be used as a toy.","Upheld The ASA understood that babies whose heads were covered were at an increased risk of SUDI. We noted that NHS Guidance on sudden infant death stated babies should be placed on their back and should not be put to sleep on their side. It also stated that pillows should not be used by babies because they would be unable to push any bedding away, and consequently, were at risk of suffocation if their face became smothered by such items. The ad described the product as a “hug pillow” and featured an image of a sleeping baby lying on their side and cuddling the pillow. We considered that consumers would interpret the image of the sleeping baby to mean that they had been put to bed with the pillow and had been placed on their side to sleep. We also considered that the text “hug pillow” reinforced the impression that it was intended for infants and babies to cuddle it, as they slept. We acknowledged that the ad stated parents should not leave their babies or children unsupervised with the product and did not feature a cot. However, we considered that did not override the overall impression of the ad. Because the ad showed a baby sleeping on its side and using a pillow, which were both unsafe sleep practices associated with SUDI, we concluded that the ad was irresponsible and encouraged an unsafe practice. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising), 4.5 (Harm and offence), 5.1 and 5.1.2 (Children).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Marble Corporation Ltd t/a The Little Ones to ensure their future ads were socially responsible and did not encourage or condone unsafe practices.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/marble-corporation-ltd-a23-1217662-marble-corporation-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on GIRLvsCANCER,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An outdoor poster for the “Smash the Stigma” campaign from the charity GIRLvsCANCER, seen in October 2023. The ad featured a close-up image of a woman’s torso, as she held one of her breasts in her hand, with her arm obscuring her other breast. The top of her other hand was placed between her legs. Large white text the length of the image stated “CANCER WON’T BE THE LAST THING THAT F*CKS ME”. Text at the bottom of the poster stated the charity’s name. Further text at the bottom right of the image, next to a QR code, stated “SMASH THE STIGMA”.",Two complainants challenged whether the ad was: 1. likely to cause serious or widespread offence; and 2. inappropriate for display in an untargeted medium.,"1 & 2. GIRLvsCANCER said that the ad had intended to represent the real-life experience of women regarding sex and cancer, and the emotions they had experienced. They accepted that this might have made some people feel uncomfortable, but did not believe the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. GIRLvsCANCER said that the imagery in the ad had been carefully crafted so that both of the model’s breasts had been covered, and no other body parts beyond her main torso were visible. GIRLvsCANCER said they took matters of social responsibility seriously. They believed raising awareness of the issues the ad addressed showed a wider sense of societal responsibility, by representing the views and experiences of an under-represented section of society. They did not think the language or images used in the ad had been gratuitous, but rather were relevant to the lived experiences and issues faced by many women with cancer. They felt the use of the word “fuck” was in-keeping with and necessary for the campaign message and creative execution, and re-iterated that the ad had been based on close collaboration with the women whose stories they were conveying. They wanted the ad to spark conversations about how women felt during and after diagnosis and treatment for cancer, because they believed encouraging people to talk was the most effective way to enact change. They said the model, and all other models in the wider campaign were cancer survivors or those currently with cancer, who they had worked with to portray their stories in a way which reflected their experiences. Build Hollywood, the media owner, said that the ad had been removed by the time they were made aware of the complaint. They thought that the ad touched on an important topic which was too often perceived to be a taboo subject, and deserved to be highlighted and talked about openly. They said they had not intended to offend viewers, but rather to educate them, as well as support the cancer community and reduce stigma surrounding the issue. They said that due to the subject matter depicted in the ad, the poster had not been distributed within 100 m of a school. They confirmed that had not received any direct complaints.","1. & 2.Upheld The CAP Code required marketers to avoid causing serious or widespread offence. The ASA acknowledged that the wording of the ad did not explicitly use the word “FUCKS”. However, we considered that the use of an asterisk to obscure the letter “U” in the ad meant that viewers were likely to understand the word as a reference to the expletive “fuck”. We noted the context in which the word appeared, and that the full text stated “CANCER WON’T BE THE LAST THING THAT F*CKS ME” which we considered viewers would understand to be an allusion to a colloquial term for sexual intercourse. We considered that the combination of the image of the woman holding her breast with her other hand placed between her legs, alongside the text, further contributed to that impression. Because of that, we also considered viewers were likely to interpret the images in the ad as depicting sexual behaviour in an explicit manner. We acknowledged GIRLvsCANCER’s comments that the ad was meant to represent the lived experience of women who had, or who had survived, cancer, and had been created to raise awareness of the subject. We also acknowledged their belief that the imagery and language used in the ad had been carefully chosen and was not gratuitous. However, we considered that “fuck” was a word so likely to offend that it should not generally be used or alluded to in advertising, even if viewers would understand that the ads were intended to raise awareness of women’s experience with cancer. We further considered that, within the context of the ad, the image was sufficiently sexually explicit to be likely to offend viewers. For those reasons we concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious and widespread offence, and was therefore also inappropriate for display in an untargeted medium where it could be seen by children. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility) and rule 4.1 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told GIRLvsCANCER to take care to avoid causing serious or widespread offence in future, and to ensure their ads were appropriately targeted.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/girlvscancer-g23-1218376-girlvscancer.html
ASA Ruling on Happytiger ApS,,"A TV ad for Happy Tiger Bingo, seen in October and November 2023, featured a testimonial by a man described in on-screen text as a “POSTGRADUATE STUDENT”. He stated “The most fun game on Happy Tiger for me has to be the bingo games. Just because of the bingo flash feature, like it's exciting, obviously, trying to get one line, two lines, three lines, but when the Bingo flash appears, and you see that £2,500 it’s like, yeah I wanna [sic] get that. So yeah, it's really fun because you're more involved with it, but it's not overly complicated or anything like that.”","The complainant challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it featured someone who seemed to be, or who was, under 25 years of age.","Happytiger ApS t/a Happytiger provided proof of date of birth for the featured individual and confirmed that he was 25 years old at the time of filming. They believed he did not have any features which made him appear younger than his actual age, and the on-screen text, which identified him as a “postgraduate student”, was unlikely to suggest to the audience that he was under 25 years old. Clearcast confirmed that they had verified the age of the individual prior to approving the ad. They acknowledged that the on-screen text “postgraduate student”, may have indicated to viewers that he was younger than 25 because he was still in education. However, because the ASA had received only one complaint, they believed that it was not a widespread interpretation and the majority of viewers understood that he was 25 years old.","Upheld The BCAP Code stated that gambling ads must not feature anyone who was, or seemed to be, under 25 years old gambling or playing a significant role. The ASA acknowledged that the individual featured in the ad was 25 years old at the time of filming. However, we considered that he had a youthful appearance. We noted that he appeared self-conscious and often used filler words, such as “obviously”, “like” and “so yeah”. We considered that viewers would associate his speaking style and body language with youth and immaturity, and along with his youthful appearance, that was likely to give the impression that he was under the age of 25. We noted the on-screen text “postgraduate student”. We understood that students in the UK typically began a bachelor’s degree between the ages of 17 and 19 and that qualification was usually completed in three or four years. While people of different ages undertook postgraduate studies, we considered viewers were likely to interpret his status as a post-graduate student to mean he was in his early twenties. We therefore considered that text reinforced the impression that he was under the age of 25. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad featured someone who seemed to be under the age of 25 and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP Code rule 17.4.6 (Gambling).","The ad must not be broadcast again in its current form. We told Happytiger Aps t/a Happytiger not to feature anyone in their ads who was, or seemed to be under 25 years old, for example, through their physical appearance, behaviour or occupational status.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/happytiger-aps-a23-1218378-happytiger-aps.html
ASA Ruling on Planet Computers Ltd,,"A website for Planet Computers, store.planetcom.co.uk, an online phone and computer retailer, seen on 23 August 2023, advertised the Astro Slide 5G smartphone for £819.00. Text stated “NEW – JUST LAUNCHED! PRE-ORDER NOW TO SECURE YOUR PLACE IN THE ORDER LIST!” and “… PRE-ORDER – STOCK EXP. AUG ‘23”.","The complainant, who maintained that there was no available stock and understood there was therefore no estimate for when the stock was expected, challenged whether the claim that stock would arrive in August 2023 was misleading and could be substantiated.","Planet Computers Ltd (Planet Computers) said they had published the dates that had been given to them, but they had had issues with the supplier and had experienced delays. They were willing to amend the date by which supplies were expected to January 2024 and were confident that they would receive supplies of the product by then.","Upheld The ASA considered consumers would understand from the ad that they could pre-order the Astro Slide 5G smartphone and that stocks were expected in August 2023, so customers would receive the device at that time. We acknowledged that Planet Computers said they had experienced delays with the supply of the product and we welcomed their proposal to change the expected date to one they were confident they could honour. However, we were aware of a blog entry Planet Computers had published online which referred to delays and other issues with manufacture and supply of the product dating from 2020 to the present day. Planet Computers had supplied no evidence that showed they could provide the product by the month they proposed - January 2024 - or any other date. We concluded, therefore, that the claim that stock of the Astro Slide 5G smartphone would arrive in August 2023 was misleading and had not been substantiated. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.29 (Availability).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Planet Computers Ltd not to advertise products that were not available and not to claim that stock of a product was expected by a particular date unless they held adequate substantiation for the claim.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/planet-computers-ltd-a23-1208206-planet-computers-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Viagogo AG,,"Two advertorials for viagogo, seen on www.nme.com: a. The first advertorial, seen on 16 June 2023, was headed “The best gigs to see this summer at Hyde Park”. Text below stated “A paid-for ad feature for viagogo”. The ad listed five gigs scheduled to take place at the festival “American Express Presents: BST Hyde Park: Blackpink, Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band, Pink, Guns N’ Roses and Lana Del Ray”. Text at the end of all five segments detailing each gig stated “Fans can buy and sell tickets for [name of artist performing] at global marketplace, viagogo, here”. The text included a link to the viagogo website, where tickets were sold for each gig. b. The second advertorial, seen on 20 July 2023, was headed “A beginners guide to getting Taylor Swift ‘Eras’ tour tickets. How to avoid the scammers and secure tickets”. Text below stated “A paid-for ad feature for viagogo”. The body copy included text which stated “to purchase resale tickets as safely as possible, fans should avoid buying tickets via social media […] Your best bet is ticket marketplaces like viagogo, which connects ticket sellers with fans via a safe platform. All viagogo orders come with a 100 percent customer guarantee that backs each order, which means fans get in the door or their money back – as ticket sellers don’t get paid until the buyer gets into the event successfully [...] For sellers as well, ticket marketplaces like viagogo offer a safe, secure way to sell unwanted tickets. Fans can buy and sell tickets for Taylor Swift at global marketplace, viagogo here”. The text included a link to the viagogo website, where tickets were sold for Taylor Swift’s tour.","FanFair Alliance, who understood the resale of tickets through secondary ticketing websites like viagogo was prohibited by the events listed in the ads, challenged whether the ads were misleading.","viagogo AG did not believe the ads were misleading. They said the ads simply stated that tickets for the events were legitimately available on their secondary ticketing marketplace and were not an offering to consumers to enter into a transaction for a specific ticket. There was no law which prohibited the resale of tickets for music events and they believed there was nothing in the ads which implied viagogo was an official primary ticketing outlet. They believed it was extremely unlikely that a customer would not gain admission to an event after purchasing a ticket through viagogo, even if the terms and conditions of the event itself purported that resale tickets were prohibited. Less than one per cent of customers were denied entry to events after having purchased a ticket on their platform, and they operated a guarantee so that if a customer was not admitted they would be entitled to a refund. They believed consumers would not consider that an ad for an event was misleading because it failed to mention every possible contingency that may arise - for example, that the event might be cancelled due to the illness of the performer. Furthermore, they explained that all additional information which related to a ticket for a specific event was clearly made available to consumers on the viagogo website before a consumer purchased that ticket. This included all relevant restrictions on resale that viagogo was aware of.viagogo explained that the Enforcement Order, obtained by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in 2018, only applied to their internal processes and the presentation of information on their website. They said they were in full compliance with the Order, which included the requirement to notify consumers of any relevant restrictions on resale that they were aware of. They believed there were no grounds for that Order to apply to any of viagogo’s advertising outside of their website.","Upheld The ASA acknowledged that the CMA Enforcement Order referenced by viagogo only applied to their internal processes and the presentation of information on their own website and did not apply outside of that. However, the CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead consumers by omitting material information. It also stated that ads must not mislead by hiding material information or presenting it in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner. We therefore assessed whether the ads omitted material information in relation to the resale policy of each event and whether the omission of that information was misleading. The ads included detailed descriptions about the BST Hyde Park festival (ad (a)) and the Taylor Swift Era’s tour (ad (b)), including information on when the events took place and how tickets could be bought and sold on viagogo’s website. For example, ad (a) stated “Fans can buy and sell tickets for [name of artist performing] at global marketplace, viagogo, here”. Ad (b) stated “to purchase resale tickets as safely as possible, fans should avoid buying tickets via social media […] Your best bet is ticket marketplaces like viagogo, which connects ticket sellers with fans via a safe platform” and “Fans can buy and sell tickets for Taylor Swift at global marketplace, viagogo here”. We considered consumers would understand those claims to mean that purchasing a ticket on viagogo was one way of obtaining a ticket for the events. We noted the ads did not include any information to make consumers aware that some venues, including the ones listed, did not accept resale tickets and that consumers who purchased them might be refused entry on the door. We understood that the official terms and conditions for the Taylor Swift Era’s tour stated ""your ticket(s) will immediately become invalid if resold or offered for sale unless the sale is through the official ticket agent fan to fan exchange. Tickets sold via third parties and other unauthorised outlets, including online auction sites, are not valid for admission. The resale of a ticket via unauthorized outlets renders it invalid and may lead to refusal of entry”. We also understood that the BST Hyde Park terms and conditions stated “tickets are not transferable unless purchased and transferred through Flash Mobile Delivery on the AXS platform” and “any tickets brought from unauthorised agents, or third parties are not valid and admission to the event will not be permitted”. Because viagogo was a secondary-ticket outlet, we considered BST Hyde Park and Taylor Swift Era’s tour tickets purchased on the viagogo website were purported to be invalid, according to both event’s terms and conditions. We understood that viagogo operated a guarantee whereby anyone who was not admitted to an event was entitled to receive a refund and we acknowledged that only a small proportion of their customers had been refused entry. However, we considered that the prohibition of resale tickets, as outlined in both the BST Hyde Park and Taylor Swift Era’s tour terms and conditions, was material information which was likely to affect a consumer’s decision to purchase tickets through viagogo. Because the ads omitted material information about the validity of tickets purchased through viagogo and the risk of the venues refusing entry to consumers who had purchased their tickets through secondary ticketing websites, we concluded that they were misleading. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told viagogo AG to ensure future ads did not mislead consumers by omitting material information regarding the entry restrictions on tickets purchased through them and other secondary ticketing sites.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/viagogo-ag-a23-1205905-viagogo-ag.html
ASA Ruling on Zzoomm plc,,"A direct mailing for Zzoomm, a broadband provider, received on 5 July 2023, featured a series of savings claims. Headline text at the top of the letter stated “Upgrade to 100% Full Fibre broadband and save over £240 a year”. Text in the body of the letter stated “When your neighbours are stuck paying for their over-priced, part fibre BT broadband […] you can sit back and enjoy a brand-new Full Fibre connection, and save a fortune! You could save £240.18 a year by switching to Zzoomm Full Fibre 150 for just £19.95 a month for 12 months compared to BT Fibre 1 at £29.99 a month for 24 months”. The letter included a pricing comparison table comparing Zzoomm’s Full Fibre 150 service to Sky’s Superfast 35 service, BT’s Fibre 1 service, and Plusnet’s Unlimited Fibre service. The table listed Zzoomm’s service as costing £19.95 a month over a 12-month term, for a total of £239.40, and BT’s service as costing £29.99 a month over a 24-month term, for a total of £719.76 as well as comparisons against other providers. Small print at the end of the letter stated “Offer terms. Save £10 a month on all Zzoomm 12-month home broadband plans […] Save £240.18 a year vs BT Fibre 1 calculated by comparing BT Fibre 1 Total Contract Value of £719.76 minus Zzoomm Full Fibre 150 Total Contract Value £239.40 and pro-rating to 12-month equivalent. Pricing comparison table […] correct as of 20/06/2023.”",The complainant challenged whether the claim “save over £240 a year” was misleading and could be substantiated.,"Zzoomm said that the price comparison table compared four broadband services available in the relevant postcode, which was within their full fibre broadband network. They said they offered the only full fibre broadband product available in that area and that all available pricing had been correct when the ad was seen. Zzoomm said the claim that consumers could save over £240 a year by changing to their Full Fibre 150 service had been calculated by estimating the cost of their service over 24 months, and comparing that against the cost of 24-month BT Fibre 1 contract. Upon re-checking the price comparison table, Zzoomm accepted that the calculations had been incorrect due to human error, for which they apologised.","Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “Upgrade to 100% Full Fibre broadband and save over £240 a year” to mean that they would be able to save £240 per year by switching to Zzoomm’s Full Fibre 150 service from a BT Fibre 1 service. The ad stated “You could save £240.18 a year by switching to Zzoomm Full Fibre 150 for just £19.95 a month for 12 months compared to BT Fibre 1 at £29.99 a month for 24 months”. We noted that the lengths of the contracts differed, and considered consumers would understand that they would save over £240 over the 12-month Zzoomm contract versus what they would have paid to BT over that period, and that they could save the same amount with a second 12-month contract to cover the full 24 months of the BT contract. However, we understood that Zzoomm had calculated the saving by deducting the total cost of a 12-month Zzoomm contract (£239.40) from the cost of what they had calculated for a 24-month BT contract (£719.76), leaving a saving of £480.46. However, that did not take into account the cost of the Zzoomm contract for the second year. The correct calculation should have been to subtract two 12-month Zzoomm contracts (£478.80) from the 24-month BT contract (£719.76), leaving a saving of £240.96. That was the amount identified in the advertiser’s response to the complaint. However, that was the total across 24 months, whereas the ad stated an amount that consumers could save per year. The saving per year according to the above calculation would be £120.48. In addition, we noted from the small print of the ad that the offer applied a £10 discount to 12-month home broadband plans, meaning that the regular cost of their Full Fibre 150 service would have been £29.95. We noted from the ad that the offer was due to end on 31 August 2023, and Zzoomm also reserved the right to withdraw it at any point. Because there was no guarantee that consumers would be able to pay the discounted rate of £19.95 in a hypothetical second year, we considered that further undermined the claimed saving. Because the ad claimed that consumers switching from BT’s Fibre 1 service could save over £240 a year if they signed up to Zzoomm’s Full Fibre 150 service when that was not the case, and because the ad implied that the monthly cost of £19.95 could be extrapolated over a 24-month period, when there was no evidence that consumers would be able to take advantage of that price once the 12-month offer period had ended, we concluded that the savings claims in the ad had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 3.33 and 3.35 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Zzoomm plc to ensure that their future marketing materials did not mislead consumers. Specifically, we told them to ensure future ads contained accurate savings figures which could be substantiated.

ASA Ruling on Buzz Group Ltd,,"A post on Buzz Bingo’s Facebook page, seen on 20 October 2023, comprised animated footage of a large full moon above a scene which featured grinning pumpkin heads, a lit church with towers whose roofs resembled pointed, witches’ hats, bats flying around, a spider in a web and a graveyard with a tombstone and a cross. Text in a font which resembled slime stated “MONSTER MONDAYS - £50,000 MUST BE WON EVERY MONDAY IN OCTOBER …” The logos for Buzz Bingo and “18+ - BeGambleAware.org” appeared at the bottom of the screen.",,"Buzz Group Ltd (Buzz Bingo) said the ad was featured on their social media page which was restricted to Facebook users aged 18 years and above. It was also used as part of a focused campaign specifically targeted at users aged 25 who had a confirmed interest in bingo. They believed the platform the ad featured on, Facebook, was one with evidence for the accuracy of their targeting. They therefore believed they had acted and had taken precautions to prevent children and young people being exposed to the ad. Nevertheless, they acknowledged the concern that the Halloween imagery could appeal to children. They had removed the ad on receipt of notification of the complaint and said they were making changes to their internal marketing approval procedures.","Upheld The Code stated that marketing communications for gambling products “must not be likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture”. The CAP guidance, “Gambling and lotteries advertising: protecting under-18s”, stated that animated content and graphics could contribute to the impression that material was designed to appeal to under-18s. It stated that ads should avoid using child-like background imagery, such as that common in nursery rhymes or children’s stories. We considered Halloween and the traditions surrounding it were likely to have strong appeal for children. Furthermore, the style of cartoon imagery used in the ad, which included trees with crooked and curly silhouettes; a smiling, carved pumpkin glowing warmly from within and text which resembled slime was reminiscent of children’s cartoons and story books. We also considered that the term “monster” was likely to appeal to children. For those reasons, we considered the ad was likely to be of strong appeal to children. We considered it would have been acceptable for the ad to have appeared in a medium where under-18s, for all intents and purposes, could be entirely excluded from the audience. That would apply in circumstances where those who saw the ad had been robustly age-verified as being 18 or older, such as through marketing lists which had been validated by payment data or credit checking. However, because Facebook was a media environment where users self-verified on customer sign-up and did not use robust age-verification, we considered Buzz Bingo had not excluded under-18s from the audience with the highest level of accuracy required for ads where their content was likely to appeal strongly to under-18s. We acknowledged the steps Buzz Bingo had taken in response to the complaint but, for the reasons stated above, we nevertheless concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code.The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1 and 16.3.12 (Gambling).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Buzz Group Ltd not to include themes or imagery that were likely to have strong appeal to those under 18 years of age in their ads in future.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/buzz-group-ltd-a23-1217474-buzz-group-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Em Rose,,"A poster, seen during September 2023, featured an image of model and influencer Em Rose wearing a bra and a silk top open at the front. The image, which was cropped at just below hip level, showed the top half of her thong-style underwear from the front. Her hand was placed on her chest. Text stated “onlyfans.com/emrosebydark” with the logo of the OnlyFans social media platform underneath. The poster also featured the Twitter, Instagram and TikTok logos and the text “@EMROSEBYDARK”.","The ASA received 12 complaints, including one from the London Borough of Haringey: 1. Some of the complainants, who believed the ad was overly sexualised and objectified women, challenged whether it was offensive or harmful. 2. All of the complainants, who understood that OnlyFans was an internet content subscription service which featured sexual adult content and were concerned that the ad was displayed in close proximity to a youth centre, milkshake shop, schools and a roller-skating rink, challenged whether the ad was inappropriate for display in an untargeted medium where children could see it.","1. & 2. Emily Rose said she had developed the ad with the sensibilities of potential audiences in mind. She believed it adhered to established advertising guidelines and reflected trends observed in leading brands. She considered that the image used was not suggestive or harmful, and believed it to be less provocative than mainstream ads for lingerie or perfume. Ms Rose said the ad deliberately omitted any call to action. She maintained that OnlyFans branding appeared in mainstream media, where it was associated with high-profile sporting personalities and viewed by audiences of all ages. She sent an example where the OnlyFans logo featured on a car at a motor racing championship and on a boxer’s clothing. The ad was placed with consideration to child safety and not in the vicinity of schools. Ms Rose believed the ad would not appeal to children because it did not feature bright colours, engaging slogans, fun elements or QR codes. She sent figures from her social media channel that showed her audience was primarily in the 25-44 age bracket. Ms Rose said the OnlyFans website had stringent restrictions in place. Mobile networks required users to contact their provider and submit identification as proof of age. The website also required credit card details and payment authorisation which served as safeguards before any content could be accessed. She understood that ads could be distasteful without causing serious or widespread offence under the Code, and the fact that that a product was offensive to some people was not grounds for the ASA to determine that the ad breached the Code. Amplify Outdoor, the media owner, said they had not received any complaints directly. They had not intended to cause offence but simply wished to provide a voice to a legitimate business that wanted to use their network. They reviewed the image to ensure it was suitable and provided Em Rose with a list of potential sites. Those sites excluded locations within 100 metres of schools. They believed the ad was suitable for public display because it did not mention sexual services or pornographic content. OnlyFans was a locked site that prevented under-18s from accessing explicit content. They believed the image was similar to those used in shampoo, gym wear and lingerie advertising. It was, in their view, relevant to the advertiser’s brand and business and did not employ sexual appeal in a manner that was exploitative of women .Amplify pointed out that the poster’s use of an image and social media icons was consistent with many other poster ad campaigns. They did not believe that all those who saw the poster would see the poster as sexual in nature; children in general did not know about OnlyFans and adults did not need to explain the content to them. Amplify drew a parallel with alcohol and gambling ads that were similarly displayed in outdoor media. They added that the OnlyFans logo appeared widely at boxing matches, golf tournaments and other sporting events, and pointed out that OnlyFans included content other than that of a sexual nature; for example, Em Rose had a workout page. They cited a previous ASA ruling where a similar poster was found not to be in breach of the Code.","1.& 2. Upheld The ad featured an image of Em Rose alongside the web address of her OnlyFans page and the icons of social media sites. The hashtag #EMROSEBYDARK referred to her profile name on those sites. The ad therefore promoted Ms Rose and her business on online platforms. The ASA understood that the OnlyFans platform contained various kinds of content posted by subscribers to its service, including adult sexual content. We acknowledged that some people would find ads for such services distasteful because of the nature of the service advertised, particularly if they appeared in an untargeted medium. However, the Code stated that the fact that a product was offensive to some people was not grounds for finding a marketing communication in breach of the Code. Legitimate businesses were permitted to advertise as long as they did so responsibly. Our assessment was, therefore, focussed on a consideration of the image, the text and the overall impression and the placement of the ad. The image showed Ms Rose in lingerie. She wore a push-up bra and her left hand was draped over her chest, which drew attention to her cleavage. The top and front of her thong-style underwear were clearly visible and the cropped image drew attention to the thin straps. An open blouse was worn off one shoulder, which suggested that she was in the process of undressing. Her hip was pushed forward, which placed further emphasis on her partially clothed body. Her head was at a slight angle, and her eyes were looking directly into the camera. We considered that her expression, in combination with the styling and her pose, was suggestive and coquettish. We considered that the styling, pose and expression would be seen as sexualised and provocative. Although we acknowledged it formed her social media handle, we considered that impression was further reinforced by the accompanying text “EMROSEBYDARK”. We acknowledged the image of Ms Rose was relevant to the OnlyFans service and in keeping with some of its usual content, which was sexual and explicit, but that the image was not exploitative or degrading in tone. Notwithstanding that, we considered that the combination of the image and the handle “@EMROSEBYDARK” in conjunction with an OnlyFans web address, meant that the ad taken as a whole would be seen as overtly sexual, particularly to those who were familiar with the content of the OnlyFans platform. The ad was shown on a poster in London close to a main road, which was an untargeted medium, and was therefore likely to be seen by large numbers of people, including under-18s. We acknowledged that Amplify had applied a targeting restriction in selecting a site that was not within 100 metres of any schools. We considered, however, that because the ad was overtly sexual and was displayed in an untargeted medium where it had the potential to be seen by a large number of people, including children, it was irresponsible and likely to cause widespread offence. We concluded that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising) and 4.1 (Harm and offence).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Em Rose to ensure that future advertising in outdoor media was not overtly sexual and to avoid causing widespread offence.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/em-rose-g23-1212743-em-rose.html
ASA Ruling on Erdem Clinic,"Four issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","Four TikTok videos for Erdem Clinic, on Millie Bracewell’s TikTok page, @milliebracewell5: a. The first video, posted on 9 August 2023, included shots of Millie Bracewell standing outside a hospital, followed by clips of her inside the hospital by herself, together with hospital staff, in the operating room, and again outside the hospital. The clips featured Millie Bracewell and the staff waving at the camera, while an excerpt from the Barbie movie was heard: “Hi Ken! Hi Barbie! Hi Barbie! Hi Barbie! Hi Barbie! Hi Barbie! Hi Barbie!” The Erdem Hospital logo appeared throughout the ad in the top right corner. The caption stated “Click the link in my bio to get 20% off any treatment/surgery using the code millieb [heart hands emoji] #foryou #fyp #erdemhospital #turkeysurgery”. b. The second video, posted on 9 August 2023, featured different clips of Millie having food at the hospital and walking around Istanbul. The voice-over stated, “So this is two days after surgery. […] It tends to be first thing in the morning when the pain reliever’s worn off from the previous night. […] The day of surgery and the day after I just wanted to sleep. The longer I was walking the more the pain started to hurt but I dealt with it. I think that was my body just saying yeah you need rest now […]””. The caption stated, “If anyone has anyone questions regarding breast surgery feel free to ask [heart hands emoji] #foryou #fyp #erdemhospital #turkeysurgery”. c. The third video, posted on 9 August 2023, featured Millie outside the hospital waving at the camera. She was then shown in a hospital gown and being taken towards the operating room. A surgeon measured and marked her chest and was then shown operating on her. In a further shot she waved at the camera and said “Thank you Erdem”. The logo “ERDEM ESTHETIC” appeared throughout the ad in the top right corner, and in the final shot. The caption stated, “I had an amazing experience at @Erdem Hospital definitely recommend to anyone wanting surgery! The quailty [sic] of care is phenomenal! Click the link in my bio to get 20% off any surgery/treatment using the code millieb [heart hands emoji] #foryou #fyp #erdemhospital #turkeysurgery”. The song “BLING BLING” was played in the background throughout the ad. d. The fourth video, posted on 15 August 2023, featured Millie Bracewell getting ready and going to the hospital. The voice-over stated, “This is day 6 post-op […] we went to the hospital, and I met with the surgeon who deals with obesity so I learnt quite a bit about that. Then I went to the main office and met with the team. […] Day 1 and day 2 are the worst, but it does get better I promise. […]”. The caption stated “#foryou #fyp #erdemhospital #turkeysurgery If anyone has any questions regarding breast augmentation feel free to ask me or the hopsital [sic]! I have a code you can use for 20% off any treatment or surgery if you use the code millieb [heart hands emoji] just click the link in my bio or dm them on Instagram [white heart emoji]”.","1. The complainant challenged whether ad (a) was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication. The ASA challenged whether: 2. ads (b), (c) and (d) were obviously identifiable as marketing communications; 3. ads (a) and (c) were irresponsible because they trivialised the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery; and 4. ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) were directed at those aged under 18 through the selection of media or context in which they appeared.","1., 2., 3., & 4. Erdem Clinic did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. Millie Bracewell said that the posts were not ads and that she was simply vlogging her journey. She had not received payment from Erdem Clinic, and her relationship to them was a normal customer relationship. Ms Bracewell stated that she would never promote that type of content to under 18s and that her audience was primarily adults. She provided her audience age analytics, which showed the ratios of different age-groups that followed her account. There was no available data on the followers below the age of 18. She further stated that going forward she would be more careful and clear when organically showcasing her personal experiences. TikTok confirmed that the posts under investigation were not marketed, sold or arranged by TikTok. They said that under their Terms of Service and Branded Content Policy, users were required to engage with their branded content disclosure tool, in order to identify the post as a marketing communication. However, the promotion of cosmetic surgery was prohibited under their Branded Content Policy, which was publicly communicated to users on the TikTok Business Help Centre. Therefore, if Millie Bracewell had engaged with the disclosure tool, the post would have been rejected under their Branded Content Policy. Notwithstanding that, at the time the content was posted, users were able to target their organic posts to age groups over the age of 18 by engaging the ‘Audience Controls’ toggle.","The ASA was concerned by Erdem Clinic’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. 1.& 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. The ASA first assessed whether the TikTok videos and Instagram stories were ads. We understood that Ms Bracewell had stated that she had not received payment from Erdem Clinic, and her relationship to them was a normal customer relationship. However, ads (a), (c), and (d) included the discount code “millieb” in the caption. Because ads (a), (c), and (d) included a personalised affiliate code, which would earn Ms Bracewell commission when used, they were marketing communications for the purposes of the CAP Code. Ad (b) did not include the discount code “millieb” in the caption. However, it was posted on the same day as ads (a) and (c), and was thus connected to Ms Bracewell’s affiliate relationship with Erdem Clinic. We therefore concluded that ads (a) to (d) were marketing communications. We then assessed whether the ads were obviously identifiable as such. Ads (a) and (c) were TikTok videos which featured Ms Bracewell and the Erdem hospital staff waving at the camera at various stages before and after she underwent surgery. Ad (c) included further clips from the operating room, and another shot in which Ms Bracewell waved at the camera and said “Thank you Erdem”. The captions in both ads featured the hashtags #erdemhospital and #turkeysurgery. Ad (c) further included in the caption ““I had an amazing experience at @Erdem Hospital definitely recommend to anyone wanting surgery! The quailty [sic] of care is phenomenal!”. We acknowledged that throughout the videos, the Erdem Hospital and ERDEM ESTHETIC logos respectively appeared in the top right-hand corner. We considered consumers would understand the videos as Ms Bracewell documenting her experience of surgery with Erdem Hospital and ERDEM ESTHETIC in Türkiye. However, in the absence of a clear and prominent identifier, such as “AD”, we considered that ads (a) and (c) did not make their commercial intent clear and were not obviously identifiable as marketing communications. Ads (b) and (d) were two further TikTok videos which featured Ms Bracewell documenting how she felt following her breast augmentation. Both ads included the hashtag #erdemhospital and #turkeysurgery in the captions. As above, we considered consumers would interpret ads (b) and (d) as accounts of Ms Bracewell’s experience of surgery with Erdem Hospital in Türkiye. However, in the absence of any clear and prominent identifiers in the videos or captions, such as “AD”, we considered that ads (b) and (d) did not make their commercial intent clear and were not obviously identifiable as marketing communications. On these points, ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.4 (Recognition of marketing communications). 3. Upheld The CAP Code required marketing communications to be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The CAP Guidance on the marketing of surgical and non-surgical cosmetic procedures further stated that ads should not trivialise cosmetic interventions or suggest that they be undertaken lightly. Ad (a) featured a viral soundbite from the movie Barbie, combined with a swiftly changing video sequence of Ms Bracewell, outside the hospital, into the hospital, in the operating room, and again outside the hospital. Ad (c) featured an upbeat pop song, with similar imagery as ad (a), and two additional shots of Ms Bracewell being measured by the surgeon, and then in the operating room, undergoing the surgery. Throughout the ads, Ms Bracewell and the hospital staff are shown smiling and in an upbeat mood. We considered the rapid succession of the images depicting the various stages oversimplified the process of undergoing a cosmetic intervention, suggesting it was quick and straightforward. Furthermore, because of the overall light-hearted tone of the ads, including the use of a Barbie soundbite and upbeat club-like music, and the cheerful visuals, we considered that the ads were likely to detract from the seriousness of the decision to undertake a cosmetic intervention and the seriousness of the surgery itself. We therefore concluded that the overall presentation of ads (a) and (c) trivialised the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery, and were thus irresponsible. On that point, ads (a) and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility). 4. Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications for cosmetic interventions must not be directed at those aged below 18 years through the selection of media or context in which they appeared. ‘Cosmetic interventions’ meant any intervention, procedure or treatment carried out with the primary objective of changing an aspect of a consumer’s physical appearance. That included surgical and non-surgical interventions, both invasive and non-invasive. Ads (a), (b), (c), and (d) were posted organically by Ms Bracewell. Organic posts on TikTok could be targeted away from under 18s by utilising the ‘Audience controls’ toggle, but Ms Bracewell had not done so. While we did receive analytics of Ms Bracewell’s adult followers on TikTok, we understood that it was not possible to obtain data on audiences under the age of 18. Ms Bracewell therefore could not confirm that under 18s did not form part of the ads’ audience. We also took into account the mechanics of TikTok and how content was shared with its users. We understood that TikTok’s “For You” page was the first page users saw after opening the app and the main way in which its users engaged with content. We further understood that this page was algorithmically driven, and therefore users would see content from accounts they did not follow but was likely to be of interest to them. Because of the way organic content was disseminated on TikTok via the “For You” page, ads for cosmetic interventions, such as breast augmentations, should have been appropriately restricted from viewing by under 18s. However, Erdem Clinic and Ms Bracewell had not used the targeting tools available to them to do so. As such, we considered that insufficient care had been taken to ensure that the ad was not directed at people under 18, and therefore breached the Code. On that point, ads (a), (b), (c), and (d) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.25 (Cosmetic interventions).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Erdem Clinic and Millie Bracewell to ensure that their future ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications, and the commercial intent was made clear, and that identifiers such as “#ad” were clearly and prominently displayed. We also told them to ensure that their ads were socially responsible, did not trivialise the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery, and were appropriately targeted. We referred Erdem Clinic to CAP’s Compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/erdem-clinic-a23-1209226-erdem-clinic.html
ASA Ruling on Eurostar International Ltd,,"A promotional email from Eurostar International, received on 15 July 2023, included the subject line “Soak up every second of summer”. In the body of the email large text stated “TREAT YOURSELF TO A EUROPEAN GETAWAY … FROM JUST £39 EACH WAY*”. Underneath that, further text stated “Make the most of the long days and sunny rays with a summer getaway in August or September. Book now to grab a bargain to Paris, Brussels or Lille.” A link underneath that text was labelled “LOW FARE FINDER”.","The complainant, who was only able to find one ticket from London to Paris at the advertised price, challenged whether the claim in the ad was misleading.","Eurostar International Ltd said that a total of 39,000 seats had been available at the advertised “from” price across the advertised routes. They believed that was a significant number of seats, and that consumers would therefore have had a reasonable chance of obtaining a seat at the advertised “from” price. They said that the terms and conditions of the promotion were prominently displayed directly underneath the main copy of the ad, including the numbers of seats which had been available at the advertised “from” price. They believed that meant the availability of seats at the advertised “from” price had not been exaggerated. They also said that the ad had only been sent to consumers once, which they thought reduced the risk of exaggerating the availability of tickets available at the advertised “from” price. Eurostar said they did not know when the complainant searched for a ticket, but that from 12 July 2023 onwards the number of available tickets at the stated price for travel to Paris in August and September would have decreased as tickets were sold. They believed that consumers would have expected to see a smaller number of the “from” priced seats available, as seats were sold during the promotion. They said that terms and conditions of the promotion had stated that tickets at the advertised price were subject to availability, and that they had not received any direct complaints about the promotion.","Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “TREAT YOURSELF TO A EUROPEAN GETAWAY FROM JUST £39 EACH WAY […] with a summer getaway in August or September” to mean that a significant proportion of fares to the advertised locations of Paris, Brussels or Lille would be available to purchase at £39 throughout August and September 2023. We also considered that consumers would expect to find the tickets available at the “from” price across a range of dates and times within that period, and that they would have a reasonable chance of obtaining a seat at the advertised price. The complainant had been unable to purchase tickets from London to Paris at the advertised price of £39, so we first assessed the availability of the “from” priced tickets for the return journey on that route. The terms and conditions of the promotion stated that, as of 12 July 2023, there had been 9,500 standard class seats available on both the outward and return journey at the stated “from” price, for travel between 16 August 2023 and 13 December 2023. Data provided by Eurostar in their response showed that the £39 fares had made up a very small percentage of available tickets for travel between London and Paris, and Paris and London. We therefore considered that Eurostar had not demonstrated that a significant proportion of tickets between London to Paris and Paris to London had been available “from” £39 during the promotional period.We then reviewed the number of seats available on the two other routes included in the promotion. The terms and conditions stated that as of 12 July 2023 there had been 6,500 seats available from London to Brussels and Lille, and 13,500 seats available from Brussels and Lille to London. Data provided by Eurostar again showed that the £39 fares had made up a very small percentage of the total number of seats available for standard class travel for those routes in the identified timeframe. We therefore considered that Eurostar had also not demonstrated that a significant proportion of tickets for the London to Brussels and Lille routes had been available “from” £39 during the promotional period. We acknowledged that the terms and conditions of the promotion had stated the number of seats available, and that they were subject to availability. However, because we considered that a significant proportion of tickets had not been available at the “from” price, we concluded that the claim “TREAT YOURSELF TO A EUROPEAN GETAWAY FROM JUST £39 EACH WAY […] with a summer getaway in August or September” was therefore misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), and 3.17 and 3.22 (Prices).","We told Eurostar International Ltd to ensure that when using “from""” price claims in future, a significant proportion of the advertised fares were available at the advertised price.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/eurostar-international-ltd-a23-1205614-eurostar-international-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Ben's Gutters Ltd,,"Four leaflets, from Ben’s Gutters, presented in the form of a compliment slip: a. The first leaflet from Ben’s Gutters Ltd, was delivered to homes in Powys, Carmarthenshire, Kent and Warwickshire in July 2023. Text which appeared to be handwritten stated “Hello, We are cleaning gutters in your area over the next few days. Maybe you would like yours cleaned too? Please call us on [mobile number] for an estimate. Best regards, Ben’s Gutters [smiley face]”. Small printed text included an 0800 phone number, website and email address, the company’s registered name and Companies House number and the text “A National company with a local presence Established 2010”. b. The second leaflet also from Ben’s Gutters Ltd, was delivered to homes in Norfolk, Gloucestershire, Kent and Cornwall in July and August 2023. It was the same as ad (a) except the handwritten-style text began “Hello, We are cleaning your close neighbours [sic] gutters over the next few days […]”. The mobile number was different to that in ad (a). c. The third leaflet, from Ben’s Gutters Scotland Ltd, was delivered to homes in Lanarkshire in June 2023. It featured the same handwritten-style text as ad (b), with a different mobile number. The small print featured a different 0800 phone number, website and email address and the registered name and Companies House number for Ben’s Gutters Scotland Ltd. It included the text “A National company with a local presence Established 2010”. d. The fourth leaflet, from Ben’s Gutters North Ltd, was delivered to a home in Durham in July 2023. It featured the same handwritten-style text as ads (b) and (c), but with another mobile number. The small print featured a 0161 phone number, the same website as in ads (a) and (b), and a different email address. It included the registered name and Companies House number for Ben’s Gutters North Ltd and the text “A National company with a local presence Established 2010”.","Thirty-two complainants, who believed the overall impression of the ads were that they were from a local tradesperson working in the area, challenged whether they were misleading.","Ben’s Gutters Ltd said they had contacted the CAP Copy Advice team and believed that by stating they were a national company with a local presence on the leaflets, they were following the advice they had been given. They believed that by stating explicitly that they were a national company, consumers would not be misled about the size of their company. They had used the handwritten style compliment slip for over 13 years, and it was a theme they used throughout their branding including on their vans, cherry pickers and websites. They also included details about their company, website, company registration numbers and VAT numbers on the leaflets, so that consumers could do additional checks. They understood that many of their customers, after receiving a leaflet, looked the company up online. Their Trustpilot page had 4,431 reviews, a number which they believed would be very unlikely for a small, individually run business.","Upheld The ASA considered the ads contained certain elements that gave recipients the impression that it was from a local, small business or tradesperson. In particular, the handwritten style of the text on a compliments slip, the informal and individual sounding company name “Ben’s Gutters”, the text “Please call us on [mobile number] for an estimate” and the apparently hand-drawn smiley face symbol after the sign-off. We acknowledged that the ads stated “A National company with a local presence”. However, that text appeared in the bottom right-hand corner, in typed text that was smaller than the main content of the ad. We also acknowledged that ads (a), (b) and (c) included a 0800 telephone number, and that all the ads included website and email addresses, a more formal version of the company name (“Ben’s Gutters Ltd”, “Ben’s Gutters Scotland Ltd” or “Ben’s Gutters North Ltd) and Companies House numbers. Ads (a), (b) and (d) also included a VAT number. We considered all of these were elements more likely to be associated with larger companies. However, we considered that these were insufficient to override the impression that the ads were from a small, independent, local business. We considered the principle of supporting a small, independent, local business was likely to be a significant factor in a consumer’s decision to respond to the ad. However, while we understood that the work was carried out by individual tradespeople who were local to their area, Ben’s Gutters was itself a larger company working in various parts of the country. Because we considered the ads gave the overall impression that they were for a local, small business or tradesperson, when that was not the case, we concluded that the ads were misleading. Ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).","The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of. We told Ben’s Gutters Ltd to ensure that their marketing communications did not, through their content or presentation, give the overall impression that they were for a local small business or tradesperson.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/ben-s-gutters-ltd-g23-1202318-ben-s-gutters-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on BrewDog plc,,"An Instagram post by Brewdog, published on 31 July 2023, featured an image of a poster, containing a childlike drawing of Earth covered in flames. Text accompanying the drawing stated “drink it for me” in the style of a child’s handwriting. Text on the other half of the poster stated “BEER FOR YOUR GRANDCHILDREN”, alongside an image of Brewdog Punk IPA Lager, and a badge with the text “Positive Planet CERTIFIED CARBON NEGATIVE COMPANY”. The caption stated “Beer for your Grandchildren. From the World’s First Carbon Negative brewery. Find out how we’re working to ensure we have a planet to enjoy beer on via the link in our bio”.",Two complainants challenged whether the ad was misleading because it failed to make the basis of the carbon negative claim clear.,"Brewdog highlighted that Instagram did not permit links to be included within the caption. Instead, they explained that the caption directed consumers to their Instagram “bio” which included a link to a web page detailing the basis of the claim, particularly: that carbon avoided or removed from the atmosphere resulting from their investment in nature based projects was greater than the carbon emitted in making their beer; plus statistics relating to BrewDog’s carbon reduction achievements and offsetting; and a link to BrewDog’s Positive Planet Carbon Negative Company Certificate. A further link was included on that page which explained Brewdog’s wider sustainability projects. They said that, given the small scale of the photo and the space and functionality constraints of Instagram, directing consumers to refer to a link in the “bio” for more information was standard practice and that consumers were accustomed to that. They re-iterated that the link explained the basis of the carbon negative claim contained in the ad and substantiated the claim. Furthermore, Brewdog emphasised that the image of the poster contained the Positive Planet certification, an independent organisation that had certified their carbon negative credentials. They further detailed that Positive Planet had used the Green House Gas Protocol, which was an internationally recognised methodology and approved by the UK government, to calculate their emissions. They believed that the clear reference to the Positive Planet certification in the ad provided an additional signpost which would guide consumers to an explanation of the ad’s claims. They explained that an internet search of “Brewdog Positive Planet” would direct consumers to various web pages which detailed the certification and provided a definition of carbon negative.","Upheld The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear and stated that unqualified claims could mislead if material information was omitted. CAP Guidance stated that advertisers should avoid using unqualified carbon neutral claims, and because information explaining the basis for those claims helped consumers’ understanding, such information should therefore not be omitted. It further stated that accurate information about whether (and the degree to which) the claim was based on active reduction carbon emissions or based on offsetting should be included in ads to ensure consumers understood the basis on which carbon neutrality was achieved. The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the ad that Brewdog was a carbon negative brewery, meaning that, as a business, they had a net effect of removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emitted. We considered, within that context, the text “BEER FOR YOUR GRANDCHILDREN” reinforced the carbon negative claim. However, we considered that there was no information provided in the ad which explained the basis of Brewdog’s “carbon negative” accreditation or the claim “BEER FOR YOUR GRANDCHILDREN”. Although we acknowledged that the ad referred consumers to a link for the Brewdog website which contained further information about their carbon reduction and offsetting project, we considered that the ad itself did not include information which explained the basis of the claim. Without that information, we considered that consumers would not have sufficient information to understand the basis of the environmental claims in the ad. We also noted the inclusion of the Positive Planet carbon negative badge within the image of the poster. Again, we considered that was not sufficient to make the basis of the environmental claim clear because it did not provide information in the ad on the basis for the “carbon negative” claim. We acknowledged Brewdog’s argument that, owing to space and functionality constraints, it was standard practice to direct consumers to links housed in the “bio” for further information. The claims appeared in an Instagram post, the caption of which was limited to 2,200 characters. We therefore did not consider the ad to be limited by space, and in any case, we considered the use of a completely unqualified “carbon negative” claim would be likely to mislead. Because there was no qualifying information in the ad which outlined the basis for Brewdog’s “carbon negative” claim, we concluded that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 11.1 (Environmental claims).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Brewdog Plc to ensure the basis of environmental claims was clear in future ads.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/brewdog-plc-g23-1210353-brewdog-plc.html
ASA Ruling on Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd,,"A prize promotion on the Cathay Pacific website www.cathaypacific.com, was seen on 4 June 2023. Text stated “We have 3,260 tickets to give away! Successful entries will be awarded one return Economy ticket from London Heathrow or Manchester to Hong Kong* […] *All taxes and surcharges are excluded, and are at the cost of the traveller"".","The complainant, who understood taxes and surcharges had to be paid in order to redeem the ticket, challenged whether the promotion breached the Code.","Cathay Pacific said that it would be clear to consumers after they had registered, correctly answered quiz questions, and received a ticket offer with redemption code, that successful entrants would need to pay all taxes and surcharges associated with the prize of a flight ticket. They stressed that was repeatedly and prominently made clear to consumers even before participants took part in the promotion. They highlighted that the complainant understood that taxes and surcharges would have to be paid, and therefore they believed that there was no false implication to the contrary.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that promoters must not falsely claim or imply that the consumer, on doing a particular act, would win a prize (or other equivalent benefit) if the consumer incurred a cost to claim the prize. The ASA understood that participants had to complete several quiz questions, and in the event that the answers to those questions were correct, the 3,260 prizes would be awarded to participants on a first-come first-serve basis. Successful participants would be awarded a return flight from the UK to Hong Kong, and they would be responsible for all taxes and surcharges that were applicable to the ticket. Whilst we acknowledged the ad made that condition clear from the outset, the Code nevertheless prohibited promotions where consumers incurred a cost to claim a prize. Because the only way to claim the prize was to pay the taxes and surcharges on the return flight, we concluded the promotion breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) 8.21.1 (Prize Promotions).",The promotion must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Cathay Pacific to ensure their future promotions did not imply that consumers would win a prize if they were required to incur a cost to claim the prize.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/cathay-pacific-airways-ltd-a23-1206687-cathay-pacific-airways-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts Ltd,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Charles Tyrwhitt, a clothing retailer, seen on 28 July 2023, featured an image of a print cotton shirt. Text on the post stated “[…] We’re proud to be a Carbon Neutral business”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad was misleading because it failed to make the basis of the claim “Carbon Neutral business” clear.,"Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts said that all claims they made about their carbon neutrality were factually correct. They said these claims were based on a report, achieved through a partnership with the sustainability consultancy Planet Mark and under the guidelines of PAS2060, the specification published by the British Standards Institution detailing how companies should demonstrate their carbon neutrality.","Upheld The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear and stated that unqualified claims could mislead if material information was omitted. CAP Guidance stated that advertisers should avoid using unqualified carbon neutral claims, and because information explaining the basis for those claims helped consumers’ understanding, such information should therefore not be omitted. It further stated that accurate information about whether (and the degree to which) the claim was based on an active reduction carbon emissions or based on offsetting should be included in ads to ensure consumers understood the basis on which carbon neutrality was achieved. The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the ad that Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts was a carbon neutral company, meaning that, as a business, they balanced the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere by an equivalent amount removed. Within that context, we considered consumers would understand that purchasing a Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts product would have a net neutral impact on carbon emissions and, therefore, climate change. However, we considered there was no information in the ad which explained the basis for Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts’ claim that they were a “carbon neutral business”. Although we acknowledged that Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts had based their claim on a report by a sustainability consultancy which they said demonstrated their carbon neutrality, we considered that they had not provided any qualifying information within the ad for the basis of the “carbon neutral” claim. Because there was no qualifying information in the ad which outlined the basis for the “carbon neutral” claim, which we considered was significant information that consumers needed to know in order to fully understand the claim’s meaning, we concluded that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 11.1 (Environmental claims).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Charles Tyrwhitt Shirts Ltd to ensure that the basis of future environmental claims were clear.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/charles-tyrwhitt-shirts-ltd-a23-1210029-charles-tyrwhitt-shirts-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Coty UK Ltd t/a Coty UK Ltd,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Rimmel London, seen on 9 September 2023, included the caption “Get ready to slay this back to school season [books emoji] [stars emoji] Get 25% off Multi-Tasker Concealer and other Rimmel faves with code B2S25 only at lookfantastic.com”. The post included a video of influencer Lana Jenkins applying makeup and a product shot of Rimmel’s “THE MULTI-TASKER CONCEALER”. The video included large on-screen text that stated “CONTOURED QUEEN”. Underneath the video, text stated “LOOKFANTASTIC.COM 25% off Rimmel back to school” and included a button labelled “Shop Now”.","Two complainants, who believed the claim “Get ready to slay this back to school season” played on young girls’ insecurities by implying they were only ready for a new school year if they wore make-up, challenged whether the ad was irresponsible.","Coty UK Ltd t/a Rimmel London (Rimmel) said that the campaign in no way communicated a need to wear make-up, but rather focused on trending make-up looks which the viewer could re-create should they wish. The ad was part of their “Back to School” campaign and contained video content created by their paid ambassador, Lana Jenkins who was 25. The ad was intended to refer more generally to the period of time starting in September for anyone going back to work including, for example, university students, mums and teachers. The ad targeted women aged 18-35 years in the UK interested in cosmetics, beauty, fashion and make-up. They provided targeting data to demonstrate that. Additionally their own internal guidelines specified that they did not market to children. The term “slay” was commonly used amongst their target audience and they believed it to be a positive term which meant to do something spectacularly well. The claim “Get ready to slay this back-to-school season” was intended to motivate and build confidence, rather than prey on young girls’ insecurities. They acknowledged that some people viewed make-up in a negative light, but they highlighted that make-up could also be liberating by allowing people to express themselves and look and feel amazing. They confirmed that the “Back to School” marketing campaign had ended and that they had no current intentions to use the ad in future marketing activities.","Upheld The CAP Code required marketing communications be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. We acknowledged Rimmel’s comment that “back to school season” could refer to university students, mums and teachers, which they said were their intended target, and not just school and college aged children and young people. However, the ASA considered that the words “back to school season” in this ad, in conjunction with the vibrant pink colour scheme, the books and star emojis and the fluffy pink pen held by Ms Jenkins in the video, would primarily be understood by viewers as referring to the time of the year when students return to senior school or sixth form college after the summer break and would be perceived as speaking to that age group, and would have appeal to them. Although make-up was not an age-restricted product, we noted that Rimmel had used age- and interest-based targeting tools to target the ad away from under-18s. However, those targeting tools would not have the effect of avoiding all under-18s from seeing the ad and we therefore considered whether the content of the ad was irresponsible for that audience. We considered that the use of the word “slay” in the claim ""Get ready to slay this back to school season"" implied that girls or young women were more likely to succeed or do well when they went back to school if they wore make-up, in this case a concealing and contouring product. We considered the ad had the effect of playing on young girls’ insecurities about their appearance and therefore concluded it was irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social Responsibility).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Coty UK Ltd t/a Rimmel London that they should not play on young girls’ insecurities by implying that it was necessary to wear make-up to school to succeed.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/coty-uk-ltd-g23-1213377-coty-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on EFL Digital Ltd t/a EFL,,"Two online calendar events for The English Football League (EFL) and Papa John’s: a. The first calendar event, seen on 21 October 2022, featured the headline “[football emoji] Papa Johns Trophy: Stevenage vs Tottenham Hotspur U21”. Text within the event stated “We’ve partnered with Papa Johns to offer fans 50% off pizza! Simply show your EFL season or match ticket to staff in a Papa Johns store for half price on your pizza order! [football emoji] + [ticket emoji] = [pizza emoji]”. b. The second calendar event, seen on 21 October 2022, featured the headline “[football emoji] Papa Johns Trophy: Burton Albion vs Bradford City” and contained the same text within the event as ad (a).","Sustain's Children's Food Campaign, who understood that the promotion had been received by an individual registered with an under-16 age, challenged whether the ads were for products that were high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS product ads) that were directed at children through the selection of media or context in which they appeared.","EFL Digital Ltd t/a EFL clarified that Papa John’s were appointed title sponsor of the Papa John’s Trophy football competition in October 2020 and continued to fulfil that status. As part of that agreement, Papa John’s were entitled to a range of branding and advertising opportunities. Whilst the promotion formed part of the contractual framework with Papa John's, the EFL confirmed that the promotion was not mandated as part of the contract, and as such, did not consider it was paid-for advertising. They further stated that the calendar entries had not included such promotional messages until September 2022. The EFL explained that the ads were delivered as part of an agreement with a service provider which enabled users to subscribe to have event related information relevant to their chosen Club or specific EFL competition synced with their chosen e-calendar free of charge. The EFL specified that the promotional message appeared in all synced calendar entries relating to the Papa John’s Trophy fixtures to all subscribers from week commencing 5 September 2022 to 14 November 2022. The promotional message was removed as a result of a complaint of a different nature that was made directly to the EFL. They confirmed that the promotion included in the ads complained of had been removed prior to being made aware of the complaint from the ASA. They said they had no intention to reinstate the promotion within similar ads. The EFL said that the opportunity to sync fixtures to an individual’s e-calendar was not intended for specific appeal to those under the age of 16. Since May 2021, all those wishing to subscribe had been required to supply their date of birth, and if they were unable to demonstrate that they were 13 years old or older, they were unable to sync the events to their calendar. They explained that the ages of users were collected to comply with the minimum age by which consent could be obtained from a minor for offer of access to information society services pursuant to the Data Protection Act 2018. They re-iterated that they did not review the data collected as part of the pre-subscription form to determine whether an individual should receive the promotional message from Papa John’s in their synced calendar events. Rather, every individual who subscribed downloaded the same fixture entries and the accompanying promotional message for the applicable football matches. Consequently, they highlighted that targeting tools were not available to distinguish between users at the point of syncing the calendar information. With that in mind, they explained that there were two possible methods to prevent under-16s from receiving the promotional message; either operating two versions of the downloadable fixtures, one for under-16s and one for over-16s, or syncing additional calendar invites which included the promotional message and were delivered to over-16s only. However, they believed that those options were not feasible for a variety of reasons, such as poor user experience, that it would be unduly burdensome to administer, and that it would rely solely on self-declared ages. Because of that, they suggested seeking to exclude under 16s from receiving the promotional message went beyond what would have been a “reasonable step” to expect of a marketer. The EFL noted CAP Guidance stated that the approach adopted by advertisers to exclude under-16s from the audience of HFSS ads varied according to the type of online media used, the targeting tools available, and the context of the ad placement. They believed that, whilst the guidance was clear in relation to a number of contexts, such as websites and social media, that they were unsure how the guidance applied to downloaded calendar events. They also highlighted that the guidance did not expressly state what approach should be taken in the context of a download that synced to a calendar or other similar media. They further believed it was unclear whether such media could be classified as direct marketing and, therefore, that it was not appropriate to treat the ads as being analogous to “a mailing list for direct or email marketing”. Therefore, they understood that because they held evidence that the number of under-16s was significantly less than 25% of their total audience of subscribers, they considered that it was not necessary to exclude all of those under 16 years old from receiving the promotional message. The EFL further detailed the data which they considered demonstrated that the number of under-16s subscribed to the calendar syncing was marginal. Their subscriber database indicated that 0.02% of those who had signed up since May 2021 were under the age of 16. They acknowledged that those who subscribed prior to May 2021, when the requirement for users to confirm a date of birth was introduced, may still sync fixtures to their e-calendar. However, they considered that because the proportion of those under 16 was so low, it did not indicate a significant number of subscribers were under-16. They also shared that 0.08% of their fans were identified to be under the age of 16 across the entire EFL Digital customer relations database, which included data derived from Club and EFL newsletters, audio-visual streaming services, and the fixture syncing service. They re-iterated that because there was only a marginal number of under-16s who were subscribed to the fixture syncing, they considered that the promotional message was not directed at under-16s through the selection of media and the audience did not consist of more than 25% of under-16s. Papa John’s agreed with the reasoning set out by EFL and, as such, did not consider that the ads were directed at children either through the medium or context in which they appeared. They highlighted that they did not intend for the ads to be specifically targeted at under-16s. They confirmed that they created the advertising copy, but due to the contractual framework between the EFL and Papa John’s, they explained that they did not have control over the way in which the ads were distributed. Furthermore, they said that, because they did not have access to the EFL’s subscriber data, they were not able to take an independent decision about whether under-16s would be included in that audience.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that HFSS product advertisements must not be directed at people under 16 through the selection of media or the context in which they appear and that no medium should be used to advertise HFSS products, if more than 25% of its audience is under 16 years of age. The ads were synced calendar events for upcoming fixtures in the EFL and featured a promotional offer applicable to all pizzas available in-store at Papa John’s. We understood that the range of pizzas offered by Papa John’s were HFSS products and, as such, considered that the promotional messages were ads for HFSS products for the purposes of the Code. CAP Guidance stated that if data was used to create an audience, for example a mailing list for direct or email marketing, marketers must ensure they had taken all reasonable steps to exclude under-16s from the list or targeting criteria. Anyone with a date of birth that meant they were under-16 should be removed. In instances where that information was available to advertisers, it was not sufficient to show that less than 25% of the audience was under 16 years of age. We understood that as part of the sign-up form for the online calendar events users were required to share their date of birth. Whilst we acknowledged EFL’s argument that the ads were synced calendar events, which were not based on a mailing list, we considered that they had access to that data and were able to remove under-16s from the audience that received the promotional message. They had chosen to allow syncing of the calendar to those who were 13 years old or over, which meant that those who were aged between 13 and 15 years of age were allowed access to the fixture events containing the Papa John’s promotional message. We also considered that, because they were able to prevent under-13s from syncing the ads, data had been used to create an audience and it would have been possible to prevent under-16s from receiving the promotional message. We were not supplied with the number of under-16s who downloaded the fixture events containing the promotional message. Nevertheless, we understood that 0.02% of those who had signed up to sync football fixtures to their e-calendar since May 2021 were under-16. The ads, which contained promotional offers for HFSS products, had therefore been sent to a number of individuals under the age of 16. For that reason, we considered the EFL and Papa John’s had not taken reasonable steps to exclude under-16s from the audience, and that the ads had been directed at children through the selection of media in which they appeared. We therefore concluded that they breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 15.18 (HFSS Product Ad Placement).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Papa John’s and EFL Digital Ltd t/a EFL to ensure that HFSS product ads were not directed at children through the selection of media or the context in which they appeared.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/efl-digital-ltd-a22-1172914-efl-digital-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Equinor ASA,,"A national press ad for energy company Equinor, seen in June 2023, stated “Wind, oil, gas, carbon capture […]” and “IT’S ALL PART OF THE BROADER ENERGY PICTURE”. A footnote at the bottom of the ad stated “Equinor has been delivering energy solutions to the UK for 40 years, and we are now working to help the UK achieve a smooth energy transition […] we’re producing the oil and gas the UK needs now; and will be powering millions more homes with wind, capturing and storing carbon safely […]. It’s broad energy for a brighter future”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad was misleading because it omitted significant information about the overall environmental impact of Equinor’s business activities.,"Equinor ASA said the ad was part of a targeted brand campaign intended to build awareness of their company, which had been operating in the UK for 40 years. The ad highlighted Equinor’s contributions to the UK beyond oil and gas, including their renewable energy and carbon capture activities. They said the ad was a one-off that had been published in The Economist magazine. It did not advertise any consumable product or service, and was not aimed at the general public, but at decision-makers and their influencers, a group that included politicians in government and opposition, as well as advisors and journalists. They said that group would not make decisions based solely on the information featured in the ad, and would carry out their own due diligence, which could include scrutinising Equinor’s policies and plans. Equinor said the ad did not feature subjective or vague terms, and stated facts about the fields in which Equinor was involved, and signalled their recognition that a transition towards cleaner fuels was necessary and would occur. The transition to cleaner energy required investment, innovation, and a broad mix of energy sources, and that it was essential to strike a balance between providing energy security while also enabling that transition. Equinor highlighted that the words “oil” and “gas” appeared prominently in the ad, and the text at the bottom of the ad stated they were “producing the oil and gas the UK needs now”. Additionally, it featured an image of an oil and gas worker on an oil rig, looking out to another oil rig. The ad did not engage in a discussion of the merits or environmental impact of oil and gas production versus energy from wind power or carbon capture and storage. Its aim was to show that Equinor was engaged in a broad energy mix, and illustrated the activities in which Equinor was involved. Equinor’s ambition was to become net zero by 2050. To that end, they were engaged in cutting emissions from oil and gas production and developing new technology to accelerate decarbonisation. They were also leveraging digitalisation and technology to reduce production emissions and the carbon footprint of their offshore oil and gas production. They were a partner and operator in the Sherringham Shoal, Dudgeon, Hywind Scotland, and Dogger Bank windfarms – the latter of which was still under construction – and a partner-licence holder in the Endurance Carbon Capture and Storage hub. They were also involved in several UK projects to decarbonise heavily industrialised regions such as the Humber, Teeside, and Peterhead – for example, their H2H Saltend Project that would supply local industry and power plants with hydrogen and feature a small onsite CCS facility, as well as plans to build additional hydrogen production capacity in the Humber by the end of the decade. They said they had taken advice from the CAP Copy Advice team.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that unqualified environmental claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. The ad appeared in The Economist magazine, which was read by consumer and business readers, as well as politicians and public policy professionals. The ASA therefore considered members of those groups were the ad’s likely audience. While the ad was not for a directly purchasable product or service, we considered it was likely to raise Equinor’s profile and influence readers’ opinions of Equinor as a brand by increasing awareness of their activities and plans in the UK. Readers of The Economist were likely to have an awareness that many companies in carbon-intensive industries, including the oil and gas sector, were in the process of investing in renewable alternatives to fossil fuels to help governments, businesses, and consumers reduce their emissions in response to the climate crisis and in their transition to net zero. Those who were concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon energy sources would be interested in seeking out, supporting, or promoting businesses, including oil and gas companies, who were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services, including those investing in renewable energy production, such as wind farms, and technology such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, ads were likely to mislead if they exaggerated the contribution that lower-carbon initiatives played, or would play in the near future, as part of the overall balance of a company's activities when making claims about green initiatives. The ad featured an image of a worker on an oil rig, with another oil rig visible in the distance. Text in the body of the ad included “Wind, oil, gas, carbon capture”, and further text at the bottom of the ad stated “we’re producing the oil and gas the UK needs now; and will be powering millions more homes with wind, capturing and storing carbon safely”. We considered the overall impression of the ad was that Equinor’s current and near future business activities in the UK included providing energy sourced from a mix of fossil fuels such as oil and gas, and renewable sources such as wind, as well as capturing and storing carbon dioxide. The claim “Wind, oil, gas, carbon capture”, gave equal prominence to each of those activities. In the absence of sufficient qualifying information that, together with the further text at the bottom of the ad, was likely to be interpreted to mean that CCS and energy sourced from windfarms formed a significant proportion of Equinor’s current and near future activities, alongside oil and gas. We understood Equinor were a partner-investor in several UK windfarms, and were involved in several CCS projects in the north-east of the UK. Equinor’s 2022 Integrated Annual Report (the Report) stated that their total scope 1 and 2 operated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 11.4 million tonnes CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent). Equinor also held significant interests in international oil fields, including the UK’s Rosebank oil field, in which it held a 40% stake, which had increased to 80% in 2023. We understood from the report that their oil and gas production stood at around 2,039 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022. Additionally, the Report stated that in 2022 their capital expenditure on renewable investments stood at 14%, growing to 30% by 2025. Furthermore, we understood from the Report that large-scale global oil and gas investment and extraction formed the vast majority of Equinor’s business activities and would continue to do so in the near future. While the ad was clear that the UK energy blend was in transition, it gave the overall impression that CCS and energy sourced from windfarms formed a significant proportion of Equinor’s business activities, alongside oil and gas. We therefore considered further information about the overall proportion of Equinor’s business model that comprised renewable energy and CCS was material information that should have been included. Because the ad did not include that information, we concluded it omitted significant information and was therefore likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 11.1 (Environmental claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Equinor ASA to ensure their future ads featuring environmental claims did not mislead by omitting significant information about the proportion of their business activities that comprised renewable energy and CCS, or the role those activities played in their current business.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/equinor-asa-a23-1204534-equinor-asa.html
ASA Ruling on GMG Pharmacy Ltd t/a The IV Clinic,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on advertising claims about the health benefits of intravenous nutritional therapy (IVNT), identified for investigation following complaints received and intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 20 December 2023. When the ASA received the complaint the advertiser’s registered company name was The IV Clinic (NW) Ltd. During the course of the ASA’s investigation the registered company name was changed to GMG Pharmacy Ltd.","The website for The IV Clinic, www.iv.ghoshmedicalgroup.com, seen 1 April 2019, featured a section on its homepage titled “IV DRIPS MENU” which listed the intravenous (IV) drips services it offered: “ANTI-AGEING Hair, Nail & Skin Support”; “GLUTA GLOW Brighter, Clearer Skin”; “THE RED CARPET Hydration & Energy”; “DIET & DETOX Detox/Fat Burning”; “BODY BUILDER Muscle Builder”; “AFTER FIGHTER Muscle Recovery”; “PRE-FIGHTER Energy Release”; “THE BURNER Burst of Energy”; “CLASSIC MYERS’ The original IV”; “IMMUNO-BOOST Immunity Support”; and “THE CALMER Calm your mind”. Hovering the cursor over the name of each drip brought up additional claims about its health benefits.",The complainant challenged whether the claimed health benefits of the IV drips were misleading and could be substantiated.,"GMG Pharmacy Ltd t/a The IV Clinic said the IV drips they used were manufactured by the company IntraVita and contained high doses of vitamins and amino acids naturally present in the human diet. They provided a copy of the IntraVita training manual and a Public Health England document titled ""Government Dietary Recommendations,"" which laid out government recommendations for energy and nutrients. The IV Clinic said they conducted full blood tests for patients before recommending an IV drip and only highly trained staff administered the drips. They said that GMG Pharmacy Ltd no longer provided IV drips to the general public; the service was instead provided by Ghosh Medical Ltd, trading as Ghosh Medical Group. They had made amendments to Ghosh Medical Group’s advertising as a result of the ASA’s investigation. The IV Clinic said the Anti-Ageing drip contained biotin (vitamin B7), which research had indicated could encourage healthier hair, nails, and skin. They did not provide further details of the contents of the drip, although the ad suggested it contained biotin and proline. To support the advertising claims, they provided copies of four studies, six literature reviews, a medical journal article, and a news article, which variously related to vitamin B7, B vitamins generally, vitamin C, amino acids (particularly leucine), magnesium, calcium, and lipoic acid. In relation to the Classic Myers’ drip, they said studies showed that B vitamins could help boost energy levels. They said the drip contained vitamins B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12, magnesium chloride-hexahydrate, calcium chloride-dihydrate, calcium chloride, sodium selenite-pentahydrate, and zinc. In support of the advertising claims, they provided a journal article about the history of the Myers’ Cocktail (an IV infusion developed by a US physician), a report of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) relating to the Myers’ Cocktail, and an RCT relating to zinc magnesium aspartate (ZMA). They also provided a review of evidence regarding how levels of selenium might affect different types of immunity. In relation to the Immuno Boost drip, they said research suggested that when an individual was deficient in vitamins such as C, D, and A, their immunity might be compromised. They said the drip contained vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12, and lysine, cystine, ornithine, and taurine. They provided two RCTs, an in vitro study, a literature review, and a journal article. They also provided an observational study on the effects of IV vitamin C on the quality of life of cancer patients, and a review of evidence relating to the role of vitamin C in infection and immunity. The IV Clinic said the Gluta Glow drip contained ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and glutathione. They referred to the literature review relating to the role of vitamin C in skin health referenced above in relation to the Anti-Ageing drip and provided copies of an RCT and literature review relating to the use of glutathione for skin lightening. The IV Clinic did not provide details of the contents of the Red Carpet drip, although they provided one RCT and three literature reviews, relating to collagen and proline, water, and vitamins B6, B9, and B12, in support of their advertising claims. The IV Clinic also did not provide details of the contents of the Diet & Detox drip, although the ad referenced “a blend of nutrients, vitamin[sic], and amino acids.” They provided a copy of an article about the medical management of constipation, a review of research into amino acid supplementation and metabolic health, and a review looking at the role of the amino acid arginine in the body. They also referred to the review looking at the role of arginine in the body in relation to the Burner drip, as well as copies of two conference papers that summarised evidence relating to the metabolic roles of the amino acid leucine and its potential role in weight loss diets; a review of evidence relating to niacin as a treatment for lipoprotein abnormalities; and a meta-analysis of evidence relating to the effects of inositol supplementation on lipid profiles in people with metabolic diseases. The IV Clinic said the Body Builder drip contained vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12, and lysine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, glycine, carnitine, and methionine. They provided copies of two RCTs, which looked at the potential role of leucine-rich amino acid supplementation in addressing muscle wasting in the elderly, and a study which investigated indicators, other than BMI, for the propensity for obese women to develop metabolic disorders. They did not provide details of the contents of the Pre-Fighter drip, but referred to the previously referenced review looking at the role of arginine in the body and an RCT looking at the effect of ZMA supplementation in resistance-trained men, as well as an article summarising the role of folate (vitamin B9) in the body and the levels required to avoid deficiency. With regard to the After Fighter drip, they did not provide details of its contents but provided copies of a study looking at the effects of a topical gel containing hyaluronic acid and amino acids, and an RCT which investigated collagen and muscle protein synthesis after exercise that they had also provided in relation to the Red Carpet drip. They did not give details of the contents of the Calmer drip but provided an RCT which investigated the role of dopamine in depression, and a study looking at resistance to seizures in mice that were fed taurine.","The ad described 12 IV drips offered by The IV Clinic, including a range of claims about the health benefits provided by each drip. In the descriptions of the drips, the ad also included claims about the role that some of the specific substances in the drips played in the body and the health benefits they provided. The ASA considered that consumers would therefore understand that the health benefits associated with those specific substances would be provided by the described drip. We considered that the average consumer who viewed the web page relating to the advertiser’s IV drips, and to whom the claims were clearly addressed, would be generally healthy but interested in products which might support or enhance specific aspects of their health and wellbeing, or support their preparation for or recovery from specific events, including intensive exercise. We considered those consumers would have some understanding that the body required certain levels of vitamins, minerals, and other substances to support its normal functioning. We noted that the ad included a section at the bottom of the web page, headed “A NUTRITIONAL APPROACH TO IV THERAPY” which included the subheadings “How Effective Is an IV Drip?” and “What Are the Benefits?”. Bullet points summarised the health benefits that were referred to in the descriptions of the individual IV drips. Text stated that the drips contained vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and amino acids which could not be produced by the body on its own (known as ‘essential nutrients’), that “Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet is difficult, leaving many people lacking in some essential nutrients”, that “up to 85%” of the active ingredients of oral supplements were rendered “useless” by the digestive process, that IV drips achieved “up to 100% absorption and at a much higher level of concentration” and that “By the time illness, disease or tissue damage manifests, it is often too late for oral vitamins & minerals to make an effective change for the better. Intravenous […] therapies provide the quickest route to provide the bodies[sic] cells with maximum nutrition to achieve optimal cell health”. IV drips were delivered via an invasive method which we considered consumers would generally associate with medical uses, and single drips were offered by IV clinics in the UK at prices generally ranging from around £100 to around £400. At the time the ads were viewed, The IV Clinic’s prices ranged from £180 to £550 for a single drip. In that context, and in the context of the claims referenced above, we considered consumers were likely to expect that an IV drip was an instantaneous, and therefore more effective or superior way, of delivering essential nutrients to normally healthy people than other methods (such as through diet or regular oral supplementation) and therefore would also provide superior health benefits more quickly than the same nutrients administered through such other methods. We considered consumers would understand that the nutrients delivered via a single IV drip would result in a one-off increase in the availability of those nutrients to be utilised by the body, whereas diet and oral supplementation provided a daily regular, ongoing source of those nutrients. However, consumers would be unlikely to have knowledge of how long the various nutrients administered via a single IV drip would be available for utilisation by the body or how long the claimed health benefit might therefore last. As a result, they were likely to base their understanding of how long the health benefit might last on information in the ad, where relevant information was included. This could include, for example, references to a course of drips or recommended frequency of administration, the overall impression created by the claims, the name of the drip, or other elements of the ad. We understood that human nutritional needs were complex, requiring different amounts of different nutrients at differing frequencies to ensure normal functioning of the body, and these needs varied from person to person depending on a range of factors such as biological sex, age, levels of physical activity, and so on. Human nutritional needs were answered through diet and, in the case of vitamin D, exposure to the sun. We took expert advice on what type and standard of evidence would be relevant to claims about the health benefits of IVNT drips. The expert firstly referenced evidence for advertising claims about the health benefits of IVNT drips which did not include that IVNT would provide superior health benefits compared to diet or oral supplementation. For such claims, they advised that evidence relating to the health benefits of oral supplementation could be relevant to support claims relating to IVNT. Such evidence would, however, have to provide robust evidence of the correlation between a particular dose of a nutrient (i.e. the quantity provided, frequency of provision, and duration of provision) and a particular health benefit. The IVNT drip would have to be of the same or greater dose than the oral supplement. The advertiser would have to demonstrate that the particular formulation of the drip did not include other nutrients or components which could adversely affect the effectiveness of the key nutrient (e.g. amino acids that bound to zinc or copper). They would also have to demonstrate that interaction with the gut microbiome was not necessary to achieve the health benefit, which may be the case for some nutrients such as polyphenols and glucosinolates. The expert secondly referenced evidence for advertising claims that IVNT would provide superior health benefits compared to other methods of administration of the same nutrients such as through diet or oral supplementation. IV administration would achieve peak plasma concentrations of a substance more quickly than oral administration, although the speed at which this was achieved would vary between nutrients. It also achieved 100% bioavailability under the pharmacological definition (the fraction of the administered drug that reached the systemic circulation), but there was a lack of consensus as to the definition of bioavailability in relation to nutrients. Consequently, they considered there was not sufficient evidence to support assertions that IVNT offered superior bioavailability compared to oral administration for all nutrients. For claims that IVNT would provide superior health benefits to other methods of administration, they advised that evidence would need to relate to the immediate and superior efficacy of the specific drips the advertiser sold, or substances contained in them. Such evidence would ideally consist of appropriately designed RCTs comparing the health benefit effects of IVNT with a placebo drip and with oral supplementation with the same formulation and at the same dose. Alternatively, such evidence could consist of appropriately designed observational studies comparing reported or measured health end-points of users of IVNT with individuals who routinely took the same nutrients in a different form, at similar doses. Those studies would also have to be adequately controlled in terms of inclusion criteria and other likely mitigating variables. Such evidence should have clinically significant outcomes that were directly relevant to the health benefits claimed in the advertising. Evidence relating to the health benefits of regular oral supplementation would not be sufficient, but evidence relating to intramuscular injection could be, as its mode of delivery was similar to IV drip. The expert further advised that evidence relating to the effects of nutrients on individuals suffering from a deficiency of that nutrient would not be relevant to claims about the health benefits of IVNT in normally healthy individuals, regardless of the method by which the nutrient was administered. Evidence relating to the effects of nutrients on individuals suffering from a medical condition that was not a nutrient deficiency could be adequate to support claims about the health effects of IVNT, whichever method of administration was used. However, such evidence would have to show that the provision of the nutrient led to improvements in a measure that was not related to the medical condition or to symptoms caused by side effects of any ongoing medical treatment. The expert understood that such evidence was likely to be scant. The ASA understood that IV administration delivered 100% of a nutrient to the systemic circulation and achieved peak plasma concentrations more swiftly than via oral supplementation. However, we understood that the speed at which peak plasma concentration would be achieved varied between nutrients, and that a range of other factors, including the composition of the particular IV drip formulation, could affect the body’s use of those nutrients and the delivery of any health benefits. We considered the type and standard of evidence we would expect to see, taking into account the context of how consumers would interpret the advertising claims as outlined above: that IVNT would provide a superior way of delivering essential nutrients to normally healthy people than other methods and therefore would also provide superior health benefits more quickly than the same nutrients administered through such other methods. We therefore expected to see evidence which related to the immediate and superior efficacy of the specific drips sold by the advertiser, or drips with the same formulation and dosage as referenced in the ad (including regularity of administration), preferably in humans who were normally healthy. Evidence relating to people with a clinical nutrient deficiency or which examined the effects of a nutrient as a treatment for a medical condition would not be relevant to advertising claims directed at generally healthy consumers. Evidence relating to people with a medical condition would only be relevant if it clearly established that the measures by which health benefits were assessed were unrelated to either the medical condition or to symptoms caused by associated medical treatments. We expected all evidence, whether consisting of RCTs or observational studies, to be methodologically robust with clinically significant outcomes that were directly relevant to the health benefits claimed in the advertising. The IntraVitra training manual provided by The IV Clinic included references to evidence which related to the health benefits of substances included in their drips. However, a section of the manual, titled Efficacy, stated, “Evidence of intravenous nutrient therapy (IVNT) efficacy is based mainly on anecdotal clinical experience with limited clinical trial publications on combination intravenous micronutrient therapy in peer review [sic] journals.” It then briefly summarised evidence which related to the use of IVNT in treating the medical conditions fibromyalgia, asthma, and cardiovascular disease, and of oral supplementation in aiding wound healing. As referenced above, we considered that evidence which related to the use of a nutrient as a treatment for a medical condition, including by oral supplementation, was not relevant to the claims in The IV Clinic’s advertising, which related to the efficacy of IVNT in normally healthy individuals. We further considered that anecdotal accounts of clinical experience were not adequate to support claims that IVNT had immediate and discernible health benefits for normally healthy individuals. In addition to documentation provided by The IV Clinic in support of their advertising, we also reviewed other relevant evidence we had seen which related to the claims in their advertising. The description of the Anti-Ageing drip stated, “Hair, Nail & Skin Support. Maximum support for collagen and elastin, helping to nourish, rehydrate and leave you with great looking skin. Biotin is used for strengthening hair and nails – excellent for those worried over thinning hair or brittle nails. Proline helps the body break down proteins for use in creating healthy cells in the body. It is essential to the development and maintenance of healthy skin and connective tissues […]”. We considered consumers would understand from those claims that the drip would have a general anti-ageing effect on the body and particularly on hair, skin, and nails, including that it would strengthen hair and nails, which would result in hair and nails breaking less, as well as reduced hair loss. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. The IV Clinic said the drip contained vitamin B7 and proline, but also provided documents relating to vitamin C, magnesium, calcium, lipoic acid, and B vitamins generally. The claims in the ad did not relate to the effects of ageing on cognition, so a literature review on the role of B vitamins in cognition and ageing was not relevant. A literature review surrounding the roles of vitamin C in skin health compared the efficacy of oral supplementation to that of topical application, but did not refer to any research into the efficacy of IV vitamin C, and it summarised that there was little evidence concerning a relationship between vitamin C and general skin ageing although there was some evidence that general good nutrition led to better skin condition. Two small RCTs on women with hair loss related to the efficacy of an oral supplement, which we understood contained vitamin C and magnesium stearate as well as other substances. However, because the effects described in both studies related to a specific oral supplement rather than to IV drips, we considered they were not adequate to support claims to strengthen hair or reduce hair loss. Two literature reviews focused on the possible role of vitamin C in combatting oxidative stress and how that could affect the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Because those documents related to the role of substances in the treatment or prevention of medical conditions rather than to health benefits in generally healthy people, we considered they were not relevant to support the claims in the ad. A short medical journal article discussing in vitro studies relating to magnesium deficiency and ageing was not adequate evidence as we were not able to assess the methodology or findings of the research described, and it related to in vitro findings and to deficiency. An RCT relating to the effect of oral magnesium supplementation on physical performance in healthy elderly women related to physical performance and did not relate to efficacy of magnesium as delivered by IV drip. A literature review relating to the role of calcium in human ageing supported the importance of achieving sufficient calcium intake, but advocated doing so through diet rather than oral supplementation and did not refer to IV drips. An in vitro study which related specifically to the possible role of calcium in certain cells in the heart was not relevant to support the anti-ageing claims in the ad. A short literature review on the metabolism of amino acids and their regulatory effects on ageing focused on the potential ways that amino acid metabolism could be improved in the elderly, but it was not adequate or relevant to support claims that amino acids, delivered by IV drip, could have an anti-ageing effect. We considered that a news article, describing research conducted on mice into lipoic acid as an anti-ageing compound relating to research conducted on animals, was not adequate evidence to support the claims in the ad, both because it related to research conducted on animals and because it was a news article. We concluded we had not seen adequate evidence to support the claims that the Anti-Ageing drip would have a general anti-ageing effect on the body and on hair, skin, and nails, including that it would strengthen hair and nails resulting in hair and nails breaking less, and reduced hair loss, over any time period. The description of the Classic Myers’ drip stated, “[…] Good for mood, energy and general immunity […] The ‘Myers’ cocktail as it is now known, is a specific combination of nutrients including vitamin C, calcium, magnesium and a complex of various B vitamins”. We considered consumers would understand that the particular combination of substances in the drip would help to maintain good mood and mental wellbeing, provide an increase in energy levels, and improve a person’s immune resistance to infection and disease. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. The IV Clinic said the Classic Myers’ drip contained vitamins B2, B3, B5, B6 and B12, magnesium chloride-hexahydrate, calcium chloride-dihydrate, calcium chloride, sodium selenite-pentahydrate, and zinc. The ad also referenced vitamin C as being included in the Myers’ Cocktail formulation. We therefore reviewed documents relating to all those substances. The IV Clinic had provided two documents relating to the use of the Myers’ Cocktail for health. The journal article provided anecdotal accounts of a doctor’s experience of using the Myers’ Cocktail in his treatment of patients with a range of medical conditions. This included a reference to the IV infusion providing an “energy boost” for an athlete, but this was in the context of the drip being administered as a treatment for a flu-like illness. One of the accounts related to the treatment of a man who presented with depression and anxiety. An RCT examined the safety, feasibility and efficacy of the Myers’ Cocktail in treating fibromyalgia. We considered that anecdotal evidence of a doctor’s experience was not adequate, and evidence relating to the role of substances in the treatment of medical conditions was not relevant, in supporting the advertising claims. In relation to the claim the drip could improve a person’s immune resistance to disease and infection, we had seen a range of evidence about the role of vitamin C. A literature review described the chemical and biochemical processes by which high dose IV vitamin C might have an impact as a cancer treatment, and a study examined the action of ascorbate on cells infected with HIV. A further study examined whether high-dose vitamin C oral supplementation impacted the steady-state concentration of a drug used to treat HIV. We had also seen a small, prospective observational study on the effects on quality of life in cancer patients of IV vitamin C, and two literature reviews which focused on vitamin C and the possible role of oxidative stress in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Because those documents related to the role of substances in the treatment or prevention of medical conditions rather than to health benefits in generally healthy people, they were not relevant to support the claims in the ad. We had also seen four literature reviews and the abstract of a journal article in relation to vitamin C’s role in the functioning of the immune system. We considered the literature reviews together confirmed that research had established that vitamin C was important to the normal functioning of the immune system due to its role in protecting cells against oxidative stress, and noted that one review stated that epidemiological studies had shown that eating fruit and vegetables could help to protect against some diseases, although that could not be directly attributed to vitamin C. However, those documents were not sufficient evidence that vitamin C IV infusions could help normally healthy people protect themselves against illness or that it improved the functioning of the immune system. The abstract did not provide sufficient information for us to assess its relevance. In relation to the role of B vitamins in immune function, we had seen a textbook chapter about vitamin B2 deficiency, two documents which provided information about the roles of various B vitamins in the immune system, including B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12, and an article which provided information about the immune-related functions of vitamin B6. We had seen four review articles relating to vitamin B12 which summarised the causes and health implications of vitamin B12 deficiency and confirmed its importance for the normal functioning of the body, particularly the nervous system and blood cell formation. They also highlighted the need to maintain adequate levels in the body, particularly for vegans and vegetarians who were more likely to have inadequate levels of vitamin B12 in the body as it was primarily found in animal products. We considered the documents demonstrated that adequate intake of the B vitamins included in the Classic Myers’ drip was necessary for the normal functioning of the immune system. However, they were not sufficient evidence that an IV drip containing those vitamins could help normally healthy people protect themselves against illness or that it improved the functioning of the immune system. We had seen an article and three evidence reviews relating to the role of selenium in immune function. We considered they established that adequate levels of selenium were needed for the normal functioning of the immune system and that selenium deficiency could contribute to greater susceptibility to viral infectious diseases, but that its role was complex and interdependent on other substances and high levels in the body did not necessarily correlate to better health. A small study, which was referenced in one of those reviews, suggested that dietary intake of selenium may help improve immune function in people with lower selenium plasma levels. However, the evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate that selenium, when delivered via IV drip, could improve immune function in normally healthy people. We had seen a small RCT which looked at the effects of zinc or zinc and lysine oral supplementation on infection rates in elderly people. It did not appear to find significant effects for either supplement over a placebo, and in any case we considered it was not relevant to claims relating to the effects of IV drips on immune function in the general population. Two studies compared the effects on serum magnesium concentrations of oral and IV infusions of magnesium sulfate when used as a treatment for asthmatics suffering an asthma attack. We considered they were not relevant to the effects of magnesium on immune function in generally healthy people. Two further literature reviews related to the roles of various micronutrients in immune function, including vitamins B6, B12 and C, and zinc, magnesium, and selenium. An article related to the role of various vitamins and minerals in the prevention and treatment of Covid-19, including vitamins B2, B3, B6, B12 and C and the minerals calcium, magnesium, selenium, and zinc. The documents confirmed that those vitamins and minerals played a role in immune function, but they were not sufficient or relevant evidence that an IV drip containing those nutrients could help normally healthy people protect themselves against illness or that it improved the functioning of the immune system. With regard to the claim that the drip provided an increase in energy, while we had seen evidence (referenced above) that the B vitamins in the Classic Myers’ drip were important for the normal functioning of the body, they did not support claims that the drip could increase energy levels in normally healthy people. We had seen three additional documents which specifically related to the effects of vitamin C on energy/fatigue levels. An article examined data from a large-scale observational study (20,000 participants) in the UK to identify risk factors for vitamin C deficiency and found a correlation between low vitamin C levels and self-reported poorer physical health. Risk factors were: being older, male, of lower socioeconomic status and educational attainment, no alcohol intake, being a smoker, and having low levels of physical activity. The authors reported that the findings suggested that vitamin C supplementation was likely to only have an impact on those with the lowest levels of vitamin C, and we considered that many of the risk factors they identified for low vitamin C levels were less likely to be present in the audience for the ad. A study assessed the effects of 6g of oral vitamin C on fatigue in normally healthy office workers over a two-week period, but because it was not controlled or blinded and did not relate to IV administered vitamin C, it was not adequate evidence for advertising claims relating to IV vitamin C. An RCT examined the effects of an IV drip containing 10mg of vitamin C on fatigue and oxidative stress in normally healthy office workers in the Republic of Korea. The RCT was randomised, placebo-controlled, and double-blinded: 73 were in the treatment group and 74 in the control group, who were administered IV saline only. Participants were aged between 20 and 49 years and had no vitamin supplement intake in the two days before enrolment in the study. Each participant was administered one drip. The primary outcome measures were the differences in self-reported fatigue score at two hours and at one day after the intervention, comparing between the groups. Secondary outcome measures were between-group comparisons of oxidative stress levels at two hours and at one day after the intervention, and a between-group comparison of plasma vitamin C concentration at two hours after intervention. The authors reported that fatigue score was significantly decreased in the vitamin C group compared to the placebo group at both two hours and one day after intervention, although this was evident in subjects with a lower vitamin C level at baseline but not for those with a higher level. However, the fatigue score was reported on a zero to ten scale, and the difference between mean score for the groups was, even specifically for those with lower vitamin C levels at baseline, only 0.43 at two hours after intervention and 1.14 one day after intervention. We considered the study did not demonstrate that such differences on a ten-point scale constituted a clinically significant difference. The authors also reported that oxidative stress was lower in the treatment group at two hours compared to the placebo group, but not at one day. They concluded that there was no significant relationship between fatigue and oxidative stress. While the RCT was well-designed, we considered its findings did not constitute adequate evidence that a vitamin C IV drip of any dose improved energy levels or decreased fatigue. The IV Clinic had provided an RCT which examined whether dietary zinc magnesium aspartate (ZMA) supplementation in resistance-trained men, administered during training, had an effect on training adaptations (as well as other outcome measures less relevant to claims to increase energy levels). We understood that ZMA, a food supplement, contained zinc, magnesium aspartate, and vitamin B6. While The IV Clinic’s drip contained zinc, vitamin B6, and magnesium chloride-hexahydrate, we considered that one small RCT relating to the effects of an oral supplement on resistance-trained men, which showed no significant differences in the results of its three outcome measures, was not adequate evidence to support the advertising claim. We had seen five documents which explored links between levels of hydration and energy: a clinical review of febrile illnesses in athletes and a series of four articles describing levels of dehydration in professional football players in Chile, how dehydration was thought to affect performance in training and matches, and strategies for recovery, although we had not seen full copies, in English, of two of those documents. However, the first of those documents related to the use of saline as a treatment for a medical condition, and all of those documents related to high-performance athletes. We considered they were therefore not adequate to support the claim in the ad. We had not seen any documents which related to the individual nutrients included in the Classic Myers’ drip and their effects on mood and mental wellbeing. We concluded we had not seen adequate evidence to support the claims that the Classic Myers’ drip would help to maintain mood and mental wellbeing, provide an increase in energy levels, or improve a person’s immune resistance to infection and disease over any time period. The IV Clinic provided two documents relating to mood with regard to the Calmer drip. The description for that drip featured an icon of a person, with a green head, in the lotus position, and stated, “Calm your mind. Busy hectic lifestyle can often lead to negative thoughts and impact on our overall wellbeing. Calm your mind from the hustle and bustle of life this positive IV which will help you unwind from life’s stresses [sic].” We considered consumers would therefore understand that the drip would help to maintain mood and improve mental wellbeing, in particular by having a calming, relaxing effect. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. We had not been provided any information about the formulation of the Calmer drip. It was therefore not clear whether the Calmer drip contained any of the substances referenced in the evidence provided. Notwithstanding that, one of the documents related to whether taurine affected seizures in mice, and therefore was not relevant as evidence for the advertising claims. The RCT which investigated the role of dopamine in depression induced acute phenylalanine and tyrosine depletion in its treatment group, hypothesising that it would result in a reduction in mood and cognitive function. It therefore related to the effects of those substances in a medical condition rather than the effect on mood of IV drips administered to normally healthy people. As referenced above in relation to the Classic Myers’ drip, a journal article gave an anecdotal account of a doctor’s experience of using the Myers’ Cocktail to treat a man who presented with depression and anxiety. It was anecdotal evidence, relating to the use of IVNT to treat a medical condition. The documents were therefore not relevant to claims that the Calmer drip could maintain mood and improve mental wellbeing. We concluded we had not seen adequate evidence to support the claims that the Calmer drip would help to maintain mood and improve mental wellbeing, in particular by having a calming, relaxing effect, over any time period. The description of the Immuno Boost drip featured an icon of a ‘medical’ cross on a green background, between two hands, and stated, “Immunity Support. Reboot your immune system with this formulae aimed for those who wish to keep their immune system at optimal levels. Aids returning to full health and shakes off sluggishness that comes from feeling off-colour and gives a boost to overall health. A heavy IV loaded with vitamins and amino acids – not ideal for the 1st time user”. We considered consumers would understand that to mean that the drip would provide a ‘boost’ or improvement in the functioning of their immune system, providing greater protection against infection and disease as well as helping them to recover more quickly after an illness. In the context of the references to “returning to full health”, “feeling off-colour” and a “boost to overall health”, we considered consumers were likely to expect those benefits to last a few days to several weeks. We noted The IV Clinic’s comment that if an individual was deficient in vitamins such as vitamin C, D, or A, their immunity might be compromised. However, we considered that because the ads were targeted to a general audience, rather than to those who had been diagnosed as having a specific vitamin deficiency, we expected to see evidence which showed that the drips would have the claimed effects for normally healthy people. Additionally, it was not clear that the drip contained either vitamin A or D. While they had provided evidence relating to vitamin C, it was not in the list of nutrients included in the drip formulation they had provided to us, which comprised: vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12, and the amino acids lysine, cystine, ornithine, and taurine. We reviewed documents The IV Clinic had provided in support of claims about immune function, notwithstanding that it was not clear whether the drip contained all the substances that this evidence related to. We also reviewed other documents we had seen which related to the same substances and immune function, and substances they had stated were included in the drip formulation. We had reviewed evidence relating to the effects of vitamins B2, B3, B6, B12, and C, selenium, zinc, and lysine on immune function in relation to the Classic Myers’ drip. Six of those documents also referenced additional substances. One review article summarised the causes and health implications of vitamin B9 deficiency, two literature reviews related to the role of vitamin B9 in immune function, and the article about the role of various nutrients in the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 included discussion of vitamins B1 and B9. One document provided information about the role of vitamin B1 in the immune system, and a further document provided information about the roles of vitamins B1, B4 and B7 (biotin), and the amino acid carnitine, in the immune system. The documents confirmed that those B vitamins and carnitine played a role in immune function but they were not sufficient or relevant evidence that an IV drip containing those vitamins could help normally healthy people protect themselves against illness or that it improved the functioning of the immune system. We further understood, from an article relating to the levels of zinc and copper needed in total parenteral nutrition (complete replacement of oral food intake), that metabolism of those minerals could be negatively affected by the presence of the amino acids cysteine, cystine, and histidine in the same formulation. The IV Clinic had stated that the Immuno Boost drip contained cystine, and we understood it may also contain zinc. The IV Clinic had also provided a review looking at the importance of vitamin B9 in the immune system of mice and an in vitro study into the relationship between vitamin B7 deficiency and inflammatory responses. We considered that in vitro studies and evidence relating to studies on animals, which did not relate to IV drips, were not adequate to support claims that the advertised IV drips could improve immune function. We concluded that the claims that the Immuno Boost drip would improve immune system function, providing greater protection against infection and disease and quicker recovery after illness, over any time period, had not been substantiated. The description for the Gluta Glow drip stated, “Brighter, Clearer Skin. Aids in Brighter Clearer Appearance of Skin. Full of powerful antioxidants to help reduce pigmentation, leaving your skin looking bright, fresh and glowing. Ideal for those with darker or Asian skin types wanting a brighter overall complexion”. We understood that many consumers interested in IV drips advertised for skin health would be aware that glutathione was purported to have skin lightening properties. In that context, we considered consumers would understand the word “Gluta” in the drip name to refer to glutathione, and the references to “brighter” skin and the reduction of pigmentation to mean that the drip could lighten skin pigmentation. We considered the references to “clearer” and “fresh and glowing” skin would be understood to mean that the drip would also help to improve the general appearance of skin. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those effects may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the effects would therefore likely range from days to weeks. We had seen five documents that related to the effects of glutathione on skin appearance and condition, and/or its skin-lightening effects. The literature review provided by The IV Clinic, which was published in 2016, stated that there were no RCTs which looked at the use of IV glutathione for skin lightening despite its common use for that purpose, and that there were only two RCTs relating to its use for skin lightening via oral supplementation (one of which we had seen in abstract form) and one relating to its topical application (of which we had seen a full copy). We had seen two RCTs published after the literature review. The first RCT, provided by The IV Clinic, related to the antimelanogenic and anti-ageing effects of oral glutathione supplementation, and the second also related to the effects of oral glutathione supplementation. We considered that evidence relating to oral supplementation and topical application of glutathione was not relevant to claims made about the effects of an IV drip. With regard to the effects of vitamin C on improving the general appearance of skin and lightening skin pigmentation, we had not seen any evidence additional to that reviewed in relation to the Anti-Ageing drip. We concluded we had not seen adequate evidence to substantiate the advertising claims that the Gluta Glow drip could have an effect on skin pigmentation or improve the general appearance of skin, over any time period. The description for the Red Carpet drip stated, “Hydration & Energy. The IV to have prior to a night out. Helps to hydrate the skin leaving you looking your best for any major event. This helps to give you the energy to enjoy your event keeping you hydrated through the night”. We considered that consumers would understand from the description that the drip should be administered during the day leading up to an evening event, because it would provide an immediate and noticeable improvement in the appearance of their skin and energy levels, which would last from several hours up to around a day. The IV Clinic had not confirmed the contents of the drip, so it was not clear whether any of the evidence they had provided was relevant to the claims in the ad. We nonetheless reviewed the relevance and adequacy of the evidence on the basis that the drip might contain the substances referenced in the evidence (collagen and proline, water, and vitamins B6, B9, and B12) as well as any additional documentation we had seen of relevance to the advertising claims made for the Red Carpet drip. The RCT provided by the advertiser examined how certain muscles synthesised collagen and protein after exercise, using IV drips containing proline. However, the RCT investigated muscle recovery after exercise, and the proline was used as a measurement method; the study did not measure its effects. We considered it was therefore not relevant to the claims in the ad. One literature review summarised research into the role of B vitamins in brain health, and a second summarised the causes, and health implications, of vitamin B12 deficiency. A further article provided a general overview of research on hydration and health but did not comment on the value of IV drips for any specific health benefit. We therefore considered those documents were not relevant to claims relating to the appearance of skin or energy levels in normally healthy people. We had reviewed documents relating to the effects of B vitamins, vitamin C, amino acids, lipoic acid, magnesium, calcium, and glutathione on skin health/appearance in relation to the Anti-Ageing and Gluta Glow drips. We had reviewed a range of documents relating to the role of the Myers’ Cocktail, saline, B vitamins, vitamin C, and ZMA on energy levels in relation to the Classic Myers’ drip. We had not seen sufficient evidence to support claims to improve the appearance of skin or increase energy levels. Finally, we reviewed a number of documents relating to hydration. A chapter from a medical manual about volume depletion (dehydration) provided an overview of the condition and recommended that IV saline be given to patients with severe dehydration or when oral fluid replacement was impractical. A journal article provided an overview of the conditions hypernatremia and hyponatremia (abnormally high and low sodium levels) and recommended IV infusion as a treatment. Two articles described the conditions lactic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis and recommended IV saline as a treatment. We had also seen the clinical review of febrile illnesses in athletes referenced above in relation to the Classic Myers’ drip. Those documents focused on the use of saline as a treatment for medical conditions and therefore were not relevant to advertising claims aimed at generally healthy people. We had also seen the series of four articles about dehydration in professional football players in Chile, reviewed in relation to the Classic Myers’ drip, which did not relate to hydration via IV drip and in any case related to dehydration in professional athletes rather to the normally healthy general population. Finally, we reviewed a study that examined the impact of food intake on the gastrointestinal absorption and effectiveness of an anti-diuretic medicine. Saline IV drips were used to hydrate the healthy participants in a study design which, for the purpose of accurate measurement, required that participants did not drink anything (or eat anything other than specific meals) during the trial. We considered the study demonstrated the use of saline IV drips as a method of hydration by researchers but noted that IV administration was used rather than oral rehydration in order to make precise measurements relevant to the outcome measures of the study. We considered the evidence demonstrated that maintaining adequate levels of hydration was important to the normal functioning of the body, but that it did not demonstrate that IV drips provided benefits over and above oral fluid intake in maintaining (or restoring) adequate levels of hydration in normally healthy people undertaking normal levels of physical activity, or that heightened levels of hydration were needed to improve energy levels or improve the appearance of skin. We concluded we had not seen adequate evidence to support the advertising claims that the Red Carpet drip would provide a noticeable improvement in the appearance of skin and improve energy levels over any time period. The description for the Diet & Detox drip featured an icon of a torso, with arrows on either side pointing in at the waist, and stated, “Detox/Fat Burning. A blend of nutrients, vitamin and amino acids to help reduce toxins on your body [sic]. Aids the body functions and aids digestion. Ideal for those dieting or trying to lose weight as it helps to burn off stubborn fat”. We considered consumers would understand that the drip would improve the body’s ability to eliminate toxins, aid digestion, and burn fat, resulting in weight loss. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. The description for the Burner drip stated, “Burst of Energy. The ideal IV for those looking to lose weight or for a fast burst of energy”. We considered consumers would understand that the “Burner” drip would help them lose weight, but that there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long that benefit may last; consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefit would therefore likely range from days to weeks. We considered consumers would understand from the ad’s references to a “Burst of Energy” and “fast burst of energy” that the drip would provide an immediate improvement in their energy levels that would likely last from several hours up to around a day. The description for the Body Builder drip featured an icon of a hand weight and stated, “Muscle Builder. Aimed at those who wish to have the ultimate amino acid infusion to aid their muscle building nutrition. It will help in the synthesise[sic] of protein and burning of fat to help improve muscle size and strength. Can be given weekly”. Because the ad referenced that the drip could be given weekly, we considered consumers would understand that a single drip would help them reduce their levels of body fat and build muscle mass and, as a consequence, increase their strength, with the effects lasting for approximately one week. We further considered they would expect that regular weekly administration of the drip would result in sustained reduction of body fat and increased muscle mass. We considered that the drip as described was likely to be of particular interest to consumers who were already engaging in strength and resistance training. The IV Clinic had said the Body Builder drip contained vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, and B12 and the amino acids lysine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, glycine, carnitine, and methionine. They had not confirmed the contents of the other drips but had provided evidence relating to saline, amino acids, and arginine in relation to the Diet & Detox drip, and vitamins B3 and B8 and arginine and leucine in relation to the Burner drip. Given that the ad made similar claims that the Diet & Detox, Burner and Body Builder drips could aid in fat burning and/or weight loss, we reviewed all the evidence provided to support those claims together. The article about the medical management of constipation did not make any reference to IV drips and therefore was not relevant to claims that an IV drip could aid weight loss. The review of research into amino acid supplementation and metabolic health hypothesised that dietary amino acids could affect the gut microbiota and therefore have an impact on metabolic health and weight control. However, it was not clear how that hypothesis extended to amino acids delivered via IV drip. A further literature review looked at the role of the amino acid arginine in the body. It stated that oral administration of arginine was not optimal because 40% of dietary arginine was degraded by the small intestine and suggested that arginine could be a novel therapy in treating obesity and metabolic syndrome. However, it did not cite robust evidence which supported claims that IV arginine would aid weight loss. Two conference papers which summarised evidence relating to the metabolic roles of the amino acid leucine, which was present in dietary protein, and its potential role in aiding weight loss in those on high protein/low carbohydrate reduced-calorie diets were not relevant because they did not relate to leucine as provided by IV drips. One small, non-blinded RCT involving older women looked at the short-term effects on muscle protein synthesis (the process by which protein was produced to repair muscle damage caused by intense exercise) of taking a leucine-enriched essential amino acid supplement immediately after exercise. It concluded that such supplements could help to generally raise muscle protein synthesis and so help to protect against age-related muscle degeneration and frailty. Another small, 12-week RCT which looked at the effects of daily leucine-rich amino acid supplementation combined with moderate training in the elderly found that strength loss caused by muscular fatigue was less pronounced for the treatment group compared with the placebo group at the end of the study period. Neither of the studies reported on the effects of the substances on rates of fat burning or weight loss. A review of evidence relating to niacin (vitamin B3) as a treatment or combination treatment for lipoprotein abnormalities and a meta-analysis of evidence relating to the effect of inositol (vitamin B8) supplementation on lipid profiles in patients with metabolic diseases were not relevant because the evidence related to the use of those substances in the treatment of medical conditions. We had also seen a small study of obese women that investigated which measurements, other than basic BMI measurements, might be indicators for a propensity to develop metabolic disorders. The study suggested that isoleucine may be found in higher concentrations in obese women, but it was not relevant to support claims that IV drips could aid weight loss. We had also seen a trial in which ten people were given 1g of the amino acid l-carnitine as an oral supplement with every meal for ten days, which found that it increased fatty acid oxidation. However, it was of a small size, was not randomised, controlled, or blinded, and did not relate to IV administration and therefore was not adequate to support advertising claims relating to fat burning or weight loss. The IV Clinic did not reference any specific evidence with regard to the claims that the Burner drip could provide an immediate improvement in energy levels. We had reviewed evidence in relation to energy-boosting claims for the Classic Myers’ and Red Carpet drips in relation to various substances. Additionally, we had seen a literature review examining the relationship between oral glutamine supplementation and fatigue in the context of physical exercise. It concluded that glutamine could be seen to improve some fatigue parameters, but that it seemed to have limited effects on physical performance. We concluded it was not adequate to support the claims because it did not relate to IV-administered glutamine. We had also seen an RCT which found that six months of l-carnitine oral supplementation increased capacity for physical (and cognitive) activity by reducing fatigue, compared to placebo, in centenarians. As it related to oral supplementation and involved very elderly participants, we considered it was not relevant to the advertising claim. We considered that the two articles which described the conditions lactic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis (referenced in relation to the Red Carpet drip) and the article about the medical management of constipation (referenced above in relation to claims for weight loss) were somewhat relevant to the claims to eliminate toxins. The latter article, and the review of research into amino acid supplementation and metabolic health (also referenced above in relation to claims for weight loss) were also somewhat relevant to the claims that the Diet & Detox drip could aid digestion. However, for the reasons referenced above, we considered they were also not adequate evidence to support those claims. The IV Clinic had also highlighted the two RCTs on amino acid supplementation in elderly people, and the study of obese women, in support of the claims that the Body Builder drip could build muscle mass and strength. While one of the RCTs reported on the effects of amino acid supplementation on strength, none of the three studies measured the effects of such substances on muscle size or growth. None of the studies related to the effects of amino acids as delivered by a single IV infusion. We concluded we had not seen adequate evidence to support the claims that the Diet & Detox, Burner and Body Builder drips would improve the body’s ability to eliminate toxins, aid digestion, reduce body fat and aid weight loss, build muscle mass resulting in increased strength, or provide an immediate improvement in energy levels, lasting for any time period. The description of the Pre-Fighter drip featured an icon of a flexed arm with bulging biceps, and stated, “Energy Release. Excellent IV to release energy and help provide optimum performance prior to an event”. We considered consumers would understand from the description that the drip should be administered in the hours before a sporting event to provide an immediate increase in energy levels, and that it would help them to perform to their highest ability. In that context, we considered they would expect the benefits to last from several hours up to around a day. The three documents referenced by The IV Clinic (relating to vitamin B9 and to ZMA), and additional documents we had reviewed in support of energy-boosting claims, were not adequate to support such claims as summarised in relation to the Classic Myers’, Red Carpet, and Burner drips. The description for the After Fighter drip featured an icon of a water droplet with a blue ‘medical’ cross on it, and stated, “Muscle Recovery. Specifically formulated for after sports performance to help the body rebuild and eliminate toxins which can occur from lactic acid build up in your muscles. Ideal after a major sporting event and for those after a heavy training session”. We considered consumers would understand that, if administered within several hours after a sporting event or demanding exercise, the drip would provide quicker, more effective recovery for muscles, including by eliminating toxins and lactic acid. That would be noticeable through, for example, experiencing reduced muscle soreness over a shorter time period than they would otherwise have experienced. The IV Clinic had not confirmed what substances were included in the formulation of the After Fighter drip. We reviewed the two documents they had referred to as well as other documentation we had seen which related to the same substances or to similar advertising claims. With regard to the documents referred to by The IV Clinic, the study looked at the effects of a topical gel containing hyaluronic acid and four amino acids on wound healing. We considered it was not relevant to claims relating to the use of IV drips in normally healthy individuals. We had reviewed the RCT which looked at how muscles synthesised collagen and protein after exercise in relation to the Red Carpet drip. It was not relevant because it did not investigate the effects of proline (which we assumed was contained in the After Fighter drip) on muscle recovery after exercise. We had reviewed a range of documents in relation to the Classic Myers’, Red Carpet and Burner drips regarding hydration and energy which also had some relevance to claims about recovery from exercise. However, they were not sufficient to support the claims in the ad because, as referenced above, they related to the use of saline as a treatment for medical conditions and/or did not relate to IV drips. The two articles about the treatment of lactic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis using IV saline, reviewed in relation to the Red Carpet drip, were also relevant to claims about the elimination of toxins from the body and from muscles in particular, but related to the use of saline as a treatment for medical conditions. In relation to the Diet & Detox, Burner and Body Builder drips, we had reviewed two RCTs provided by The IV Clinic in which older people were given leucine-rich amino acid oral supplementation. The first RCT examined its effects on muscle protein synthesis, and the second examined its effects on muscular fatigue, which were of relevance to the advertising claims made about the After Fighter drip. However, the RCTs related to oral supplementation rather than IV infusion, and because the participants were elderly people, they were not relevant to advertising claims about muscle recovery after a sporting event or demanding exercise. We also assessed a review article which looked at the roles of glutathione and n-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) in exercise-induced oxidative stress. However, with regard to glutathione, the evidence related to glutathione produced by the body; it noted that oral supplementation was an ineffective way of providing glutathione and that there was no relevant evidence relating to its administration by IV. The reviewed studies relating to the role of NAC were largely conducted using IV administration, but the article did not contain sufficient information for us to evaluate their methodological robustness or relevance to the claims made in relation to the After Fighter drip. We concluded we had not seen sufficient evidence to support the claims that the After Fighter drip would provide quicker, more effective recovery for muscles after a sporting event or demanding exercise. Because we had not seen evidence that was adequate to support the advertised health benefits of the IV drips, or the substances in them when delivered via IV infusion, we concluded that the claims were misleading and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told GMG Pharmacy Ltd t/a The IV Clinic not to make any claims, explicit or implied, that their IV drips or the substances in them could provide any health benefits, over any period of time, until such time as they held evidence relating to the use of IV drips in normally healthy humans that was adequate to support such claims. This included, for example, claims that the drips or substances in them could: improve immune function; improve skin, hair and nail health; maintain mood or improve mental wellbeing; improve recovery from exercise; aid weight loss, fat burning, digestion or the body’s ability to eliminate toxins; boost energy levels; and change skin pigmentation.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/gmg-pharmacy-ltd-a19-549495-gmg-pharmacy-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Get A Drip Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on advertising claims about the health benefits of intravenous nutritional therapy (IVNT), identified for investigation following complaints received and intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 20 December 2023.","The Get A Drip website www.getadrip.co.uk, seen 7 February 2019, listed the intravenous (IV) drip services it offered on a page headed “Our Menu”: “Bolt-Ons”; “Basic Hydration”; “MultiVit Drip”; “Energy Drip”; “Immunity Drip”; Detox Drip”; “High Dose Vitamin C Drips”; “The Beauty Drip”; “Fitness Drip”; “The Anti-Ageing Drip”; “Hair Enhancement Drip”; “Slim Drip”; “Limitless Drip”; and “Skin Brightening Drips”. The names of the drips linked to individual pages which included claims about the benefits of each of the IV drips.",The complainant challenged whether the claimed health benefits of the IV drips were misleading and could be substantiated.,"Get A Drip Ltd said the IV drips they used were manufactured by the company IntraVita. They had attended training provided by IntraVita and they provided a copy of IntraVita’s training manual. They also provided an article with general information about intravenous nutritional therapy (IVNT), published in Aesthetics Journal in May 2016, and copies of four advertorials by IntraVita, published in the same journal.Following an internal review, they had changed the names of the “Hair Enhancement Drip” and “Skin Brightening Drip” to “Hair Health Drip” and “Skin Health Drip” and had removed the “Beauty Drip” and “Slim Drip” from their service offering. They had also added information to their website about the doses of the ingredients in each of the drips they continued to offer. They said the body needed a constant resource of essential nutrients but it had never been more difficult to obtain all the nutrients needed from diet alone. Studies had shown that modern intensive agricultural methods had stripped increasing amounts of nutrients from the soil, and in attempts to grow climate adaptable, pest resistant crops which were bigger and grew more rapidly, nutrient uptake could not keep pace. Additionally, some dietary practices meant people could be susceptible to low nutrient levels; vegans were known to be at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency and vegetarian diets could cause vitamin B12 depletion. There were also numerous conditions and circumstances in which additional nutrients were required above and beyond the recommended daily allowance, such as poor digestion, nutrient malabsorption, food sensitivities, chronic inflammation, stress, exercise, alcohol consumption or the ageing process. When cells were not healthy or not functioning to their maximum capacity they were not as effective in transporting vitamins and minerals to where they were needed. That was because many cells required energy, obtained from those nutrients, in order to transport nutrients. Supplementation had therefore become more important. Oral supplementation could provide a regular source of nutrients, but consumers using oral supplementation did not always supplement at the correct schedule or dose, and it could also be expensive. Get A Drip emphasised IVNT was not to be used as an alternative to a healthy balanced diet. Instead, they aimed to provide an alternative, more efficient and cost-effective way for people to supplement and enhance the delivery of micronutrients to the body for health and wellbeing. They provided information about the specific biological processes relating to bioavailability of nutrients when administered intravenously and orally. There were multifarious barriers that could substantially impact the effectiveness of orally administered nutrients, such as molecular weight, lipophilicity, and the presence of ‘transporters’. They explained that, unlike oral supplementation, IV administration of nutrients bypassed the gastrointestinal tract’s sometimes inefficient absorption mechanisms and gastrointestinal absorption saturation and increased renal clearance, resulting in higher and more predictable serum concentrations that were not obtainable with oral or even intramuscular administration. That was important not only to allow cells to rapidly repair, regain strength and function normally again, but also because various nutrients only exerted their pharmacological effects depending on the concentration of the nutrient. The considerations of steady-state drug concentration (the time during which the concentration of a drug in the body remained consistent), and the time it took to reach steady-state, were crucial. IV administration provided a more precise approach in achieving desired plasma concentrations. As an example, they referred to a study which related to the antiviral effects of vitamin C at a serum concentration level that was achievable if administered via IV drip, but not via oral supplementation. They said that plasma concentrations of vitamin C were little affected by oral administration, due to poor bioavailability. They also said that some nutrients would be present in the system for a long time when administered via non-oral means, and therefore could be administered less regularly than oral supplementation. For example, when administered via intramuscular injection, vitamins D and B12 could last in the system for up to three months. They provided a study in which 40 apparently healthy adults who were identified as having vitamin D deficiency were administered vitamin D either orally or via intramuscular injection. Get A Drip believed that, because IVNT administered nutrients directly into the body via intravenous infusion, any claims about the health benefits or effects of those nutrients would fall within the scope of health claims as defined by the CAP Code, which was “any claim that states, suggests or implies that a relationship exists between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health”. They said that meant that any advertising claims that suggested or implied that nutrients included in IVNT could have health-related benefits must comply with the CAP Code’s rules regarding health claims. They ensured that claims about the health benefits of the substances in their IV drips were in line with the regulatory requirements for claims about the health benefits of those substances in foods and supplements (which included that the health claim must be authorised on a list following assessment of relevant evidence by the Food Standards Agency or, previously, the European Food Standards Agency). They said the health benefits of a nutrient would be the same irrespective of the route of administration and as such believed that evidence relating to the health benefits of nutrients, when administered via oral supplementation, would be relevant to support advertising claims about the health benefits of IV drips. The nutrient would be used by the body in the same way, but IV administration resulted in a higher concentration of the nutrient in a person’s blood plasma, with a high degree of specificity and control compared to oral administration. They therefore believed that nutrients delivered via IV administration could be as effective, if not more so, than those delivered by oral administration. They provided three studies in support: one in which vitamin C was administered to healthy individuals and two in which magnesium was administered to asthmatics suffering from mild or severe asthma attacks. They provided two expert reports. The first was from the Director of Research and Development at a compounding pharmacy which provided a range of pharmaceuticals, including components for IV drips such as vitamins, minerals and amino acids. The expert referenced the complexity and relative inefficiency of oral administration of nutrients compared to IV administration. This included highlighting that vitamins could vary as to their level of solubility and permeability, which affected their bioavailability, meaning that better bioavailability could be attained through IV administration. The second expert report was from Get A Drip’s nutritional therapist. They said that randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the health effects of IVNT versus no intervention/placebo (or comparing the health effects of IVNT with oral supplementation to support claims of IVNT’s superiority to oral supplementation) would be preferable to support advertising claims. However, if no such studies were available, they considered it would be acceptable to substantiate the claims through a combination of established science and studies involving the same nutrient(s) from oral supplementation versus placebo, as well as studies that identified and proved the body’s need for and method of utilisation of those nutrient(s), from which blood levels needed for normal function had been identified as the key factor. They also provided more detail on bioavailability, including highlighting various complicating factors for bioavailability when administering a nutrient orally compared to via IV. However, the medium within which the nutrient was delivered via IVNT would need to be assessed, since it might not release the nutrients to tissues immediately, despite 100% being delivered to the circulation. It should also be investigated as to whether one high dose of a nutrient via IV every two to four weeks would have the same effects as a low dose orally every day. Get A Drip said the ASA should not limit its acceptance of evidence only to evidence relating to the health benefits of nutrients in normally healthy people. They said under that definition “normally healthy” people would not include those with inadequate vitamin status, because they would not be in a complete physical state of wellbeing. They said that ‘normally healthy’ people could still become unwell or rundown, and there were a number of reasons why someone who may be considered to be healthy would still have poor vitamin status, for example low dietary intake and malabsorption. They said many studies often contained positive and negative controls to determine statistical significance, so results would still often apply to individuals who were ‘normally healthy’. They said the results of studies on ‘healthy’ people would be applicable to ‘healthy’ and ‘non-healthy’ people, but because in scientific study it was logical to use those more in need of vitamins in order to identify a positive correlation, many studies related to ‘non-healthy’ people. Get A Drip’s second expert additionally argued that evidence relating to people with medical conditions should be considered relevant to claims about the health benefits of IVNT. A nutrient’s mode of action and purpose in states of dysfunction and disease were guides as to how those mechanisms might go wrong with inadequate levels of the nutrient, as well as how the nutrient corrected or prevented the problem being studied if levels were replenished or exceeded. They said evidence would be particularly relevant if the nutrient was delivered via IVNT in the study. Turning to the specific health benefits referenced in their advertising, Get A Drip provided information about the roles of various vitamins and minerals in cellular energy production and energy-yielding metabolism; in particular the B vitamins (except folate), vitamin C, iron and magnesium. They said adequate supply of B vitamins was required for the appropriate functioning of the energy-production system, and a shortfall of any one of them would be rate-limiting for energy production, with potentially severe metabolic and health consequences. Similarly, vitamin C and magnesium played an important role in the production of energy.In support of their advertising claims linking vitamin C to improvements in fatigue and energy levels, they said that symptoms of moderate vitamin C deficiency included fatigue, irritability and muscle pain. They provided a clinical trial on healthy people which evaluated the efficacy of IV vitamin C compared to placebo drip, a study in which oral supplementation was administered to healthy people for two weeks, and a longitudinal study of 15,000 healthy people. In relation to the advertising claims relating to immune function and antioxidant action, they said it was well-established that nutritional deficiency could impair the immune system. They referred to a literature review and article, which described that the body may be deprived of essential nutrients when fighting infection due to the additional needs of the immune system. Nutrient status could be affected by stressful lifestyles, diabetes, or obesity. They said nutritional supplementation, delivered in high doses, might be beneficial in potentially reducing viral load and hospitalisation for Covid-19 patients. They said that vitamins C and E acted as powerful antioxidants in combatting free radicals. Vitamin B1 had been reported to have potential anti-inflammatory and suppression of oxidative stress effects. Referring to a source that they did not provide, they stated that Vitamin B1 deficiency affected the immune system through increased inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic disturbances, which further led to the production of aberrant antibodies. They provided a literature review which described that vitamin B6 influenced innate/adaptive immunity, function and proliferation of immune cells, and that the intake and supplementation of vitamin B6 improved some immune functions in humans with a B6 deficiency. They provided a review article, and two studies relating to oral glutathione supplements, to support advertising claims that glutathione also had an important role in the maintenance of numerous immune functions, as well as other critical functions such as detoxifying drugs and protecting from oxidative damage. They noted that unlike oral administration, IV administered glutathione had 100% bioavailability. They referred to review articles and a study to support their advertising claims that selenium had a range of effects, but particularly that it was essential to the function of the immune system and played a major role in the regulation of redox and antioxidant functions and helped protect against DNA damage. They said low selenium levels were linked to raised risk of mortality and poor immune function, with supplementation increasing immune function and antiviral influences. They also referred to a RCT which examined the effects of oral l-carnitine supplementation in centenarians, in support of claims that this substance supported the immune system, reduced stress and increased vitality. Supported by a literature review examining the relationship between glutamine supplementation and fatigue in the context of physical exercise, they said glutamine was an essential amino acid widely used in sports nutrition, especially because of its immunomodulatory role. It also played several other biological functions, such as cell proliferation, energy production, glycogenesis, ammonia buffering and maintenance of the acid-based balance. Supplementation, especially when administered for more than five consecutive days, seemed to increase muscle glycogen synthesis and reduce ammonia accumulation induced by exercise, although more research was needed to establish greater effect of glutamine in comparison to supplements containing carbohydrate or creatine monohydrate. They said glutamine supplementation seemed to attenuate markers of muscle damage. In support of claims relating to fat burning, they referred to a small study in which the rate of fatty acid oxidation was measured in healthy subjects who took oral l-carnitine supplements. They also provided a study which examined the effects of l-carnitine and l-acetylcarnitine on male infertility to support claims that l-carnitine boosted male fertility. In support of their advertising claims linking folic acid with cognitive function, they provided a study that compared serum levels of folate and cognitive function in participants who had received oral supplementation with those who received a placebo over a three-year period. Another large study found that high plasma folate levels were associated with improved cognitive performance. In relation to claims about improved sleep, they said magnesium supplementation appeared to improve subjective and objective measures of insomnia in elderly people in an RCT. For advertising claims relating to skin health and anti-ageing, they referenced two studies that showed that daily oral glutathione supplementation had various beneficial effects on skin properties and demonstrated properties as an anti-ageing agent. In relation to the High Dose Vitamin C drip, they highlighted that the ad stated “Vitamin C […] contributes to collagen formation”, which they said was an authorised health claim for foods. They believed the advertising claim would be understood by consumers to mean only that IV vitamin C would contribute to collagen formation, rather than that it would increase collagen formation. They said vitamin C had a role in the synthesis of collagen in connective tissues, referring to a study on the use of vitamin C in the treatment of cancer, which described that vitamin C acted as an electron-donor, keeping iron in the ferrous state and thereby maintaining the full activity of collagen hydroxylases. With regard to claims about hydration, they did not recommend a hydration drip over drinking water and in their experience, customers did not interpret their ads in that way. Their basic Hydration drip was designed to have an additional “Bolt-On” so individuals could tailor the drip to their needs following a consultation with a medical professional; this was also provided to clients who might be unwell but not so unwell that they would require NHS treatment. They said IV drips still provided basic hydration. That was demonstrated by numerous studies, including one they provided, which was conducted on healthy men who were underwent a daily intravenous hydration regimen following the effects of a diuretic.","Upheld The ad described 16 IV drips offered by Get A Drip, including a range of claims about the health benefits provided by each drip. In the descriptions of the drips, the ad also included some claims about the role that some of the specific substances in the drips played in the body, and the health benefits they provided. The ASA considered that consumers would therefore understand that the health benefits associated with those specific substances would be provided by the described drip. Claims about the health benefits of intravenously-administered nutrients must comply with CAP Code rules relating to misleading advertising and to health-related (non-food) products. Rules relating to health claims made about foods (i.e. products and their constituents that were ingested), referenced by Get A Drip, applied only to foods, and therefore were not relevant. We considered that the average consumer who viewed the web pages relating to the advertiser’s IV drips, and to whom the claims were clearly addressed, would be generally healthy but interested in products which might support or enhance specific aspects of their health and wellbeing, or support their preparation for or recovery from specific events, including intensive exercise. We considered those consumers would have some understanding that the body required certain levels of vitamins, minerals and other substances to support its normal functioning. The homepage of the website referenced that at an appointment, “after a quick assessment with one of our healthcare professionals we can help you select the IV Drip […] that is right for you”, followed by a scrolling list featuring the drips and icons, such as “Energy Drip” and “Detox Drip”. IV drips were delivered via an invasive method which we considered consumers would generally associate with medical uses, and single drips were offered by IV clinics in the UK at prices generally ranging from around £100 to around £400; at the time the ads were viewed, the price of most of Get A Drip’s drips ranged between £75 to £250 for a single drip, with the Limitless Drip priced between £450 and £850. The Skin Brightening drip was priced at £3,000 for their recommended 14-week course of weekly drips. In that context, and the context referenced above, we considered consumers were likely to expect that an IV drip was an instantaneous, and therefore more effective, or superior way, of delivering essential nutrients to normally healthy people than other methods (such as through diet or regular oral supplementation) and therefore would also provide superior health benefits more quickly than the same nutrients administered through such other methods. We considered consumers would understand that the nutrients delivered via a single IV drip would result in a one-off increase in the availability of those nutrients to be utilised by the body, whereas diet and oral supplementation provided a daily regular, ongoing source of those nutrients. However, consumers would be unlikely to have knowledge of how long the various nutrients, administered via a single IV drip, would be available for utilisation by the body or how long the claimed health benefit might therefore last. As a result they were likely to base their understanding of how long the health benefit might last on information in the ad, where relevant information was included. This could include, for example, references to a ‘course’ of drips or recommended frequency of administration, the overall impression created by the claims, the name of the drip or other elements of the ad. We understood that human nutritional needs were complex, requiring different amounts of different nutrients at differing frequencies to ensure normal functioning of the body, and these needs varied from person to person depending on a range of factors such as biological sex, age, levels of physical activity and so on. Human nutritional needs were answered through diet and, in the case of vitamin D, exposure to the sun. We took expert advice on the advertiser’s arguments about the superior bioavailability provided by IV drips compared to oral administration of substances, and on what type and standard of evidence would be relevant to claims about the health benefits of IVNT drips. The expert agreed with Get A Drip and its experts that IV administration would achieve peak plasma concentrations of a substance more quickly than oral administration (although the speed at which this was achieved would vary between nutrients). This was not, however, the same as bioavailability. While IV administration achieved 100% bioavailability under the pharmacological definition (the fraction of the administered drug that reached the systemic circulation), there was a lack of consensus as to the definition of bioavailability in relation to nutrients. Consequently, the ASA’s expert considered there was not sufficient evidence to support assertions that IVNT offered superior bioavailability compared to oral administration for all nutrients. Regarding the type and standard of evidence that would be relevant, the expert firstly referenced evidence for advertising claims about the health benefits of IVNT drips which did not include that IVNT would provide superior health benefits compared to diet or oral supplementation. For such claims, they advised that evidence relating to the health benefits of oral supplementation could be relevant to support claims relating to IVNT. Such evidence would, however, have to provide robust evidence of the correlation between a particular dose of a nutrient (i.e. the quantity provided, frequency of provision, and duration of provision) and a particular health benefit. The IVNT drip would have to be of the same or greater dose than the oral supplement. The advertiser would have to demonstrate that the particular formulation of the drip did not include other nutrients or components which could adversely affect the effectiveness of the key nutrient (e.g. amino acids that bound to zinc or copper). They would also have to demonstrate that interaction with the gut microbiome was not necessary to achieve the health benefit, which may be the case for some nutrients such as polyphenols and glucosinolates. The expert secondly referenced evidence for advertising claims that IVNT would provide superior health benefits compared to other methods of administration of the same nutrients such as through diet or oral supplementation. For such claims they advised that evidence would need to relate to the immediate and superior efficacy of the specific drips the advertiser sold, or substances contained in them. Such evidence would ideally consist of appropriately designed RCTs comparing the health benefit effects of IVNT with a placebo drip and with oral supplementation with the same formulation and at the same dose. Alternatively, such evidence could consist of appropriately designed observational studies comparing reported or measured health end-points of users of IVNT with individuals who routinely took the same nutrients in a different form, at similar doses. Those studies would also have to be adequately controlled in terms of inclusion criteria and other likely mitigating variables. Such evidence should have clinically significant outcomes that were directly relevant to the health benefits claimed in the advertising. Evidence relating to the health benefits of regular oral supplementation would not be sufficient, but evidence relating to intramuscular injection could be, as its mode of delivery was similar to IV drip. The expert further advised that evidence relating to the effects of nutrients on individuals suffering from a deficiency of that nutrient would not be relevant to claims about the health benefits of IVNT in normally healthy individuals, regardless of the method by which the nutrient was administered. Evidence relating to the effects of nutrients on individuals suffering from a medical condition that was not a nutrient deficiency could be adequate to support claims about the health effects of IVNT, whichever method of administration was used. However, such evidence would have to show that the provision of the nutrient led to improvements in a measure that was not related to the medical condition or to symptoms caused by side effects of any ongoing medical treatment. The expert understood that such evidence was likely to be scant. The ASA understood that IV administration delivered 100% of a nutrient to the systemic circulation and achieved peak plasma concentrations more swiftly than via oral supplementation. However, we understood that the speed at which peak plasma concentration would be achieved varied between nutrients, and that a range of other factors, including the composition of the particular IV drip formulation, could affect the body’s use of those nutrients and the delivery of any health benefits. We considered the type and standard of evidence we would expect to see, taking into account the context of how consumers would interpret the advertising claims as outlined above: that IVNT would provide a superior way of delivering essential nutrients to normally healthy people than other methods and therefore would also provide superior health benefits more quickly than the same nutrients administered through such other methods. We therefore expected to see evidence which related to the immediate and superior efficacy of the specific drips sold by the advertiser, or drips with the same formulation and dosage as referenced in the ad (including regularity of administration), preferably in humans who were normally healthy. Evidence relating to people with a clinical nutrient deficiency or which examined the effects of a nutrient as a treatment for a medical condition would not be relevant to advertising claims directed at generally healthy consumers. Evidence relating to people with a medical condition would only be relevant if it clearly established that the measures by which health benefits were assessed were unrelated to either the medical condition or to symptoms caused by associated medical treatments. We expected all evidence, whether consisting of RCTs or observational studies, to be methodologically robust with clinically significant outcomes that were directly relevant to the health benefits claimed in the advertising. Get A Drip provided a number of documents to support the range of health claims made for their drips. The article and four advertorials published in Aesthetics Journal provided general information about IVNT and its uses, the evolution of the IVNT sector in the UK, information about the sector membership body - the Association of Intravenous Micronutrient Supplementation (AIMS) - and guidance on advertising IVNT from AIMS. Those documents did not constitute adequate evidence to support claims about the health benefits of the drips. The IntraVitra training manual included references to evidence which related to the health benefits of substances included in their drips. However, a section of the manual titled “Efficacy” stated, “Evidence of intravenous nutrient therapy (IVNT) efficacy is based mainly on anecdotal clinical experience with limited clinical trial publications on combination intravenous micronutrient therapy in peer review [sic] journals”. It then briefly summarised evidence which related to the use of IVNT in treating the medical conditions fibromyalgia, asthma and cardio-vascular disease, and of oral supplementation in aiding wound healing. As referenced above, we considered that evidence which related to use of a nutrient as a treatment for a medical condition, including by oral supplementation, was not relevant to the claims in Get A Drip’s advertising, which related to the efficacy of IVNT in normally healthy individuals. We further considered that anecdotal accounts of clinical experience were not adequate to support claims that IVNT had immediate and discernible health benefits for normally healthy individuals. We reviewed whether the remaining documents they had provided, alongside other documents we had seen, supported the claims made in Get A Drip’s advertising. Basic Hydration dripThe ad stated “This is our basic IV drip hydration package, designed for pure and simple rehydration. As we know, everyone is different, so you can add any of our Bolt-On options to this depending on your needs”. It featured an icon of a water droplet. Given the context referenced above, we considered consumers would understand from the ad that hydrating via the Basic Hydration drip provided benefits over and above those provided through oral fluid intake (i.e. drinking water or electrolyte drinks) in ensuring adequate hydration in generally healthy people. We considered consumers were likely to expect that these benefits would include achieving greater and more effective levels of hydration, more quickly, than could be achieved through oral fluid intake. We reviewed documents which related to the claims as consumers would understand them and which related to the substances in the drip, which were sodium chloride (saline solution), bicarbonate, potassium and calcium. A chapter from a medical manual about volume depletion provided an overview of that condition and recommended that IV saline be given to patients with severe dehydration or when oral fluid replacement was impractical. A journal article provided an overview of the conditions hypernatremia and hyponatremia (abnormally high and low sodium levels) and recommended IV infusion as a treatment. Two articles described the conditions lactic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis and recommended IV saline as a treatment. A clinical review of febrile illnesses in athletes highlighted that fever could affect physical performance, was correlated with dehydration, and that participating in strenuous exercise with a fever could exacerbate dehydration. Those documents focused on the use of saline as a treatment for medical conditions and therefore were not relevant to advertising claims aimed at generally healthy people experiencing normal levels of water and sodium loss. Get A Drip provided a study that examined the impact of food intake on the gastrointestinal absorption and effectiveness of an anti-diuretic medicine. Saline IV drips were used to hydrate the healthy participants in a study design which, for the purpose of accurate measurement, required that participants did not drink anything (or eat anything other than specific meals) during the trial. We considered the study demonstrated the use of saline IV drips as a method of hydration by researchers but noted that IV administration was used rather than oral rehydration in order to make precise measurements relevant to the outcome measures of the study. A series of four articles described levels of dehydration in professional football players in Chile, how dehydration was thought to affect performance in training and matches, and strategies for recovery, although we had not seen full copies, in English, of two of those documents. A further article provided a general overview of research on hydration and health. The articles did not relate to hydration via IV drip and did not comment on whether there was greater value in IV drips over drinking water or electrolyte drinks for ensuring adequate hydration, including in the context of strenuous physical exercise or busy lifestyles. We considered the evidence demonstrated that maintaining adequate levels of hydration was important to the normal functioning of the body, and that saline IV drips were used as an effective method of rehydration. However, we considered that it did not demonstrate that IVNT provided benefits over and above oral fluid intake in maintaining (or restoring) adequate levels of hydration in generally healthy people, and the advertising claim was therefore misleading. Immunity drip The ad featured an icon showing a shield with a cross inside it and stated “Feeling under the weather and need a boost? The Immunity Drip is packed with nutrients and antioxidants including a high dose of Vitamin C to help boost the immune system to help speed up recovery”. We considered consumers would understand from the name of the drip, the description and the icon, that it would provide a ‘boost’ or improvement in the functioning of their immune system, including through improving the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress, resulting in greater protection against infection and disease as well as helping them recover more quickly after illness. In the context of the references to a “boost” when a person was “under the weather” and “speed[ing] up recovery” we considered consumers were likely to expect those benefits to last a few days to a short number of weeks. We reviewed documents which related to the claims as consumers would understand them and which related to the substances in the drip, which as stated in the ad were: saline, bicarbonate, vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and C, potassium and calcium.In relation to vitamin C, Get A Drip had provided a literature review that described the chemical and biochemical processes by which high dose IV vitamin C might have an impact as a cancer treatment, and a study that examined the action of ascorbate on cells infected with HIV. We had also seen a small, prospective observational study on the effects on quality of life in cancer patients of IV vitamin C, and two literature reviews which focused on vitamin C and the possible role of oxidative stress in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Those documents examined the role of vitamin C in the treatment or prevention of medical conditions rather than to health benefits in generally healthy people and so were not relevant to support the claims in the ad. A further cross-over study, involving seven participants, examined the effect of high-dose vitamin C oral supplementation on the steady-state concentration of a drug which was used to treat HIV. It concluded that such supplementation could reduce the effectiveness of the drug by impacting its steady-state concentration. We considered the study did not demonstrate any health effects of vitamin C and therefore was not relevant to support claims in the ad. We had also seen five literature reviews (including one provided by Get A Drip) and the abstract of a journal article in relation to vitamin C’s role in the functioning of the immune system. We considered the literature reviews together confirmed that research had established that vitamin C was important to the normal functioning of the immune system due to its role in protecting cells against oxidative stress, and noted that one review stated that epidemiological studies had shown that eating fruit and vegetables could help to protect against some diseases although that could not be directly attributed to vitamin C. However, those documents were not sufficient evidence that vitamin C IV infusions could help normally healthy people protect themselves against illness or that it improved the functioning of the immune system. The abstract did not provide sufficient information for us to assess its relevance. In relation to other nutrients in the Immunity drip, Get A Drip provided a textbook chapter about vitamin B2 deficiency, an article which provided general information about the functions of various B vitamins in the immune system, two articles which provided information about the immune-related functions of vitamin B6 (one of which also related to vitamin B12 which was not included in the Immunity drip), and referred to a further document about the role of vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5 (which was not included in the Immunity Drip) and B6 in the immune system. We considered the documents demonstrated that adequate intake of the B vitamins included in the Immunity drip were necessary for the normal functioning of the immune system. However, they were not sufficient evidence that an IV drip containing those vitamins could help normally healthy people protect themselves against illness or that it improved the functioning of the immune system. Get A Drip had also provided a literature review relating to the role of various micronutrients, including vitamins B6 and C (which were in the Immunity Drip), in immune function and an article relating to the role of various vitamins and minerals, including vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and C, and the minerals potassium and calcium (which were in the Immunity Drip), in the prevention and treatment of Covid-19. The documents confirmed that those vitamins and minerals played a role in immune function, but they were not sufficient or relevant evidence that an IV drip containing those nutrients could help normally healthy people protect themselves against illness or that it improved the functioning of the immune system. We concluded we had not seen adequate evidence to demonstrate that the Immunity drip could improve immune function or provide greater protection against and quicker recovery after illness, over any time period, and the claims were therefore misleading. Energy drip The ad stated “Also known as the Myers’ Cocktail, the Energy Drip will help to give a natural energy boost and help regulate sleep patterns to get you feeling back on top form. To boost immune system and energy levels”. It featured an icon of a lightening bolt surrounded by two circular arrows. We considered consumers would understand from the ad that the Energy drip would provide an increase in energy levels, improvement in immune function and help to regulate sleep. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long these benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. We reviewed documents which related to the claims as consumers would understand them and which related to the Myers’ Cocktail (an IV infusion developed by a US physician) or to substances in the drip, which as stated in the ad were: saline, bicarbonate, vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, B12 and C, potassium, calcium and glucose. We had reviewed documents relating to the role of vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and C and the minerals potassium and calcium in immune function in relation to the Immunity drip and concluded they were also not sufficient to support the claim that the Energy drip could improve immune function. The literature review and article provided by Get A Drip which related to the role of various nutrients in immune function, referenced above, also referred to vitamin B12, which was additionally in the Energy Drip. As above, while we considered the documents confirmed that vitamin B12 played a role in immune function, they were not sufficient or relevant evidence that an IV drip containing vitamin B12 could help normally healthy people protect themselves against illness or that it improved the functioning of the immune system. We had seen four review articles (two of which were provided by Get A Drip) relating to vitamin B12 which summarised the causes and health implications of vitamin B12 deficiency and confirmed its importance for the normal functioning of the body, particularly the nervous system and blood cell formation. They also highlighted the need to maintain adequate levels in the body, particularly for vegans and vegetarians who were more likely to have inadequate levels of vitamin B12 in the body as it was primarily found in animal products. A further article provided by Get A Drip gave information about the immune-related functions of vitamins B12 (and B6; referenced above). However, the articles did not provide evidence which supported claims of increases in energy levels, improvement of immune function or sleep regulation, with regard to IV drips containing vitamin B12, in normally healthy people. Get A Drip had provided three additional documents relating to the effects of vitamin C on energy/fatigue levels. An article examined data from a large-scale observational study (20,000 participants) in the UK to identify risk factors for vitamin C deficiency and found a correlation between low vitamin C levels and self-reported poorer physical health. Risk factors were: being older, male, of lower socioeconomic status and educational attainment, no alcohol intake, being a smoker, and having low levels of physical activity. The authors reported that the findings suggested that vitamin C supplementation was likely to only have an impact on those with the lowest levels of vitamin C and we considered that many of the risk factors they identified for low vitamin C levels were less likely to be present in the audience for the ad. A study assessed the effects of 6g of oral vitamin C on fatigue in normally healthy office workers over two weeks, but because it was not controlled or blinded and did not relate to IV administered vitamin C it was not adequate evidence for advertising claims relating to IV vitamin C. Finally, an RCT examined the effects of an IV drip containing 10mg of vitamin C on fatigue and oxidative stress in normally healthy office workers in the Republic of Korea. The RCT was randomised, placebo-controlled and double-blinded: 73 were in the treatment group and 74 in the control group, who were administered IV saline only. Participants were aged between 20 and 49 years and had had no vitamin supplement intake in the two days before enrolment in the study. Each participant was administered one drip. The primary outcome measures were the differences in self-reported fatigue score at two hours and at one day after the intervention, comparing between the groups. Secondary outcome measures were between-group comparisons of oxidative stress levels at two hours and at one day after the intervention, and a between-group comparison of plasma vitamin C concentration at two hours after intervention. The authors reported that fatigue score was significantly decreased in the vitamin C group compared to the placebo group at both two hours and one day after intervention, although this was evident in subjects with a lower vitamin C level at baseline, but not for those with a higher level. However, the fatigue score was reported on a zero to ten scale and the difference between the mean score for the groups was, even specifically for those with lower vitamin C levels at baseline, only 0.43 at two hours after intervention and 1.14 one day after intervention. We considered the study did not demonstrate that such differences on a ten-point scale constituted a clinically significant difference. The authors also reported that oxidative stress was lower in the treatment group at two hours compared to the placebo group, but not at one day. They concluded that there was no significant relationship between fatigue and oxidative stress. While the RCT was well-designed, we considered its findings did not constitute adequate evidence that a vitamin C IV drip of any dose improved energy levels or decreased fatigue. A journal article relating to the Myers’ Cocktail included a reference to the IV infusion providing an “energy boost” for an athlete, but this was in the context of the drip being administered as treatment for a flu-like illness. In any case the article provided only anecdotal accounts of a doctor’s experience of using the Myers’ Cocktail and as such was not adequate evidence to support advertising claims. We had also seen an RCT which examined the safety, feasibility and efficacy of the Myers’ Cocktail in treating fibromyalgia. Neither document was relevant to claims that the Energy drip could increase energy levels, improve immune function or regulate sleep in normally healthy people. Some of the documentation we had reviewed in relation to the Hydration drip explored links between levels of hydration and energy: the clinical review of febrile illnesses in athletes and the series of four articles describing levels of dehydration in professional football players in Chile. The first of those documents, however, related to the use of saline as a treatment for a medical condition, and all of those documents related to high performance athletes. We considered they were therefore not adequate to support the claims in the ad. We concluded we had not seen adequate evidence to demonstrate that the Energy drip could increase energy levels, improve immune function and help to regulate sleep, over any time period, and those claims were therefore misleading. Limitless drip The ad stated “You’ve seen the film, now it’s your turn to feel limitless. A powerful drip containing high strength doses of antioxidants, amino acids and nutrients to boost the immune system, increase energy levels […] boost metabolism, support fertility levels and contribute to healthy hair, skin and nails.” It featured an icon of an infinity symbol and stated that there were two options for the drip. We considered consumers would understand from the claims that both versions of the Limitless drip would provide a ‘boost’ or improvement in the functioning of their immune system including through improving the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress, increase energy levels, speed up their metabolism, help to keep their hair, skin and nails healthy, and help to maintain optimal fertility. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. The ad stated that option 2 of the drip contained: bicarbonate, vitamins B12 and D, the minerals potassium, magnesium, zinc and calcium, the amino acids l-lysine, l-proline, l-arginine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, alanine, histidine, serine, glycine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tyrosine and glutamine, and glutathione and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Option 1 was the same but included the additional substances: vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5 and B6, the mineral selenium, the amino acid taurine, and l-carnitine. We reviewed documents which related to the claims as consumers would understand them and which related to the substances in the two versions of the Limitless drip. With regard to immune function, we referred back to documents we had already reviewed in relation to the Immunity and Energy drips, which for the reasons stated above we considered were not adequate evidence for the claim as it related to the substances contained in those drips. Three of those documents also provided information about the immune-related functions of other substances that were contained in the Limitless drips: vitamin D, selenium, magnesium and zinc. However, they were not adequate to support the advertising claim that the Limitless drip improved the functioning of the immune system. In addition we had seen a small RCT which looked at the effects of zinc or zinc and lysine oral supplementation on infection rates in elderly people. It did not appear to find significant effects for either supplement over placebo, and in any case we considered it was not relevant to claims relating to immune function in the general population. We further understood, from an article relating to the levels of zinc and copper needed in total parenteral nutrition (complete replacement of oral food intake) that metabolism of those minerals could be negatively affected by the presence of the amino acids cysteine, cystine and histidine in the same formulation; we noted histidine was present, along with zinc, in the Limitless drips.We had also seen an article and three evidence reviews (two of which were provided by Get A Drip), relating to the role of selenium in immune function. We considered they established that adequate levels of selenium were needed for the normal functioning of the immune system and that selenium deficiency could contribute to greater susceptibility to viral infectious diseases. Its role, however, was complex and interdependent on other substances, and high levels of selenium in the body did not necessarily correlate to better health. A small study, which was provided by Get A Drip and referenced in one of those reviews, suggested that dietary intake of selenium may help improve immune function in people with lower selenium plasma levels. However, the evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate that selenium, when delivered via IV drip, could improve immune function in normally healthy people. Get a Drip had provided the study which compared vitamin D levels in those with vitamin D deficiency who received the same total dose of vitamin D either divided into five weekly oral doses or in a single intramuscular injection. We noted that when vitamin D levels were measured six weeks after baseline, both methods of administration had resulted in a significant increase, with no significant difference in levels between the groups. While at week 12 the levels in the oral group had started to decline and those in the intramuscular injection group had continued to rise, neither the decline nor the rise was significant compared to their respective levels at week six. We considered the study therefore demonstrated that, in people with a deficiency, daily oral supplementation of vitamin D for five weeks was as effective as one intramuscular injection at increasing levels at six weeks, with those levels sustained at 12 weeks. The authors posited that the intramuscular route caused a slow and sustained release because the preparation was deposited at the injection site; it was not clear though that this would also apply to IV administration. The study did not investigate any health benefits that might be derived from increasing vitamin D levels in normally healthy people. Seven papers related to glutathione, three of which were provided by Get A Drip. A review article which looked at the role of glutathione on exercise-induced oxidative stress described the role of glutathione in combating oxidative stress in the body, but the evidence it described related primarily to glutathione produced by the body. The article noted that oral supplementation was an ineffective way of providing glutathione and that there was no relevant evidence relating to its administration by IV drip. An article provided by Get A Drip gave an overview of the antioxidative protective roles, measurement and biosynthesis of glutathione. It noted some of its therapeutic uses, but did not provide evidence relating to the effects of IV-administered glutathione. A further article summarised the role of glutathione in the body, and stated that glutathione deficiency contributed to oxidative stress, which played a key role in ageing and the pathogenesis of many diseases. It stated that new knowledge of nutritional regulation of glutathione metabolism was critical for the development of effective strategies to improve health and treat such diseases. We considered it established the importance of glutathione in the normal functioning of the body, including that it had a role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. It noted that the rate at which glutathione was produced and used by the body meant that in healthy adults, glutathione was used less than two days after it was produced. The article, however, did not provide information about the usefulness of direct glutathione supplementation (either orally or by IV infusion) or whether, if increased levels were delivered by such methods, it would have any additional benefits to health, such as improving immune function. Get A Drip provided two subsequent studies. A one-month trial in which 12 participants aged between 50 and 80 years old were given oral glutathione measured whether it increased levels of glutathione in the body and its effects on oxidative stress and immune function markers. The other study made in vitro assessments of the stability and bioavailability of different formulations of oral glutathione supplements, with an assessment of the glutathione levels achieved in rats following oral administration of those supplements. Those studies were not relevant to the health effects of IV-administered glutathione. An abstract stated that glutathione played a crucial role in the detoxification of xenobiotics, but provided no further detail; this was not adequate evidence to support advertising claims. Another document related to the use of glutathione in treating ovarian cancer and therefore was not relevant to claims about improving immune function in normally healthy people. We considered the evidence therefore also did not support the advertising claims that the two versions of the Limitless drip improved immune function, including through improving the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress. With regard to the claim to increase energy levels, Get A Drip had provided a literature review examining the relationship between oral glutamine supplementation and fatigue in the context of physical exercise. It concluded that glutamine could be seen to improve some fatigue parameters but that it seemed to have limited effects on physical performance. We concluded it was not sufficiently relevant to the advertising claim, which related to a general increase in energy levels rather being specific to the context of physical exercise, and to IV-administered glutamine. Get A Drip also provided an RCT which found that l-carnitine oral supplementation taken for six months increased the capacity in centenarians for physical and cognitive activity by reducing fatigue, compared to taking a placebo. As it related to oral supplementation and involved very elderly participants, we considered it was not relevant to the advertising claims. We otherwise had not seen any additional relevant evidence to that already referred to above in relation to the Energy drip. We concluded the claim to increase energy levels therefore also was not supported in relation to the Limitless drips. We had seen a range of evidence relating to the effects of amino acids and vitamin B3 on metabolism. A review of research into amino acid supplementation and metabolic health hypothesised that dietary amino acids could affect the gut microbiota and therefore have an impact on metabolic health and weight control. However, it was not clear how that hypothesis extended to amino acids delivered via IV drip. A further literature review looked at the role of the amino acid arginine in the body. It stated that oral administration of arginine was not optimal because 40% of dietary arginine was degraded by the small intestine, and suggested that arginine could be a novel therapy in treating obesity and metabolic syndrome. However, it did not cite robust evidence which supported claims that IV arginine would have the health benefits stated in the ad. We had also seen a small study of obese women that investigated which measurements, other than basic BMI measurements, might be indicators for a propensity to develop metabolic disorders. The study suggested that isoleucine may be found in higher concentrations in obese women, but it also was not relevant to support claims that IV drips had the health benefits stated in the ad. Two conference papers which summarised evidence relating to the metabolic roles of the amino acid leucine, which was present in dietary protein, and its potential role in aiding weight loss in those on high protein/low carbohydrate reduced-calorie diets were also not relevant because they did not relate to leucine as provided by IV drips. A trial provided by Get A Drip in which ten people were given 1g of oral l-carnitine with every meal for ten days found that it increased fatty acid oxidation. However, the trial was of a small size, was not randomised, controlled or blinded and did not relate to IV administration. Finally, a review of evidence relating to niacin (vitamin B3) was not relevant because it examined its role as a treatment or combination treatment for lipoprotein abnormalities. We therefore had not seen adequate evidence to support the advertising claim that the Limitless drips could speed up metabolism. While Get A Drip had not provided any evidence relating to the effects of CoQ10, we noted an article about the content and stability of CoQ10 in oral supplements found that it was quite unstable and liable to break down, meaning that its presence in an IV drip could be affected by the overall formulation. In relation to other claims, we had not seen any evidence about the effects of the substances in the drip with regard to the health of hair, skin and nails. Get A Drip provided an RCT which examined the effects of l-carnitine and l-acetylcarnitine (which was not in the Limitless drips) on the fertility of men with low sperm concentration and motility. It was not relevant to the advertising claim about fertility because it related to the use of those substances as a treatment for a medical condition. We concluded we had not seen adequate evidence to substantiate the advertising claims that the Limitless Drips could improve the functioning of the immune system including through improving the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress, increase energy levels, speed up the metabolism, help to keep hair, skin and nails healthy, or help to maintain optimal fertility, over any time period. Slim drip The ad stated “Help to boost your metabolism, increase energy and help to support your natural weight loss. L-Carnitine helps to transfer fat to the mitochondria”, and featured an icon of a flame. We considered consumers would understand those claims to mean that the Slim drip would help them to lose weight, speed up their metabolism and increase their energy levels. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. We reviewed documents which related to the claims as consumers would understand them and which related to the substances in the drip, which as stated in the ad were: bicarbonate, vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5 and B6, potassium, calcium and magnesium, the amino acids l-lysine, l-proline, l-arginine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, alanine, histidine, serine, glycine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and tyrosine, and l-carnitine. With regard to the claims to aid weight loss and speed up metabolism, we had not seen any relevant evidence additional to that which we had reviewed in relation to the claim that the Limitless drips could speed up metabolism. With regard to the claim to increase energy, we had reviewed evidence relating to some of the same substances (and the Myers’ Cocktail) in relation to the Energy and Limitless drips. An additional RCT examined whether dietary zinc magnesium aspartate (ZMA) supplementation in resistance-trained men, which was administered during training, had an effect on training adaptations (as well as other outcome measures less relevant to claims to increase energy levels). While we understood that ZMA contained magnesium, vitamin B3 and zinc, and the latter substance was not included in the Slim drip, we nonetheless reviewed its relevance. However, the RCT involved only a small number of participants, showed no significant differences in the results of the outcome measures and related to a dietary supplement. We concluded it was therefore not adequate evidence to support the advertising claims for the drip. We concluded we had not seen adequate evidence to substantiate the advertising claims that the Slim drip could aid weight loss, speed up metabolism or increase energy levels, over any time period, and the claims were therefore misleading. Fitness drip The ad stated “The Fitness Drip contributes to healthy muscles, helps to increase endurance and energy levels, as well as helping to boost the metabolism. This drip is for you if you’re training or have specific fitness goals that you want to achieve”. It featured an icon of a person on a cross-trainer. We considered consumers would understand the claims to mean that the Fitness drip would have the effects of helping to keep muscles healthy, increase endurance and energy levels and speed up metabolism, particularly in those seeking to improve their fitness levels and ability to engage in strenuous physical activity. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. We reviewed documents that related to the claims as consumers would understand them and which related to the substances in the drip; these were listed as: saline, bicarbonate, vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and C, potassium, calcium, glutamine and l-carnitine. With regard to the claim to speed up the metabolism, we had seen two documents relating to substances in the Fitness drip. The review of evidence relating to niacin (vitamin B3) and the trial provided by Get A Drip in which oral l-carnitine was given to ten participants, both assessed in relation to the Limitless drip, were not adequate evidence. We had not seen any relevant evidence in relation to the claim that the Fitness drip would help to keep muscles healthy. With regard to the claims to increase endurance and energy levels, we referred back to a range of documents we had reviewed in relation to the Basic Hydration, Energy and Limitless drips. However, for the same reasons noted above, none of those documents comprised adequate evidence to support advertising claims that the Fitness drip could increase endurance or energy levels. We concluded that we had not seen adequate evidence to demonstrate that the Fitness drip could help to keep muscles healthy, increase endurance or energy levels or speed up metabolism, over any time period, and that those claims were therefore misleading. Detox drip The ad stated “The Detox Drip contains high doses of antioxidants and essential nutrients to boost the immune system, and help to detoxify the body, leaving you looking and feeling healthier”. It featured an icon of a water droplet surrounded by two circular arrows. We considered consumers would understand those claims to mean that the drip would provide an improvement in the functioning of their immune system and in the body’s ability to remove toxins, including through improving the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress, and that this would result in general improvements in overall health and a healthier appearance. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. We reviewed documents that related to the claims as consumers would understand them and which related to the substances in the drip; these were listed as: saline, bicarbonate, vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and C, potassium, calcium and glutathione. We had reviewed several documents relevant to the effects of vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and C and the minerals potassium and calcium on immune function, including through its effects on oxidative stress, in relation to the Immunity drip, and similarly to the documents relevant to the effects of glutathione on immune function and oxidative stress in relation to the Limitless drip. The two articles describing the conditions lactic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis, which recommended IV saline as a treatment, reviewed in relation to the Basic Hydration drip, were relevant to claims to remove toxins from the body, but related to saline’s use as a treatment for medical conditions. A further article about the medical management of constipation did not make any reference to IV drips and therefore was not relevant to the detox claims in the ad. Other than the journal article containing anecdotal accounts of a doctor’s experience using the Myers’ Cocktail, we had not seen any additional documentation relevant to general improvements in overall health. With regard to appearance, we had seen a review of literature surrounding the role of vitamin C in skin health, which summarised that there was some evidence that general good nutrition led to better skin condition. However, the review compared the efficacy of oral supplementation to that of topical application and did not refer to any research into the effects of vitamin C delivered by IV drip on appearance. We concluded that we had not seen adequate evidence to substantiate the advertising claims that the Detox drip would improve immune system function and the body’s ability to remove toxins, including through improving the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress, resulting in general improvements in overall health and a healthier appearance, over any time period. Anti-Ageing drip The ad stated “A potent combination of essential nutrients and powerful antioxidants combine to help prevent premature ageing, increase energy and boost the immune system” and featured an icon with the word “AGE” surrounded by a circular arrow. We considered that in context consumers would understand those claims to mean that the drip would have a general anti-ageing effect on younger people, including through combatting oxidative stress, and that it would also provide an increase in energy levels and improvement in the functioning of the immune system. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. We reviewed documents which related to the claims as consumers would understand them and which related to the substances in the drip; these were listed as: bicarbonate, the vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5 and B6, the minerals calcium, potassium and magnesium, the amino acids l-lysine, l-arginine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, alanine, histidine, serine, glycine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and tyrosine, and glutathione. With regard to the claim that the drip would have a general anti-ageing effect on the body, including through combatting oxidative stress, we had seen: one literature review relating to amino acid metabolism in the elderly; a medical journal article and RCT relating to the role of magnesium in the body and particularly in the elderly; a literature review and study relating to the role of calcium in ageing; a literature review relating to the role of B vitamins in cognition and ageing; an RCT provided by Get A Drip on the antimelanogenic effect of oral glutathione supplementation; and the articles reviewed in relation to the Limitless drip which summarised the role of glutathione in the body, including one that stated that glutathione deficiency contributed to oxidative stress, which played a key role in ageing. None of that evidence related to the efficacy of the substances as delivered by IV drip in preventing ageing. Instead, much of it concerned the ways in which older people’s bodies processed and used nutrients rather than how those substances could prevent ageing in younger people. The evidence therefore did not support claims that the Anti-Ageing drip could have a general anti-ageing effect on younger people. With regard to the claims that the Anti-Ageing drip could increase energy levels and improve immune function, we had not seen any relevant evidence additional to that reviewed in relation to the same claims made about the Immunity, Energy, Limitless and Slim drips. We concluded that we had not seen adequate evidence to substantiate the advertising claims that the Anti-Ageing drip would have a general anti-ageing effect on younger people, including through combatting oxidative stress, or that it would increase energy levels or improve the functioning of the immune system, over any period of time. Beauty drip The ad stated “Help to prevent premature ageing and improve the health of your hair, skin and nails with The Beauty Drip”. It featured an icon of a lotus leaf. We considered that in context, consumers would understand the claims to mean that the Beauty drip would have an anti-ageing effect on younger people’s appearance and that it would improve the overall health of hair, skin and nails, which might include effects such as preventing wrinkles, and strengthening hair and nails. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. We reviewed documents which related to the claims as consumers would understand them and which related to the substances in the drip; these were listed as: saline, bicarbonate, vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and C, potassium, calcium, glucose and glutathione. We had reviewed documents relating to the effects of calcium, B vitamins and glutathione on ageing in regards to the general anti-ageing claim made for the Anti-Ageing drip. Those documents also did not provide adequate evidence in relation to the more specific claim made about anti-ageing and appearance made for the Beauty drip or for the claim to improve hair, skin and nail health. The review of literature surrounding the roles of vitamin C in skin health, reviewed in relation to the Detox drip, was relevant to the claims, but as referenced above it did not refer to any research into the effects of vitamin C delivered by IV drip. We had not seen any other relevant evidence. We concluded that we had not seen adequate evidence to demonstrate that the Beauty drip would have an anti-ageing effect on younger people’s appearance or that it would improve the overall health of hair, skin or nails, over any time period. Skin Brightening drip The ad stated “Help to brighten and even out skin tone to give a flawless look from your first drip! (Results vary by individual. Weekly course is recommended for 14 weeks (3 stages of drips) then monthly maintenance of either Detox or Beauty Drips to keep up the effects.)”, and featured an icon of a light bulb. The three ‘stages’ of drips were priced separately: Stage 1, comprising four drips, was £850; Stage 2, comprising eight drips, was £1,700; and Stage 3, comprising two drips, was £650. Alternatively, all three stages could be purchased together for £3,000. Because the ad recommended a weekly drip, we considered consumers would understand the claims to mean that a single drip would have the effect of generally improving the appearance of skin and evening out areas of different pigmentation for approximately one week. Additionally, we considered they would understand that a full three-stage course of the Skin Brightening drip would build and enhance those effects over 14 weeks, and that subsequent regular monthly administration of either the Detox or Beauty drips would permanently maintain those effects. We understood that many consumers who were interested in IV drips advertised for skin health would be aware that glutathione, which was listed in the drip contents, was purported to have skin lightening properties, and in that context would interpret the references to “brighter” skin and “evened out” skin tone to mean that a full course of the drip could gradually lighten skin pigmentation over the 14 weeks, and that subsequent regular monthly administration of either the Detox or Beauty drips would permanently maintain those effects. We reviewed documents which related to the claims as consumers would understand them and which related to the substances in the drip. The ad stated that the drip contained the Basic Hydration drip (which comprised sodium chloride (saline solution), bicarbonate, potassium and calcium), plus vitamin C and glutathione. We had reviewed evidence relevant to the effects on the appearance of skin of calcium and vitamin C in relation to the Anti-Ageing and Detox drips. With regard to the advertising claims being understood as claims to even out or lighten pigmentation, we had seen a literature review which stated that there were no RCTs that looked at the use of IV glutathione for skin lightening despite its common use for that purpose, and that there were only two RCTs relating to its use for skin lightening via oral supplementation (one of which we had seen in abstract form) and one relating to its topical application (of which we had seen a full copy). Get A Drip provided two RCTs published after the literature review. The first RCT, which we had reviewed in relation to the Anti-Ageing drip, related to the antimelanogenic effect of oral glutathione supplementation. The second also related to the effects of oral glutathione supplementation. We considered that evidence relating to oral supplementation and topical application of glutathione was not relevant to claims made about the effects of an IV drip. We concluded that we had not seen adequate evidence to substantiate the ways in which consumers would interpret the claims made in relation to the Skin Brightening drip - that it would generally improve skin appearance and that it could have an effect on skin pigmentation, over any period of time. Hair Enhancement drip The ad stated “The Hair Enhancement Drip contains a unique combination of nutrients to promote strong and healthy hair and help to prevent hair loss”. It featured an icon of a comb and scissors. We considered consumers would understand those claims to mean that the drip would generally improve the health of hair, including strengthening it and reducing the amount of hair loss a person was experiencing. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. The ad listed the ingredients of the drip as: bicarbonate, vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B12, the minerals potassium, magnesium, calcium and zinc, the amino acids l-lysine, l-proline, l-arginine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, alanine, histidine, serine, glycine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and tyrosine. We had not seen any evidence which concerned hair health or reduction of hair loss, over any time period, in relation to the substances in the Hair Enhancement drip. We therefore concluded that the claims in the ad had not been substantiated. High Dose Vitamin C drip The ad stated “Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant that helps to boost the immune system, contributes to collagen formation, and helps to prevent premature ageing. Our high strength drip contains large doses for maximum health benefits”. It featured an icon of an orange. We considered consumers would understand those claims to mean that the drip, in particular due to its vitamin C content, would provide an improvement in the functioning of the immune system, and have a general anti-ageing effect on younger people, including through improving the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress. The ad referred to three different ‘strengths’ of the drip: 6.25g, 12.5g and 25g. We considered consumers were likely to understand that the higher the vitamin C content, the more superior and/or longer-lasting the health benefit. However, there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. Get A Drip believed consumers would understand the claim “Vitamin C […] contributes to collagen formation” to mean only that it would contribute to collagen formation, and that similar claims were allowed to be made about the vitamin C content of foods and supplements. However, we considered that in the context of an ad for an IV drip, consumers would interpret the claim as relating to immediate and superior efficacy, and therefore as meaning that the drip would stimulate increased collagen formation. We reviewed documents which related to the claims as consumers would understand them and which related to the substances in the drip: saline, bicarbonate, vitamin C, calcium, potassium and glucose. We had not seen any evidence relating to the effects of any of the substances on ageing or stimulating increased collagen formation. We had seen evidence about the antioxidant or immune functions of vitamin C, calcium and potassium which we had assessed in relation to the Immunity drip and found they were not adequate to support such advertising claims. We concluded we had not seen adequate evidence to support the advertising claims that the High Dose Vitamin C drip could improve the functioning of the immune system, help with collagen formation or have a general anti-ageing effect on younger people, including through improving the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress, over any time period. MultiVit drip The ad stated “Help to boost your immune system and energy levels with the MultiVit Drip. A great all-rounder drip containing essential nutrients for optimal health” and featured an icon of three pills. We considered consumers would understand those claims to mean that the MultiVit drip would provide an improvement in the functioning of the immune system and increase in energy levels, as well as improving overall health. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. The ad listed the ingredients of the drip as: bicarbonate, sodium chloride, vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6 and C, potassium and calcium. We had previously reviewed all the relevant evidence we had seen with regard to the effects those substances had in relation to immune function and energy levels when considering the same claims made about the Immunity and Energy drips. As referenced above, we considered the evidence was not adequate to support such advertising claims. With regard to the improvement of overall health, the report of anecdotal evidence relating to the use of the Myers’ Cocktail was not adequate to support health claims in advertising. We had reviewed evidence relating to the role of calcium in ageing, and the role of B vitamins in the body generally as well as more specifically in cognition and ageing and in brain health. While we considered the evidence showed that B vitamins and calcium were important in the functioning of the body, we had not seen evidence that when delivered by IV drip they improved overall health in normally healthy people. Similarly the evidence relating to the role of vitamin C, including its role in the normal functioning of the immune system, did not substantiate that delivering vitamin C via IV drip would improve overall health. We concluded we had not seen adequate evidence to substantiate that the MultiVit drip, or its individual constituent ingredients delivered via IV drip, improved overall health in normally healthy people, improved the functioning of the immune system or increased energy levels, over any time period. Because we had not seen evidence that was adequate to support the advertised health benefits of the IV drips, or the substances in them when delivered by IV infusion, we concluded that the claims were misleading and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products) and 12.23 (Hair and Scalp).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Get A Drip Ltd not to make any claims, explicit or implied, that their IV drips or the substances in them could provide health benefits, over any period of time, until such time as they held evidence relating to the use of IV drips in normally healthy humans that was adequate to support such claims. This included, for example, stated and implied claims that the drips or the substances in them could: improve overall health; increase energy levels, keep muscles healthy and increase endurance; provide better hydration than other methods in generally healthy people; improve the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress and to remove toxins; improve the functioning of the immune system; improve the appearance and health of skin, hair and nails; reduce hair loss; change skin pigmentation; stimulate increased levels of collagen formation; have an anti-ageing effect; help to speed up metabolism and lose weight; and help to regulate sleep.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/get-a-drip-ltd-a19-549582-get-a-drip-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Howe Tools Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Two radio ads for Howe Tools, a power tool supplier, heard in October on Greatest Hits Radio and Heart Radio: a. In the first radio ad, a voice-over said, “At Howe Tools, we swear by our reliability, which is why we sell quality power tools from only the best brands. And if you don’t believe us you can go [bleep] and [bleep] yourself… Right who’s pressing the bleep button?” A second voice-over then said, “Sorry! Bleep machine is broken.” The original voice-over then responded, “I said, you can go order one today, and enjoy next day delivery at no extra cost. Test us yourself, you won’t [bleep] regret it. Reliability, we swear by it.” b. In the second radio ad, a voice-over said, “At Howe Tools, we swear by our reliability. Which is why we sell quality power tools from only the best brands and if you don’t believe us you can go [bleep] and [bleep] yourself… Right, who’s pressing the bleep button?” A second voice-over said, “Sorry!” The original voice-over then said, “I said you can go order one today and enjoy next day delivery at no extra cost. Test us yourself! Did you get that?”, to which the second voice-over replied, “Yep!”. The first voice-over said, “[bleep] idiot. Reliability? We swear by it”.","Two complainants, who believed that the bleeps alluded to expletives, challenged whether the ad: 1. was offensive; and 2. was unsuitable for children to hear.","1. & 2. Howe Tools said that, because Radiocentre had cleared the script, they understood that it was suitable for broadcast. They asserted that the words “fuck” and “fucking idiot” were not alluded to in the ads. They explained that, when the ads were recorded, the voice actors said the sound “beep” for the first two bleeps heard in the ads, and the word “bloody” for the third bleep, before the bleep sounds were added in post-production. To demonstrate that point, they supplied two audio graphs of the recordings, which showed that no sound was uttered alongside the first or second bleep. As such, they believed that those expletives could not be heard in either ad. They also highlighted that the word “bloody” was classified as a mild swear word according to Ofcom research. They said that the campaign was due to end shortly. Radiocentre said that, at the time of clearance, they believed that specific expletives could not be identified in the ad. They also referred to a CAP Advice article which only featured examples containing partially obscured expletives. Radio Experts, the production agency, explained the intention of the ads was to emphasise that Howe Tools were a reliable company that could be trusted. They believed that they had taken great care to ensure that the delivery was not aggressive or forceful in tone. They re-iterated that the expletive “fuck” was not recorded and therefore cannot be heard during the ads. Instead, they believed that the “ck” sound heard was the “click” at the end of the bleep sound. They also highlighted that they had created two ads, led by both male and female voices to ensure that neither gender was perceived negatively. Bauer confirmed that the ads were heard on Greatest Hits Radio in East Anglia. They explained that Greatest Hits plays classic hits from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and was therefore targeted at older audiences. They highlighted that the average age of a Greatest Hits Radio listener in East Anglia was 51 years, and that 98% of the audience were over 18 according to RAJAR data. They recognised that some listeners may have found the wordplay distasteful but believed that the ad was unlikely to cause widespread or serious offence with a mature audience. They referred to a previous ASA ruling concerning a TV ad which was not considered to have caused serious or widespread offence. It featured a well-known phrase and replaced the expletive with a word rhyming with that expletive. With that ruling in mind, they considered a bleeped out expletive which listeners were not able to hear was less likely to cause offence than a word which sounded very similar to an expletive. Global confirmed that the ads ran across different Heart Radio channels. They stated that the ads had been cleared by Radiocentre with no restrictions, and as such, believed that the ads were suitable for broadcast.","1. & 2. Upheld The BCAP Code stated that ads must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. The ads used “bleeps” to obscure certain words and phrases throughout in contexts where it appeared the person speaking might swear. We recognised that Howe Tools may have intended to refer to different expletives. However, we considered that listeners would interpret the bleeps as “fuck” or its derivatives, given the context of the ad and the way in which the bleeps were heard. For example, we considered that the sentence “you can go [bleep] yourself” heard in the ads would be understood as an allusion to the phrase “you can go fuck yourself”. We accepted that the word “fuck” had not been said by the voice actors when recording, though we considered that they had said the word “bleep” instead, and that would have been intended to be heard as an expletive. We also noted that in ad (b), the last two letters of the expletive “fuck” appeared to be audible in the second bleep, which, although we acknowledged was likely as a result of the bleep being added in post-production, we nevertheless considered further contributed to that impression. Within the narrative of the ads, it later transpired that the person speaking had supposedly not referred to expletives. However, we considered that the “intended” sentence was much longer than the bleep allowed for, and therefore, it was unlikely that listeners would believe that had been said instead of the expletive. We assessed the tone and meaning of the expletives which were alluded to in the ads. We considered that “fuck” was a word so likely to offend that it should not generally be used or alluded to in advertising. We further considered that phrases such as “fuck yourself” and “fucking idiot” would likely be considered aggressive in nature, even if listeners understood that the ads were intended to be humorous. For those reasons we concluded that the allusion to expletives in ads with a general adult audience was likely to cause serious offence, and therefore, that the ads were also unsuitable to be heard by children. The ads breached BCAP Code rules 1.2 (Responsible Advertising) and 4.2 (Harm and Offence).",The ad must not appear in the form complained of. We told Howe Tools to avoid alluding to expletives which were likely to cause serious offence.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/howe-tools-ltd-g23-1215545-howe-tools-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Kellogg Europe Trading Ltd t/a Kellogg Company,,"The product packaging for Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut Clusters, seen on 17 July 2023, featured a promotion. Text on the back of the packaging stated “FREE ADULT TICKET” next to a triangle symbol. Below, text stated “ADULT TICKET OR CHILD TICKET = FREE ADULT TICKET”. Text underneath stated “[triangle symbol] When you buy a full ‘on the day’ priced child or adult ticket.” Text to the right stated “Pre-booking is essential […] Book your ticket in advance online! It’s simple”. Text underneath stated “Find the unique 10 digit code printed inside this pack and go to www.merlinfun.com to select the attraction and secure the date you want to visit”. Further text stated “Book, Pay, Print/Download your entry tickets. Then head straight into the attraction on your day of visit”.","The complainant, who understood that tickets had to be booked in advance in order to redeem the offer, challenged whether the claim “free adult ticket” was misleading because it was based on the price of “on the day” tickets.","Kellogg Europe Trading Ltd t/a Kellogg’s said the partnership between Kellogg’s and Merlin had been in place for 13 years and would be continuing for the foreseeable future. They highlighted that the wording of the promotion had changed over the years. They said the promotion allowed consumers who purchased a full price “on the day” adult or child ticket to receive another full price “on the day” adult ticket and was available throughout the year for attractions in the UK and Ireland. They stated that the front of the promotion stated “FREE ADULT TICKET” which linked to terms and conditions at the bottom of the front packaging. They also highlighted the condition to purchase a full price “on the day” ticket was further repeated on the back and side of the packaging. The full terms and conditions and information about how to claim tickets was displayed on the back of the packaging. They said that whilst pre-booking was essential, tickets could be purchased for the same day or any future date that tickets were available. Kellogg’s believed consumers would understand that if they purchased a full price “on the day” ticket, then they would receive another one for free and it would be understood in a similar way to ‘buy one get one free’ promotions. They also said that, as a result of the complaint, they had reviewed the promotional mechanic and confirmed that the promotion would no longer link to the “on the day” ticket price. Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd t/a Merlin stated that the back of the promotion made clear that consumers could receive a free adult ticket when they purchased a full price “on the day” adult or child ticket, and that was prominently displayed on the back as well as on the side and front of the packaging. Merlin said the “on the day” price was displayed next to the online advanced ticket price across all attraction websites. They stated the “on the day” ticket was fixed for each attraction, for example the cost of an ""on the day"" Alton Towers ticket was £68. However, the advance ticket price was dynamic, and its cost varied throughout the year depending on the date selected and the level of ticket sales. They stated that the term “on the day” was used to indicate that the ticket was full price, and that consumers who bought tickets with the promotional code could book a ticket for either the same day or a date in advance, as long as there was availability. They said consumers would understand “free adult ticket when you buy a full “on the day” priced child or adult ticket” to mean that when they bought a full priced ticket then they would receive a second ticket without paying for it. They also stated consumers would be aware that other ticket options were likely to be available at a cheaper rate, but that the promotion would provide consumers with better value in most cases. Merlin provided sales data for all of their 28 attractions. Apart from Thorpe Park and Alton Towers, consumers who participated in the promotion and bought a full price “on the day” ticket would always make a saving. They explained that, for Thorpe Park and Alton Towers, tickets purchased via the promotion were only the same price as an advanced price ticket in September 2023. However, that represented a very small percentage of the total tickets bought via the promotion. They said that in light of that, they had taken immediate steps to raise their Super Off Peak ticket prices for Thorpe Park and Alton Towers, which would ensure a saving for consumers who at used the Kellogg’s promotion.","Upheld The ad stated “FREE ADULT TICKET” and underneath stated “When you buy a full “on the day” priced child or adult ticket”. The ASA noted that the ad did not refer to “advance tickets” and considered that in the absence of qualifying information, consumers would not understand that there were different ticket categories. We further considered that consumers would not understand the distinction in price or meaning between “on the day” and “advance” tickets because the ad stated that, in order to take advantage of the promotion, participants had to purchase their ticket in advance, regardless of whether they were using it for entry on the same day or for a date in the future. As such, consumers would assume there was one ticket category, and that notwithstanding the method of booking, they would receive a free adult ticket at no extra cost if they purchased an adult or child ticket. We understood that an “on the day” ticket to Alton Towers and Thorpe Park cost £68, which represented a full price ticket, and that consumers who wished to visit the attractions with the promotion would have to pay that full price to qualify for a free adult ticket. We also understood that tickets were cheaper if booked in advance and those “advance” tickets ranged from £34 to £39 for an adult ticket, depending on a range of factors. Because “on the day” tickets bought as part of the promotion had to be purchased in advance on the Merlin website, we compared the cost of purchasing tickets via the promotion with the cost of purchasing two standard “advance” tickets on the website. We understood that for tickets purchased through the promotion, participants paid a total of £68 for an “on the day” ticket and then received another adult “on the day” ticket for no extra cost. We noted that, depending on the particular day, the cost of purchasing two “advance” tickets could vary between £68 and £78. We therefore considered that the maximum saving achieved via the promotion was £10, and that in some cases, purchasing two “advance” tickets equated to the same cost as the promotional tickets, and that there was no saving to be made for consumers. As such, we considered that promotional saving did not align with consumers’ interpretation of a free ticket as advertised. We acknowledged Merlin’s argument that the “on the day” ticket available as part of the promotion offered more flexibility, since consumers could use the promotion to purchase either a ticket for the same day, which “advance” tickets did not offer, or for a date in advance. However, we considered that most consumers would not be using the promotion to purchase a ticket for the same day, and we further noted that both the Alton Towers and Thorpe Park websites advised that tickets should be bought in advance. In any case, because participants were not offered the equivalent promotional savings of a free ticket, we concluded that the on-pack promotion was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 3.17 (Prices).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Kellogg Europe Trading Ltd t/a Kellogg’s and Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd to not misleadingly imply that consumers could get a free adult ticket if that was not the case.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/kellogg-europe-trading-ltd-a23-1206282-kellogg-europe-trading-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Kia UK Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on electric vehicle mileage ranges, identified for investigation following complaints received. See also related rulings published on 20 December.","A paid-for Google ad and a website for Kia, seen on 13 March 2023: a. The paid-for Google ad stated “The all-new Kia Niro – Niro EV up to 285 mile range”. b. The website www.kia.com, featured a page titled “The all-new Kia Niro” which included information about Kia’s Niro range of electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid electric cars. A section comparing the features of the three models included text about the electric model that stated “…Range of 285 miles*”. The asterisk linked to small text further down the page that stated “Available with EV powertrain only”.","The complainant, who had not been able to achieve the maximum range stated in the ads, challenged whether the claims “up to 285 mile range” in ad (a), and “Range of 285 miles” in ad (b) were misleading.","Kia UK Ltd t/a Kia said the ads stated the Niro EV was capable of covering 285 miles on a single charge (from 100% charge to 0%). The term “up to 285 miles” was used in ad (a) to allow for varying driving styles and external environment scenarios which could positively or negatively affect the total driving range. Kia consulted with the external organisation IDIADA Automotive Technology which completed the driving range testing for the vehicle in line with the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). The testing produced two range figures. The first was the ‘City’ range figure which specified the maximum mileage when the car was used for concentrated inner city driving. The second was the ‘Combined’ range figure which specified the maximum mileage when the car was used in everyday conditions. The combined range figure was calculated from multiple everyday driving scenarios. Those driving scenarios were recorded repeatedly in a lab environment in identical conditions. Kia said the ‘City’ range figure was 375 miles and the ‘Combined’ range figure was 285 miles. They had only used the ‘Combined’ WLTP figure in the ads, because they assumed a variance in customer driving and wished to provide a fair representation of the vehicle’s range capability. They provided the ‘Whole Vehicle Type Approval’ (WVTA) document, produced by IDIADA Automotive Technology, which outlined the WLTP testing for the Niro EV. They said a WVTA was required for all vehicles to certify compliance with safety, environmental, and conformity of production requirements. Following a repeated test procedure on a set of vehicles, a WVTA was granted. Kia said, that like all other manufacturers, they were legally bound to present those figures and only those to the public. The 285 miles (combined) range was not their own, but one that had to be legally presented. Kia said that the asterisk in “Range of 285 miles*” in ad (b) should have taken consumers to a section of the website related to WLTP testing. Kia stated that if a Niro EV displayed that it was 100% charged, the vehicle would present a range figure on the dashboard which stated the range the vehicle’s computer believed the car could achieve on that charge. That information would be based on previous driving style, vehicle feature usage, and external environment factors. If the efficiency of the driving thereafter was different, the range figure would adapt to accommodate that. The range figure stated on the dashboard when the battery was at 100% therefore may not have been the final mileage that was achieved on the battery cycle.Kia told us that while the Niro EV had an independently confirmed WLTP ‘Combined’ range of 285 miles, some external reports had found that colder temperatures and inefficient driving styles could result in a lower range, and that applied to any battery-based electric vehicle. They also stated that in the summer months, when temperatures were warmer, several Kia EV drivers had achieved range figures above the stated WLTP figure of 285 miles (combined).","Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must state significant limitations and qualifications and qualifications must be presented clearly. The ASA considered consumers would interpret the claim “up to 285 mile range” in ad (a) to mean the Niro EV was capable of achieving a 285 mile range as a maximum on a full battery charge in a significant amount of cases. We considered consumers would interpret the claim “Range of 285 miles” in ad (b) to mean that was the representative mileage range for the car on a full battery. We also considered that with both ads, consumers would understand that the advertised range, in this case 285 miles, could be achieved on an amount of charge which was advisable for the car. The evidence provided by Kia showed the combined range figure produced by WLTP testing was 285 miles, and that figure was calculated from multiple everyday driving scenarios which were recorded repeatedly in a lab environment in identical conditions. The mileage was calculated from the battery starting on 100% charge and ending on 0%. WLTP procedure is the testing process for measuring fuel economy for new cars, electric mileage range, and emissions. Additionally, external reports cited by Kia found that cold weather and inefficient driving styles could result in a lower range. Neither ad (a) nor ad (b) provided information to consumers to explain that the mileage range was based on test data. We acknowledged that Kia believed that the asterisk in “Range of 285 miles*” should have directed readers to a section of the website related to WLTP testing. However, the webpage featuring the claim did not include any qualifying text. Furthermore, we understood that various real-world factors, such as speed, style of driving, weather and route conditions, and the age and condition of the battery might affect the range. If any of those conditions were less than optimal, which we considered would occur often, the range achieved in the Niro EV may have been lower than 285 miles. We considered that was significant information, which was material to consumers’ understanding of the battery range achievable in the Niro EV, and therefore should have appeared in the ads. We acknowledged that the term “up to 285 miles” was used in ad (a) to allow for varying driving styles and external environment scenarios. However, consumers were likely to understand that the figure quoted was the achievable range for the vehicle in standard driving conditions; when this was not necessarily the case, the maximum range would, therefore, not always be met. We considered that the claim “up to 285 miles” required clear qualification to explain what it represented. In addition, while the mileage claim was based on the car starting with 100% charge, we understood that it was generally not advisable to charge the car beyond 80%, and therefore any claim based on a 100% charge was not representative. We considered that this was material information which should have appeared in the ads themselves. We understood that ad (b) had been amended to include the text “Battery range figures are official EU test figures for comparative purposes and may not reflect real driving results. Fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are tested using WLTP […]”. However, we considered consumers would have only been aware of that information if they scrolled to the bottom of the ad and read the full page of text. It was therefore insufficiently prominent to counteract the overall misleading impression given by more prominent claims. Because the ads did not make clear that the quoted battery range figures were not necessarily representative of what a user would achieve, and the amended version of ad (b) did not make that information sufficiently prominent, we concluded that the claims “up to 285 mile range” in ad (a), and “Range of 285 miles” in ad (b) were likely to mislead. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.9 and 3.10 (Qualification), and 3.11 (Exaggeration).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Kia UK Ltd t/a Kia to ensure that their future ads contained clear and prominent information to explain the basis of any mileage range claim and to avoid any implication that they were representative of a users’ experience when driving the car.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/kia-uk-ltd-a23-1190884-kia-uk-ltd.html
"ASA Ruling on Mercedes-Benz UK Ltd t/a Smart Car, Mercedes Benz","This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on electric vehicle mileage claims, identified for investigation following complaints received. See also related rulings published on 20 December.","A website and e-brochure for Mercedes Benz, seen on 1 June: a. The website https://www.mercedes-benz.co.uk/ stated “Highlights … EQC”. Below this was the text, “Introducing the EQC … All-electric range of up to 254*”. Qualifying text below stated “*The indicated values were determined according to the prescribed measurement method – Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) …”. At the bottom of the page was a click-through link labelled “Download ebrochure”. (b) The e-brochure stated, under the heading “Model prices” “EQC?400 4MATIC … Electric range 254 miles – WLTP¹”. Qualifying text at the bottom of the page stated “¹The indicated values were determined according to the prescribed measurement method – Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) … Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) require mains electricity for charging, range figures determined with the battery fully charged”. Text at the top of the page stated “CO?¹,*”. Smaller text at the bottom of the page stated “*Figures shown are for comparability purposes; only compare with other cars tested to the same technical procedures. Figures may not reflect real life driving results, which will depend upon a number of factors including the starting charge of the battery”.",,"Mercedes-Benz UK Ltd (Mercedes) told us that the 254-mile range figure in the ads was based on a test starting with a 100% charge in line with WLTP requirements it was not possible from the testing to provide any mileage range at anything other than 100%. They said that if the customer did not need to travel that distance, then it was recommended they only charge the battery to 80% to maximise the life of the battery. The owner’s manual said to only charge the battery to 100 percent when required. Mercedes explained that in the e-brochure, it was caveated that the claim be used for comparison purposes only. This allowed consumers to easily compare the range of the EQC with other vehicles, since WLTP mileage range testing was standardised as measuring mileage from an initial charge of 100%.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information and must state significant limitations and qualifications. Ad (a) stated, “Introducing the EQC…All-electric range of up to 254*”. Next to that further text said, “Charge in approx. 40 minutes**” and small print below stated “** … Times are from 10-80% charge”. The website clarified that the mileage was based on the WLTP standard. However, while some readers may have understood the term and what it represented, a significant number would not. It was not clear that the standard was to be used for comparison only or that the range was based on a 100% battery charge. In addition, because it said that the charge time was approximately 40 minutes and that was based on charging from 10% to 80%, consumers were likely to understand that the 254-mile range was routinely achievable and could be completed on 80% charge. Ad (b) stated “EQC?400 4MATIC … Electric range 254 miles – WLTP¹ …” and was qualified with footnote text to explain that the range advertised was achieved through a testing protocol and stated “¹… range figures determined with the battery fully charged”. It additionally stated “*Figures shown are for comparison purposes … Figures may not reflect real life driving results, which will depend upon a number of factors including the starting charge of the battery”. However, that claim began with an asterisk in the text, which indicated it qualified a linked claim. A separate category “CO?¹,*” at the top of the page, included an asterisk, whereas the mileage range figure did not. We therefore considered that consumers who followed the qualifying link would understand that it related to the CO2 emissions of the vehicle, rather than to its mileage range. Consumers were likely to understand from the information provided that the EQC could complete 254 miles starting on a 100% charge and, in the absence of any further qualifying information, that charging to 100% and achieving a 254-mile range was typical and representative of the car. The ASA acknowledged Mercedes’ explanation that they could only provide a mileage range with the car starting at 100% charge because that was how the WLTP tested it. However, in the absence of information to explain that the mileage figures were to be used for comparison purposes only and based on testing conditions, rather than real-world driving, readers were likely to understand it as representative. In addition, we understood that consumers were not advised to charge the car to 100%, since that was detrimental to the battery. We considered that the fact that the mileage figure was based on a battery charged to 100%, which was not representative of the vehicle’s recommended capability in use, was material information which should have been made clear. Given that the website implied that the range figure was based on an 80% charge, rather than 100%, and material information about the unrepresentative basis of the 100% charge range figure did not appear in the website or e-brochure, we concluded that the ads were misleading. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Mercedes-Benz UK Ltd to ensure that future marketing communications stated significant limitations and qualifications, did not omit material information about the mileage achievable in a particular vehicle, and made clear the basis of any mileage range.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/mercedes-benz-uk-ltd-a23-1202889-mercedes-benz-cars-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Petfre (Gibraltar) Ltd t/a Betfred,,"An ad for Live Betfred Casino seen during the programme PrestonPlayz on The Roku Channel, an over-the-top streaming service, on 17 April 2023. The ad included a voice-over which stated, “Welcome to Betfred Casino. Here you can play a range of slot and table games or take a seat in our live casino.”",,"Petfre (Gibraltar) Ltd t/a Betfred said that whenever they bought media, they took proactive steps to ensure that they complied with the Code, and that any third-party agency was also compliant. They said the media in question was sourced through their media agency via a further media agency that focused on addressable TV. They had instructed their media agency that the ad should specifically only be broadcast to adults and that any content that was aimed at under 18s should be removed from the media supply. Betfred said the addressable TV agency had confirmed that they had received those instructions from Betfred’s media agency, and that they shared them with Roku at the start of the campaign. Their target audience for the ad was based on third-party survey data. The habits and lifestyles of individuals over the age of 16 were surveyed and mapped out, allowing companies to identify target audiences based on adult behaviours. That data was used to target the ad to men aged between 25 and 44 years who used online sports betting sites at least once a year, spent money on betting, or used a smartphone or tablet to access online sports betting. Once the target audience was built, it was uploaded into a programmatic database that matched the targeting with media options such as the Roku platform. Roku was a streaming service that provided free-to-use and subscription-based services. To access both services, users had to register for an account and confirm they were over 18. All content that had appeal to children was removed from its ad inventory availability. Roku offered a children’s-only media channel that was available through a dedicated app, as well as the ability to set parental controls. Betfred stated that because Roku required registered users to be over 18, the viewers of PrestonPlayz (the programme during which the ad was seen), must have been over the age of 18. If someone who was under 18 had used an adult’s account to access the content, this was beyond their control, and breached Roku’s terms of use. Betfred said the show was not categorised as “Kids-Directed” by Roku. Because of this, it was not unreasonable to assume that the percentage of users under the age of 18 was below 25%, though they confirmed that they did not have access to audience data for individual programmes. They said that they were not able to provide programme demographics for the individual audience of PrestonPlayz beyond its categorisation as not being “Kids-Directed”. Betfred said they were disappointed that the standards they put in place internally failed due to actions outside of their direct control. They confirmed that they would continue to work with all their external partners to ensure that their ads complied with Code.Roku, Inc t/a Roku said that most of the content on its platform, including PrestonPlayz, was licensed from third-party content providers. To help determine what ads were appropriate for viewers, they required third-party content providers to label content that was directed at, or made primarily for viewing by, children as “Made for Kids”. Roku also tagged content as “Made for Kids” where the genre label was “children”, or if it was tagged as “animated” and the content also had an age rating of U, PG, 12, or 12A. Any ad inventory within content that was labelled as “Made for Kids” was not made available through their ads partner, to help prevent non-compliant ads from being displayed within that content. They also had a section within their channel called “Kids and Family” where “Made for Kids” content and content they had determined as appropriate for family viewing was made available for streaming; gambling ads were not permitted to run in “Kids and Family” content. The PrestonPlayz content had not been labelled as “Made for Kids” by the content provider and was not included in their “Kids and Family” section. Regarding the targeting options available to advertisers for ad inventory in such as the PrestonPlayz programme, Roku said they contractually obliged all advertisers and agencies purchasing ad inventory to comply with all applicable laws. The inventory was made available, through Roku’s ads partner, to advertisers who were then able to apply their own targeting parameters. They clarified that the ad in question was shown because the content provider for PrestonPlayz did not identify the content as “Made for Kids”, and other information available to Roku (such as genre and ratings) did not suggest that the content would be appealing to children. Roku said that according to their terms and conditions, Roku account holders must be 18 or older. They acknowledged that it was possible for a Roku device to be used by individuals within the account holder’s household, which could include children. However, they did not know whether any of the channel’s viewers were under 18. Account holders could set up parental controls to require a PIN password to stream titles rated as PG or higher.","Upheld CAP Code rule 16.3.13 required that marketing communications for gambling must not be directed at those aged younger than 18 years through the selection of media or context in which they appeared. Ads for gambling must not appear in media that was commissioned for or with a disproportionately large audience of under-18s, i.e. more than 25% of the overall audience. In addition, age-restricted ads on streaming platforms should not be targeted solely based on age data, because of younger users misreporting their age or different people sharing the same streaming services, and advertisers should support that method of targeting by using interest-based factors to help remove those aged under 18 years of age from the target audience of gambling product ads. The ASA therefore considered that marketers should be able to demonstrate that they had taken reasonable steps to ensure that gambling ads were directed at an audience aged 18 and over to minimise exposure of under-18s to such ads. The ad appeared in the Roku app, during the programme PrestonPlayz. The programme was dedicated to Minecraft, a well-known game that was largely, although not exclusively, aimed at children and showed content that was likely to appeal to children. Furthermore, the programme, which included vivid, cartoonish presentation and blocky visuals, and a presenter who used exaggerated mannerisms and a lively way of speaking, resembled children’s programmes. For those reasons, we considered that the programme was directed at children. Roku users were required to self-declare that they were aged 18 or over in order to create an account. However, ages could be misreported, and streaming services were commonly shared between adults and younger users within a household. In any case, because no data was available on the number of under-18s who viewed the channel or the programme, we were unable to gain an insight into the proportion of viewers under the age of 18, even on a self-declaration basis. As stated above, we considered that, PrestonPlayz was likely to appeal particularly to under-18s. We accepted that Betfred had targeted the ads based on “adult behaviours”: those who used online sports betting sites at least once a year, spent money on betting, or used a smartphone or tablet to access online sports betting. However, these criteria were not sufficient to prevent the ad from being seen around a programme directed at children. For those reasons, we considered that the ad was directed at those below the age of 18 through the selection of media in which it appeared and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 16.1 and 16.3.13 (Gambling).","The ad must not be used again without further, specific targeting to minimise the likelihood of under-18s being exposed to it. We told Petfre (Gibraltar) Ltd t/a Betfred to ensure that ads were appropriately targeted in future, including ensuring that they did not appear in media which was commissioned for or with a disproportionately large audience of under-18s.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/petfre--gibraltar--ltd-a23-1194957-petfre--gibraltar--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on REVIV UK Ltd t/a REVIV,"This ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on advertising claims about the health benefits of intravenous nutritional therapy (IVNT), identified for investigation following complaints received and intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 20 December 2023.","The website for REVIV UK, www.revivme.com/london, seen 1 April 2019, stated on the main page for its London clinic “REVIV IV infusion therapies deliver hydration, vitamins, and antioxidants helping to optimise vital hydration balance and maximise your wellness & efficiency. Whether looking to boost your immune system […], REVIV offers a quick and efficient way to restore your body to a healthy balance”. Text underneath the heading “REVIV London Prices” listed the intravenous (IV) drips available and their prices: “Hydromax™ ¦ Hydration IV”; “Ultraviv® ¦ Recovery IV”; “Megaboost® ¦ Vitamin IV”; “Vitaglow® ¦ Glutathione IV”; “Royal Flush™ ¦ Deluxe IV”. The IV drip names were linked to individual pages which included additional claims about the health benefits of each of the drips.",The ASA challenged whether the claimed health benefits of the IV drips were misleading and could be substantiated.,"REVIV UK Ltd t/a REVIV said they gave a specific formulation for an IV drip for each of their clients after a consultation at one of their clinics with a medical or clinical practitioner, all of whom were registered healthcare providers such as doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics or operating department practitioners. Their prices reflected the involvement of registered healthcare practitioners in the selection of their drips as well as their administration. They provided a wellness service, rather than just a product; the IV drips could not be directly purchased from the website. They were registered with the Care Quality Commission and had been rated by them as ‘Good’. REVIV said the claim “REVIV IV infusion therapies deliver hydration, vitamins and antioxidants helping to optimise vital hydration balance and maximise your wellness & efficiency. […] REVIV offers a quick and efficient way to restore your body to a healthy balance”, which appeared on the main London clinic web page, simply stated what they did, rather than what they offered. With regard to the claim on the London clinic home page that REVIV drips “boost your immune system” REVIV said that this was delivered primarily from their drips which contained vitamin C: the Ultraviv, Megaboost, Vitaglow and Royal Flush drips. In support of the claims they referred to two papers relating to vitamin C and the immune system. They highlighted that one, an abstract, stated that vitamin C was needed for some cells in the immune system to perform their tasks and therefore a deficiency in vitamin C resulted in reduced resistance against certain pathogens, while a higher supply enhanced several immune parameters. It stated that studies, including meta-analyses, underlined that the prophylactic intake of vitamin C might slightly reduce the duration of the common cold in healthy people, but that it did not affect the incidence or severity of the common cold. It also stated that vitamin C supplementation was most effective in cases of physical strain or insufficient intake of the vitamin. The second paper was a literature review. REVIV highlighted that it stated that vitamin C appeared to exert a multitude of beneficial effects on cellular functions of both the innate and adaptive immune system and that it was necessary for the immune system to mount and sustain an adequate response against pathogens. Hydromax drip In relation to the Hydromax drip, REVIV provided substantiation which they said supported the claims in the ad that related to its efficacy for dehydration, flushing out lactic acid, and detoxification. Three documents related to dehydration. The first paper related to a study of hydration levels in Chilean professional football players, of which only the abstract was in English. REVIV said the study was intended to assess the athletes’ normal hydration status and it found that 98% of them showed moderate to severe dehydration before regular training practices. The abstract stated that this might negatively affect an athlete’s performance and increase their risk of heat-related injuries. REVIV also provided a chapter on volume depletion (dehydration) from a medical textbook, highlighting that intravenous 0.9% saline was given when volume deficits were severe or oral fluid replacement was impractical. A further article from a medical journal relating to disorders of sodium and water balance stated that the first priority in patients with water and/or sodium imbalance was to correct dehydration and then reassess sodium balance and treat with an appropriate solution to correct sodium balance. With regard to the claim that the Hydromax drip “Flushes Out Lactic Acid”, REVIV referred to a case report in a medical journal which summarised the clinical presentation of a patient with lactic acidosis (a medical condition in which the body overproduced or underutilised lactic acid, but was unable to adjust to those changes) and how it was treated. REVIV highlighted that the report stated that resuscitative efforts to support circulation and ventilation were the first steps in treating lactic acidosis, and that there were proponents of both saline and balanced salt solutions as the treatment for fluid resuscitation in such circumstances. To support the claim that the Hydromax drip had a detoxifying effect, REVIV referred to a medical journal article about the medical condition rhabdomyolysis (the breakdown of damaged skeletal muscle), noting that the article stated that treatment of the condition was primarily directed at preserving kidney function, and that treatment was via intravenous saline. Ultraviv drip To support the claim that the Ultraviv drip delivered an “energy boost”, REVIV said that fatigue was a common condition which could result from factors including but not limited to malnutrition, dehydration, stress, illness and mood disorders. They said that the administration of fluid, replacement of nutrients and treatment of inflammation associated with illness could reduce fatigue and provide a boost of energy. They referred to three papers. The first, a review article, looked at post-match fatigue and its treatment in professional footballers. It said post-match fatigue was multifactorial and mainly related to dehydration, glycogen depletion, muscle damage and mental fatigue, and that recovery strategies should be targeted against those major causes of fatigue. REVIV highlighted that the second document, a clinical review of fever-illnesses in athletes, stated that fever was correlated with an increase in insensible fluid losses, dehydration, metabolic demands, and dysregulation of body temperature. It could have detrimental effects on the musculoskeletal system, including decreasing strength and endurance, generalised muscle catabolism, and an increase in perceived fatigue. A further review article discussed vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency, finding that it had been correlated negatively with cognitive functioning in healthy elderly subjects, with symptoms including slow mentation, memory impairment, attention deficits and dementia. The ad also included claims about the Ultraviv drip’s efficacy in restoring hydration. REVIV referred to the same evidence referenced above in relation to such claims. Megaboost drip REVIV said that the claim “Antioxidant Therapy”, which was made in relation to the Megaboost drip, could also be attributed to the drip’s vitamin C content. They provided an article which reviewed evidence relating to vitamin C’s role as an antioxidant in humans. They highlighted that the article stated that epidemiological studies showed that diets high in fruit and vegetables were associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancer, and with increased longevity, but that it was not known whether those protective effects could be attributed to vitamin C, and that intervention studies using vitamin C had not shown any change in markers of oxidation or clinical benefit. An additional article, in which the author summarised relevant published clinical research and described his own use of the ‘Myers’ Cocktail’ (an IV infusion developed by a US physician) as a treatment, stated that the Myers’ Cocktail had been found to be effective in a wide range of medical conditions and disorders. REVIV also referred to the documents provided in support of the claims to boost the immune system, and to the document provided in relation to Hydromax’s detoxifying effect.Vitaglow dripREVIV said the Vitaglow drip contained saline, vitamin C, glutathione and n-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). They provided four documents relating to glutathione and to NAC, to support claims that the Vitaglow drip “Prevents & Reverses Effects of Free Radicals”. The first, a review article, reviewed literature relating to the antioxidant role of glutathione and NAC supplements. It said that an increase in exercise intensity was one of the ways in which oxidative stress and free radical production increased in human cells, which in turn could be related to some conditions such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. It was therefore possible that a decrease in the amount of oxidative stress a cell was exposed to could increase health and performance. The article stated that glutathione and NAC were antioxidants which could minimise oxidative stress and highlighted that supplements with those substances were popular. The second paper, an abstract, summarised the antioxidant and chemopreventive properties of glutathione and NAC and referred to a large study investigating the long-term daily usage of NAC supplementation in high-risk individuals to prevent a second occurrence of primary lung cancer. A third article summarised the role of glutathione in the body, and stated that glutathione deficiency contributed to oxidative stress, which played a key role in ageing and the pathogenesis of many diseases. It stated that new knowledge of the nutritional regulation of glutathione metabolism was critical for the development of effective strategies to improve health and treat such diseases. The fourth paper, published in 1997, described a randomised controlled trial (RCT) which investigated whether glutathione delivered intravenously would enhance the feasibility of giving six cycles of chemotherapy to women with ovarian cancer, without dose reduction due to toxicity. The study found that glutathione allowed more cycles of chemotherapy to be administered because less toxicity was observed and patient quality of life was improved. In support of the claims that the Vitaglow drip improved the appearance of skin and resulted in “glowing” skin, REVIV provided one abstract of a study and one full study relating to the role of glutathione as a skin lightening agent. The abstract described a study which investigated the effects of glutathione supplementation on the lightness of the skin of 30 Filipino women, concluding that it was safe and effective. The full study related to a double-blind and placebo-controlled trial investigating the effects of a topical glutathione preparation on skin whiteness, skin moisture content, smoothness, wrinkle formation and elasticity. The study concluded there was increased moisture, suppression of wrinkle formation, improvement in skin smoothness and that the preparation effectively whitened skin. Royal Flush drip REVIV said that the Royal Flush drip incorporated all the elements of the Megaboost, Vitaglow and Ultraviv drips, referring to the evidence provided in relation to each of those three drips.","Upheld The ad described five IV drips offered by REVIV, including on individual web pages a range of claims about the health benefits provided by each drip. In the descriptions of the drips, the ad also included some claims about the role that some of the specific substances in the drips played in the body, and the health benefits they provided. The ASA considered that consumers would therefore understand that the health benefits associated with those specific substances would be provided by the described drip. We considered that the average consumer who viewed the web pages relating to the advertiser’s IV drips, and to whom the claims were clearly addressed, would be generally healthy but interested in products which might support or enhance specific aspects of their health and wellbeing, or support their preparation for or recovery from specific events, including intensive exercise. We considered those consumers would have some understanding that the body required certain levels of vitamins, minerals and other substances to support its normal functioning. We noted that the London clinic web page included the claim “[…] whether its[sic] work or play that’s taking its toll, REVIV provides a quick and efficient way to rehydrate and re-energize via IV infusions […] helping to optimise vital hydration balance and maximise your wellness & efficiency […] REVIV offers a quick and efficient way to restore your body to healthy balance”. IV drips were delivered via an invasive method which we considered consumers would generally associate with medical uses, and single drips were offered by IV clinics in the UK at prices generally ranging from around £100 to around £400; at the time the ads were viewed, REVIV’s prices ranged from £99 to £349 for a single drip. In that context, and in the context of the claims referenced above, we considered consumers were likely to expect that an IV drip was an instantaneous, and therefore more effective, or superior way, of delivering essential nutrients to normally healthy people than other methods (such as through diet or regular oral supplementation) and therefore would also provide superior health benefits more quickly than the same nutrients administered through other methods. We considered consumers would understand that the nutrients delivered via a single IV drip would result in a one-off increase in the availability of those nutrients to be utilised by the body, whereas diet and oral supplementation provided a daily regular, ongoing source of those nutrients. However, consumers would be unlikely to have knowledge of how long the various nutrients administered via a single IV drip would be available for utilisation by the body or how long the claimed health benefit might therefore last. As a result they were likely to base their understanding of how long the health benefit might last on information in the ad, where relevant information was included. This could include, for example, references to a ‘course’ of drips or recommended frequency of administration, the overall impression created by the claims, the name of the drip or other elements of the ad. We understood that human nutritional needs were complex, requiring different amounts of different nutrients at differing frequencies to ensure normal functioning of the body, and these needs varied from person to person depending on a range of factors such as biological sex, age, levels of physical activity and so on. Human nutritional needs were answered through diet and, in the case of vitamin D, exposure to the sun. We took expert advice on what type and standard of evidence would be relevant to claims about the health benefits of IVNT drips. The expert firstly referenced evidence for advertising claims about the health benefits of IVNT drips which did not include that IVNT would provide superior health benefits compared to diet or oral supplementation. For such claims, they advised that evidence relating to the health benefits of oral supplementation could be relevant to support claims relating to IVNT. Such evidence would, however, have to provide robust evidence of the correlation between a particular dose of a nutrient (i.e. the quantity provided, frequency of provision and duration of provision) and a particular health benefit. The IVNT drip would have to be of the same or greater dose than the oral supplement. The advertiser would have to demonstrate that the particular formulation of the drip did not include other nutrients or components which could adversely affect the effectiveness of the key nutrient (e.g. amino acids that bound to zinc or copper). They would also have to demonstrate that interaction with the gut microbiome was not necessary to achieve the health benefit, which may be the case for some nutrients such as polyphenols and glucosinolates. The expert secondly referenced evidence for advertising claims that IVNT would provide superior health benefits compared to other methods of administration of the same nutrients, such as through diet or oral supplementation. IV administration would achieve peak plasma concentrations of a substance more quickly than oral administration, although the speed at which this was achieved would vary between nutrients. It also achieved 100% bioavailability under the pharmacological definition (the fraction of the administered drug that reached the systemic circulation), but there was a lack of consensus as to the definition of bioavailability in relation to nutrients. Consequently, they considered there was not sufficient evidence to support assertions that IVNT offered superior bioavailability compared to oral administration for all nutrients. For claims that IVNT would provide superior health benefits to other methods of administration, they advised that evidence would need to relate to the immediate and superior efficacy of the specific drips the advertiser sold, or substances contained in them. Such evidence would ideally consist of appropriately designed RCTs comparing the health benefit effects of IVNT with a placebo drip and with oral supplementation with the same formulation and at the same dose. Alternatively, such evidence could consist of appropriately designed observational studies comparing reported or measured health end-points of users of IVNT with individuals who routinely took the same nutrients in a different form, at similar doses. Those studies would also have to be adequately controlled in terms of inclusion criteria and other likely mitigating variables. Such evidence should have clinically significant outcomes that were directly relevant to the health benefits claimed in the advertising. Evidence relating to the health benefits of regular oral supplementation would not be sufficient, but evidence relating to intramuscular injection could be, as its mode of delivery was similar to IV drip. The expert further advised that evidence relating to the effects of nutrients on individuals suffering from a deficiency of that nutrient would not be relevant to claims about the health benefits of IVNT in normally healthy individuals, regardless of the method by which the nutrient was administered. Evidence relating to the effects of nutrients on individuals suffering from a medical condition that was not a nutrient deficiency could be adequate to support claims about the health effects of IVNT, whichever method of administration was used. However, such evidence would have to show that the provision of the nutrient led to improvements in a measure that was not related to the medical condition or to symptoms caused by side effects of any ongoing medical treatment. The expert understood that such evidence was likely to be scant. The ASA understood that IV administration delivered 100% of a nutrient to the systemic circulation and achieved peak plasma concentrations more swiftly than via oral supplementation. However, we understood that the speed at which peak plasma concentration would be achieved varied between nutrients, and that a range of other factors, including the composition of the particular IV drip formulation, could affect the body’s use of those nutrients and the delivery of any health benefits. We considered the type and standard of evidence we would expect to see, taking into account the context of how consumers would interpret the advertising claims as outlined above: that IVNT would provide a superior way of delivering essential nutrients than other methods to normally healthy people and therefore would also provide superior health benefits more quickly than the same nutrients administered through other methods.We therefore expected to see evidence which related to the immediate and superior efficacy of the specific drips sold by the advertiser, or drips with the same formulation and dosage as referenced in the ad (including regularity of administration), preferably in humans who were normally healthy. Evidence relating to people with a clinical nutrient deficiency or which examined the effects of a nutrient as a treatment for a medical condition would not be relevant to advertising claims directed at generally healthy consumers. Evidence relating to people with a medical condition would only be relevant if it clearly established that the measures by which health benefits were assessed were unrelated to either the medical condition or to symptoms caused by associated medical treatments. We expected all evidence, whether consisting of RCTs or observational studies, to be methodologically robust with clinically significant outcomes that were directly relevant to the health benefits claimed in the advertising.In addition to documentation provided by REVIV in support of their advertising, we also reviewed other evidence we had seen which related to the claims in their advertising. Hydromax drip The description for the Hydromax drip stated “BENEFITS – Restores Hydration – Rebalances Body Salts – Flushes Out Lactic Acid – Detoxification. BEST FOR – Optimal Athletic Performance – Recovery from Exhausting Activity – Dehydration. REVIV’s Hydromax IV therapy is used by athletes to hydrate before exhausting athletic activity and also post activity to properly rehydrate. Hydromax is also best for correcting general dehydration. Sport & fitness activity such as a marathon, triathlon, or MMA/cross-fit training, generates lactic acid build up in your muscles and depletes your body’s hydration. Besides restoring hydration, Hydromax IV therapy also delivers minerals, antioxidants and electrolytes to detoxify your body and reenergize you after exercise or general dehydration.”Given the context referenced above, we considered consumers would understand from the ad that hydrating via the Hydromax drip provided benefits over and above those provided through oral fluid intake (i.e. drinking water or electrolyte drinks) in ensuring adequate hydration in generally healthy people, particularly if it was administered shortly before or after undertaking strenuous physical activity. We considered consumers were likely to expect that these benefits would include achieving greater and more effective levels of hydration, more quickly, than could be achieved through oral fluid intake. In combination with the references to rebalancing body salts, flushing lactic acid and detoxifying the body, we considered consumers would also understand those benefits to include improved performance during sporting activity and generally quicker and more effective recovery from post-exercise fatigue than could be achieved through drinking water or electrolyte drinks, including reduced muscle pain and soreness over a shorter time period than they would otherwise have experienced. REVIV had identified five documents in support of the claims for the Hydromax drip. We also reviewed additional documents they had provided, and other documents we had seen that we considered related to the claims as consumers would understand them and which related to the substances in the drip: saline, magnesium and NAC. The medical manual chapter on volume depletion provided an overview of the condition and recommended that IV saline be given to patients with severe dehydration or when oral fluid replacement was impractical. A journal article provided an overview of the conditions hypernatremia and hyponatremia (abnormally high and low sodium levels) and recommended IV infusion as a treatment. The two articles referred to by REVIV in relation to the claims to flush lactic acid and detoxify the body described the conditions lactic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis and recommended IV saline as a treatment. A clinical review of febrile illnesses in athletes highlighted that fever could affect physical performance, was correlated with dehydration, and that participating in strenuous exercise with a fever could exacerbate dehydration. The journal article relating to the Myers’ Cocktail, provided by REVIV, included a reference to the IV infusion providing an “energy boost” for an athlete, but this was in the context of the drip being administered as treatment for a flu-like illness. Those documents focused on the use of saline as a treatment for medical conditions and therefore were not relevant to advertising claims aimed at generally healthy people experiencing normal levels of water and sodium loss, fatigue, muscle pain and soreness following strenuous physical activity. A further study examined the impact of food intake on the gastrointestinal absorption and effectiveness of an anti-diuretic medicine. Saline IV drips were used to hydrate the healthy participants in a study design which, for the purpose of accurate measurement, required that participants did not drink anything (or eat anything other than specific meals) during the trial. We considered the study demonstrated the use of saline IV drips as a method of hydration by researchers but noted that IV administration was used rather than oral rehydration in order to make precise measurements relevant to the outcome measures of the study rather than having outcome measures relevant to the advertising claims. A series of four articles described levels of dehydration in professional football players in Chile, how dehydration was thought to affect performance in training and matches, and strategies for recovery, although we had not been provided with full copies, in English, of two of those documents. A further article provided a general overview of research on hydration and health. The articles did not relate to hydration via IV drip and did not comment on whether there was greater value in IV drips over drinking water or electrolyte drinks for ensuring adequate hydration, including in the context of strenuous physical exercise. REVIV had also provided a review article which looked at the role of NAC (and glutathione) on exercise-induced oxidative stress. The reviewed studies were largely conducted using IV administration of the substance, but the article did not contain sufficient information for us to evaluate their methodological robustness or relevance to the claims made in relation to the Hydromax drip. An RCT investigating the effect of oral magnesium supplementation on physical performance in healthy elderly women involved in a weekly exercise programme over a three-month period did not blind participants. The key outcome measure saw a significant effect in the treatment group versus the control group, but because the study was not blinded, involved only elderly women and was based on oral supplementation, we considered it was not adequate to support advertising claims for an IV drip. We had also seen an RCT examining whether dietary zinc magnesium aspartate (ZMA) supplementation in resistance-trained men, administered during training, affected zinc and magnesium status, anabolic and catabolic hormone profiles and/or training adaptations. While we understood that ZMA contained zinc and vitamin B6 as well as magnesium aspartate, we nonetheless reviewed its relevance to the claims made in relation to the Hydromax drip. However, the RCT involved only a small number of participants, showed no significant differences in the results of its three outcome measures and related to a dietary supplement. We concluded it therefore was not adequate evidence to support advertising claims made in relation to an IV drip. We considered the evidence demonstrated that maintaining adequate levels of hydration was important to the normal functioning of the body, but that it did not demonstrate that IV drips provided benefits over and above oral fluid intake in maintaining (or restoring) adequate levels of hydration in normally healthy people undertaking either normal levels of physical activity or particularly strenuous activity. Nor did the evidence demonstrate that administering the Hydromax drip shortly before or after strenuous exercise would deliver improved performance or quicker and more effective recovery, including reduced muscle pain and soreness. Ultraviv drip The description of the Ultraviv drip stated “BENEFITS – Restores Hydration […] Delivers an Energy Boost. BEST FOR […] – REVIV’s Ultraviv Recovery IV therapy is formulated to replenish hydration […]. The elements of life can leave you susceptible to feeling run down. While Ultraviv replenishes your body’s hydration level it also adds vital minerals, antioxidants, electrolytes and vitamins […] Ultraviv provides an energy boost that will return you to feeling like your former self. FAST RECOVERY”. We considered consumers would understand from those claims that the drip would provide an increase in levels of energy for people who were generally healthy but who were feeling tired and rundown due to their lifestyle. In the context of the refences to a “boost”, “feeling run down” and “FAST RECOVERY”, we considered consumers were likely to expect those benefits to last a few days to a short number of weeks. REVIV had referenced seven documents in relation to energy boosting and hydration in support of the advertising claims. We also reviewed other documents we had seen which related to the substances included in the drip (vitamin B12, vitamin C, magnesium and NAC) and which related to the claims in the ad as consumers would understand them. We assessed the same evidence relating to hydration that we reviewed in relation to the claims for the Hydromax drip to determine whether it supported claims that the Ultraviv drip would provide increased energy. This included two of the documents REVIV had provided specifically to support claims that the Ultraviv drip could provide an energy boost. While, as referenced above, we considered the evidence demonstrated that maintaining adequate levels of hydration was important to the normal functioning of the body, including in maintaining normal energy levels, it did not demonstrate that IV drips improved energy levels in normally healthy people. The additional document provided by REVIV specifically in relation to the ‘energy boost’ claim was a review article relating to vitamin B12. We had also seen a further three review articles in relation to vitamin B12. The articles summarised the causes and health implications of vitamin B12 deficiency and confirmed its importance for the normal functioning of the body, particularly the nervous system and blood cell formation. They also highlighted the need to maintain adequate levels in the body, particularly for vegans and vegetarians who were more likely to have inadequate levels of vitamin B12 in the body as it was primarily found in animal products. However, the articles did not support claims that an IV infusion of vitamin B12 could increase energy levels in generally healthy people. We had seen three documents relating to the effects of vitamin C on energy/fatigue levels. An article examined data from a largescale observational study (20,000 participants) in the UK to identify risk factors for vitamin C deficiency and found a correlation between low vitamin C levels and self-reported poorer physical health. Risk factors were: being older, male, of lower socioeconomic status and educational attainment, no alcohol intake, being a smoker, and having low levels of physical activity. The authors reported that the findings suggested that vitamin C supplementation was likely to only have an impact on those with the lowest levels of vitamin C and we considered that many of the risk factors they identified for low vitamin C levels were less likely to be present in the audience for the ad. A further study assessed the effects of 6g of oral vitamin C on fatigue in normally healthy office workers over a period of two weeks, but because it was not controlled or blinded and did not relate to IV administered vitamin C it was not adequate evidence for advertising claims relating to IV vitamin C. Finally, an RCT examined the effects of an IV drip containing 10mg of vitamin C on fatigue and oxidative stress in normally healthy office workers in the Republic of Korea. The RCT was randomised, placebo-controlled and double-blinded: 73 were in the treatment group and 74 in the control group, who were administered IV saline only. Participants were aged between 20 and 49 years and had no vitamin supplement intake in the two days before enrolment in the study. Each participant was administered one drip. The primary outcome measures were the differences in self-reported fatigue score at two hours and at one day after the intervention, comparing between the groups. Secondary outcome measures were between-group comparisons of oxidative stress levels at two hours and at one day after the intervention, and a between-group comparison of plasma vitamin C concentration at two hours after intervention. The authors reported that fatigue score was significantly decreased in the vitamin C group compared to the placebo group at both two hours and one day after intervention, although this was evident in subjects with a lower vitamin C level at baseline, but not for those with a higher level. However, the fatigue score was reported on a zero to ten scale and the difference between mean score for the groups was, even specifically for those with lower vitamin C levels at baseline, only 0.43 at two hours after intervention and 1.14 one day after intervention. We considered the study did not demonstrate that such differences on a ten-point scale constituted a clinically significant difference. The authors also reported that oxidative stress was lower in the treatment group at two hours compared to the placebo group, but not at one day. They concluded that there was no significant relationship between fatigue and oxidative stress. While the RCT was well-designed, we considered its findings did not constitute adequate evidence that a vitamin C IV drip of any dose improved energy levels or decreased fatigue. We had also seen a journal article which described the Myers’ Cocktail (which included vitamin C) providing an energy boost to an athlete with a flu-like illness. We had seen one RCT relating to magnesium and one RCT relating to ZMA (which contained magnesium), and a review article relating to NAC which had some relevance to claims about energy levels. As referenced in our review of those documents in relation to the Hydromax drip, those documents were not adequate to support such advertising claims. We concluded the evidence was not adequate to support claims that the Ultraviv drip would provide, over any period of time, increased levels of energy for people who were generally healthy, but who were feeling tired and rundown because of their lifestyle. Megaboost drip The description of the Megaboost drip included the claims “BENEFITS – Restores Hydration – Replenishes Essential Minerals & Vitamins – Delivers A High Dose Of Vitamin C – Antioxidant Therapy – Boosts Immune System – Detoxifies Your Body – Adds an Energy Boost. BEST FOR – Maintain Good Health & Wellness – Strengthen Your Immune System – Increase Vitality […] This hydrating vitamin and nutrient IV contains an extra high dose of Vitamin C coupled with minerals, antioxidants and electrolytes aimed to boost the immune system, detoxify the body and increase strength and energy. Megaboost is an enhanced Myers’ Cocktail formulated as a comprehensive IV therapy for maintaining good health & wellness […] and boosting the immune system […]”.We considered many consumers would be aware that vitamin C contributed to the normal functioning of the immune system, and of its purported benefits in preventing or helping to treat illnesses, particularly viral illnesses such as colds and flu. In that context we considered they would understand from the references to the drip containing a “high dose” of vitamin C, in conjunction with the references to the drip ‘boosting’ and ‘strengthening’ the immune system, that a single drip would provide an improvement in the functioning of their immune system. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. We considered consumers would also understand from the ad that a single drip would provide better hydration above other methods of hydrating (i.e. drinking water), that it would provide a short-term improvement in the body’s ability to remove toxins, in the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress, and that it would provide a short-term increase in energy levels and strength. We further considered that consumers would understand from the claim that the drip was “formulated as a comprehensive IV therapy for maintaining good health & wellness…” that regular administration of the drip would ensure that the various claimed health benefits would be maintained over time. REVIV had referred to two documents in support of the claim “Antioxidant Therapy”, two in relation to the claims to boost the immune system, and one in relation to the drip’s claimed detoxifying effect. We also reviewed other documents we had seen which related to substances included in the Megaboost drip (vitamin B12, vitamin C, NAC, and vitamins B6, B3, B1 and B2) which related to the claims made in the ad. We had already reviewed documents relating to advertising claims that substances in REVIV’s drips would provide better hydration above other methods of hydrating, improve the body’s ability to remove toxins and provide an increase in energy levels. For the reasons already stated, we concluded that evidence was not adequate to support such claims for IV drips. For the same reasons those documents also did not support claims that an IV drip could increase strength, and we had not seen other relevant evidence relating to strength. In relation to the role of vitamin C in the immune system, REVIV referred to the abstract of a journal article and a literature review. We had seen a further five literature reviews relating to vitamin C and its role in immune function (two of which also discussed the role of certain B vitamins in immunity, referenced below). We had also seen four documents relating to the role of vitamin C in medical conditions: a literature review which described the chemical and biochemical processes by which high dose IV vitamin C might have an impact as a cancer treatment; a study that examined the action of ascorbate on cells infected with HIV; an article about the role of vitamin C in the prevention and treatment of Covid-19; and a small, prospective study on the effects on quality of life in cancer patients of IV vitamin C. A further study examined whether high-dose vitamin C oral supplementation impacted on the steady-state concentration of a drug used to treat HIV. We considered that the literature reviews together confirmed that research had established that vitamin C was important to the normal functioning of the immune system due to its role in protecting cells against oxidative stress, and one stated that epidemiological studies had shown that eating fruit and vegetables could help to protect against some diseases although that could not be directly attributed to vitamin C. However, neither the reviews nor the documents relating to the role of vitamin C in the treatment or prevention of medical conditions were sufficient evidence that vitamin C IV infusions could help improve the functioning of the immune system in normally healthy people. The abstract did not provide sufficient information for us to assess its relevance.In relation to the B vitamins in the drip and their role in the functioning of the immune system, we had seen a textbook chapter about vitamin B2 deficiency, and four articles and a literature review which variously provided information about the immune-related functions of vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B12 (as well as vitamin C and other vitamins and minerals not included in the Megaboost drip). We had also seen four other documents relating to the causes and health implications of vitamin B12 deficiency, as described above in relation to the Ultraviv drip. Additionally, the article referenced above about the role of vitamin C in the prevention and treatment of Covid-19 also discussed the role of vitamins B1, B2, B3 and B6 in the prevention and treatment of that disease. We considered those documents confirmed that B vitamins played a role in immune function, but they were not sufficient or relevant evidence that an IV drip containing those nutrients improved the functioning of the immune system in normally healthy people. We had not seen any evidence relating to the role of NAC in immunity. With regard to the claim that the Megaboost drip improved the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress, we reviewed the literature review and journal article referred to by REVIV as well as other documents we had seen that related to oxidative stress and substances which were included in the drip. This included the two documents relating to the effects of NAC referenced above, the RCT referenced above in relation to the Ultraviv drip, which examined the effects of a vitamin C IV drip on fatigue and oxidative stress, and two literature reviews relating to the role of vitamin C in ageing and Alzheimer’s disease. The journal article featured anecdotal accounts of a doctor’s experience of using the Myers’ Cocktail in their treatment of patients with a range of medical conditions, the study abstract related to participants who were using NAC and who had a high risk of a second occurrence of primary lung cancer, and the literature reviews focused on the possible role of oxidative stress in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Because those documents related to the role of substances in the Megaboost drip in the treatment or prevention of medical conditions rather than to health benefits in generally healthy people we considered they were not relevant to support the claims in the ad. As referenced above in relation to the Hydromax drip, the review article which looked at the role of NAC (and glutathione) on exercise-induced oxidative stress did not provide sufficient information for us to evaluate the methodological robustness of the referenced trials or their relevance to the claims made in relation to the Megaboost drip. It noted that one study which administered vitamin C and NAC together via oral supplementation saw negative effects on oxidative stress. The literature review provided by REVIV was one of those we had also reviewed in relation to vitamin C’s role in immune function, and while the RCT showed a decrease in oxidative stress in the treatment group at two hours compared to the placebo group, this was not maintained at one day. The effect therefore could not be confirmed as having anything other than a very temporary effect and the paper included only a limited amount of analysis about this secondary outcome measure. We considered the evidence confirmed the role of vitamin C in protecting against oxidative stress, but did not demonstrate that IV infusion of vitamin C improved the body’s ability to combat oxidative stress. We concluded the evidence was not adequate to support claims that the Megaboost drip could provide better hydration above other methods of hydrating. We concluded the evidence also was not adequate to support claims that the Megaboost drip would, over any time period, improve the body’s ability to remove toxins and combat oxidative stress, provide an increase in energy levels and strength, or improve the functioning of the immune system and therefore provide greater protection against infection and disease. Vitaglow drip The description for the Vitaglow drip stated “REVIV’s Vitaglow Anti-Aging IV therapy contains a high dose of the master antioxidant Glutathione as well as Vitamin C to help detoxify the body from damaging free radicals and improve the appearance of hair, skin and nails. The ageing process is inevitable and associated with various metabolic changes like declining Glutathione levels your body [sic]. Glutathione acts as the master antioxidant which detoxifies your body and promotes cellular repair. This rejuvenating infusion is typically delivered in 10 minutes or less, giving your body and skin a quick refreshment to help stop time in it’s [sic] tracks” and “SKIN GLOWING”. It also featured bullet points which made similar claims in relation to the drip’s detoxification, antioxidant and anti-ageing benefits, and its benefits for skin, hair and nails. We considered consumers would understand from those claims that the drip would have a general anti-ageing effect on the body and specifically that the appearance of hair, skin and nails would improve as a result of the drip’s antioxidant and detoxifying effects that were delivered particularly by the glutathione and vitamin C in the drip. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. In addition to the claims on the Vitaglow web page relating to the appearance of skin, at the bottom of the web pages for the Hydromax and Royal Flush drips there was an image of an East Asian woman accompanied by the linked text “GLUTATHIONE THERAPY […] Glutathione is an anti-oxidant commonly used for skin lightening. IV Glutathione is used as therapy by some and for detoxification”. We understood that many consumers interested in IV drips advertised for skin health would be aware that glutathione was purported to have skin lightening properties. In that context we considered consumers would understand that REVIV’s drip which included glutathione (Vitaglow) could, in the short-term, lighten skin pigmentation. We reviewed the evidence firstly in relation to whether it supported claims that the Vitaglow drip had an anti-ageing effect, particularly by improving the appearance of skin, hair and nails, and secondly in relation to whether it supported claims that the Vitaglow drip could change skin pigmentation. We understood that the drip contained only saline, vitamin C, glutathione and NAC so we considered only evidence which related to the effects of those substances. REVIV had provided six documents with regard to the effects of glutathione but the majority did not specifically relate to general anti-ageing effects on the body or more specifically to the appearance of hair, skin and nails. The review article they provided which summarised the role of glutathione in the body, described how it was produced by the body from other, ingested, substances. We considered it established the importance of glutathione in the normal functioning of the body, including that it had a role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. It noted that the rate at which glutathione was produced and used by the body meant that in healthy adults, glutathione was used less than two days after it was produced. A further article we had seen also gave an overview of the antioxidative protective roles, measurement and biosynthesis of glutathione, including noting some of its therapeutic uses. However, neither article provided information about the usefulness of direct glutathione supplementation by IV infusion and whether, if increased levels were delivered by such methods, it would have any additional benefits to health, such as having an anti-ageing effect and improving the appearance of hair, skin or nails. They also did not comment on whether there was evidence that glutathione had an effect on skin pigmentation. A one-month trial in which 12 participants aged between 50 and 80 years were given oral glutathione, measured whether it increased levels of glutathione in the body and its effects on oxidative stress and immune function markers. Another study made in vitro assessments of the stability and bioavailability of different formulations of oral glutathione supplements, with an assessment of the glutathione levels achieved in rats following oral administration of those supplements. Those studies were not relevant to the health effects of IV-administered glutathione.We further noted that the review article REVIV provided, which looked at the roles of glutathione and NAC on exercise-induced oxidative stress, did not relate to those substances’ anti-ageing effects, efficacy in improving the appearance of nails, hair or skin or in changing skin pigmentation. It also stated that oral supplementation was an ineffective way of providing glutathione and that one study which administered vitamin C and NAC together via oral supplementation saw negative effects on oxidative stress. An abstract stated that glutathione played a crucial role in the detoxification of xenobiotics, but provided no further detail and referred to a large study investigating the long-term daily usage of NAC supplementation in high-risk individuals to prevent a second occurrence of primary lung cancer. Another document related to the use of glutathione in treating ovarian cancer. The abstract was not adequate to support advertising claims, and both documents related to the roles of those substances in the prevention or treatment of cancer and therefore were not relevant in supporting anti-ageing claims and claims about the appearance of skin, hair and nails in normally healthy people. We had seen five documents which related to the effects of glutathione on skin appearance and condition, and/or its skin lightening effects, two of which were provided by REVIV. The first related to glutathione oral supplementation and skin lightening and was provided in abstract form only. The second related to the topical application of glutathione for skin condition and skin whitening. A literature review, published in 2016, stated that there were no RCTs that looked at the skin lightening effects of IV glutathione despite its common use for that purpose, and that there were only two RCTs relating to its efficacy for skin lightening via oral supplementation (one of which was the abstract provided by REVIV), and one relating to its topical application (as provided by REVIV). Two further RCTs on the antimelanogenic and anti-ageing effects of oral glutathione supplementation post-dated the review. We considered that evidence relating to oral supplementation and topical application of glutathione were not adequate to support advertising claims for glutathione IV drips. We also assessed whether documents REVIV had provided in relation to vitamin C was relevant to the claims made about the Vitaglow drip, as well as other documents we had seen which related to the effects of vitamin C for anti-ageing and the appearance of skin, hair and nails. We had assessed evidence relating to the antioxidant effects of vitamin C in relation to the Megaboost drip. Three documents REVIV provided in relation to the effects of vitamin C all related to its role in the immune system so were not relevant to claims for the Vitaglow drip. The journal article they provided, which was about the Myers’ Cocktail (a key component of which was vitamin C) did not relate to anti-ageing or its efficacy in improving the appearance of hair, skin or nails. We had also seen a review of literature surrounding the roles of vitamin C in skin health. It compared the efficacy of oral supplementation to that of topical application, but did not refer to any research into the efficacy of IV vitamin C, and it summarised that there was little evidence concerning a relationship between vitamin C and general skin ageing although there was some evidence that general good nutrition led to better skin condition. We had not seen adequate evidence that glutathione, NAC and vitamin C – alone or in combination – had, over any time period, an anti-ageing effect on the body, could improve the appearance of skin, hair or nails, or have an effect on skin pigmentation. We concluded that such claims in the ad for the Vitaglow drip had not been substantiated and were misleading. Royal Flush drip The description for the Royal Flush drip included the claims “BENEFITS – Restores Hydration – Replenishes Essential Minerals & Vitamins – Boost Your Immune System […] – Delivers Energy Boost – Detoxifies Your Body – Cleanses Vital Organs”. Claims also included that the drip combined “the benefits of Ultraviv, Megaboost and Vitaglow”, delivered “additional wellness” and was the “top choice for […] anyone that is completely worn out and exhausted.” We considered that consumers would understand from the ad that the particular formulation of the Royal Flush drip would provide the health benefits of better hydration above other methods of hydrating, improvements in the functioning of the immune system, an increase in energy and an improvement in the body’s ability to remove toxins. We considered there was nothing in the ad that indicated how long those benefits may last, and consumer expectations of the longevity of the benefits would therefore likely range from days to weeks. The ad also referred to “the benefits of Ultraviv, Megaboost and Vitaglow”. We considered consumers would therefore also understand that the drip would deliver the same health benefits as described in the web pages relating to the Ultraviv, Megaboost and Vitaglow drips, as laid out above, as associated with the particular substances in those drips which were also included in the Royal Flush drip. We considered consumers would further understand from the ad that because the Royal Flush combined the benefits of those drips, and because it delivered “additional wellness” it provided a greater overall general benefit to health than the other drips on their own. We understood the Royal Flush drip included all the substances which were used in REVIV’s other drips in various combinations: saline, vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, B12 and C, magnesium, NAC and glutathione. We had already reviewed evidence relating to the claimed benefits of certain substances included in REVIV’s other drips. However, we had not yet reviewed evidence relating to the effects of vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, B12 and C on hydration, the effects of magnesium and glutathione on immune function, the effects of glutathione on energy or the effects of vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, B12 and C and magnesium and glutathione on the removal of toxins from the body. We had not seen evidence relevant to claims that vitamins B1, B2, B3, B6, B12 and C improved the body’s ability to remove toxins (other than that reviewed above in relation to the role of those vitamins in the immune system and their effects on oxidative stress). We also had not seen evidence relating to the role of those vitamins in providing better hydration above other methods of hydrating. We had reviewed seven documents relating to the role of glutathione as an antioxidant in relation to the Vitaglow drip, which were also of some relevance to claims about immune function and the removal of toxins from the body. However, the documents provided were not adequate to support claims that IV-administered glutathione could improve the functioning of the immune system or improve the body’s ability to remove toxins. We had not seen any evidence that IV-administered glutathione increased energy levels. With regard to the role of IV-administered magnesium in immune function and the removal of toxins, we had not seen any evidence relating to the latter. We had seen a literature review relating to the role of various micronutrients, including magnesium, in immune function and an article relating to the role of various vitamins and minerals, including magnesium, in the prevention and treatment of Covid-19. The documents confirmed that those vitamins and minerals played a role in immune function, but they were not sufficient or relevant evidence that an IV drip containing those nutrients improved the functioning of the immune system in normally healthy people. As discussed above, we also had not seen adequate evidence that the Ultraviv, Megaboost and Vitaglow drips delivered any of the health benefits described in descriptions for those drips, nor had we seen evidence that the Royal Flush drip delivered a greater overall benefit than those drips on their own. We concluded we had not seen sufficient evidence to support the claims for the Royal Flush drip. Because we had not seen evidence which was adequate to support the advertised health benefits of the IV drips, or the substances in them when delivered by IV infusion, we concluded that the claims were misleading and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told REVIV UK Ltd not to make any claims, explicit or implied, that their IV drips or the substances in them could provide any health benefits, over any period of time, until such time as they held evidence relating to the use of IV drips in normally healthy humans that was adequate to support such claims. This included, for example, stated and implied claims that the drips or the substances in them could: increase energy levels and physical performance; provide quicker and more effective recovery from strenuous exercise; provide better hydration than other methods in normally healthy people; improve the body’s ability to remove toxins and combat oxidative stress; improve the functioning of the immune system; improve the appearance and health of skin, hair and nails; have an anti-ageing effect; or change skin pigmentation.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/reviv-uk-ltd-a19-562605-reviv-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Golden Tanning Salon Ltd t/a Golden Tanning Salon,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A TikTok post by Golden Tanning Salon, seen in May 2023, featured a person in a salon and a sound clip from Keeping up with the Kardashians. In response to someone saying, “I don’t watch TV”, the person lip-synched to someone saying, “Like no one cares. You don’t get an award cos you watch less TV’” Large text superimposed at the top of the video stated “‘i [sic] don’t get sunbeds because they are bad for u…’”. Smaller text at the bottom of the video stated “sunbeds have lots of benefits including, [sic] increasing vitamin D, fights inflam…more”. Clicking on “more” brought up the additional text “[…]mation, rebuilds collagen & helps with blood circulation whilest [sic] also getting that golden tan […]”.",The ASA challenged whether linking claims for health benefits with the use of sunbeds was: 1. misleading; and 2. irresponsible. 3. The ASA also challenged whether the ad was appropriately targeted.,"1. & 2. Golden Tanning Salon Ltd said while they understood that the NHS advised against sunbed use, they had joined an industry body and had taken information about vitamin D from their website. They had also taken information from one of their suppliers. They provided links to that information. They apologised if the ad breached the Advertising Code and said they would not include any similar information in their future ads. 3. Regarding the targeting of the ad, they said they had a strict no under-18s policy in their salons, as directed by law. They stated they would never intentionally advertise to those who were not legally allowed to use sunbeds. The post in question was not targeted to a specific audience. They said they now understood that the TikTok algorithm prevented them from controlling the audience of their posts. They confirmed the issues would not be repeated again in their future ads and social media. TikTok said the ad was posted by Golden Tanning Salon to promote their own brand. It was therefore covered by TikTok’s Community Guidelines relating to organic content, which prohibited ""inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent"". TikTok also stated that at the time the content was posted, users were able to target their organic posts to age groups over 18 by engaging the 'Audience Controls' toggle.","1. Upheld The ASA considered consumers would interpret the ad to mean that there were health benefits to be gained from using sunbeds, which included increasing vitamin D, fighting inflammation, rebuilding collagen and helping with blood circulation. For health-related claims, we expected Golden Tanning Salon to hold a high level of evidence, consisting of studies and trials that showed these benefits were obtained by humans from sunbeds. However, Golden Tanning Salon did not provide us with such evidence. We also took into account that NHS advice on the use of sunbeds was cautious. The advice warned that the ultraviolet (UV) rays given out by sunbeds increased the risk of developing skin cancer and that many sunbeds gave out greater doses of UV rays than midday tropical sun. Given the absence of convincing evidence from Golden Tanning Salon, and the caution urged by the advice from the NHS, we considered the claims that sunbeds provided health benefits were not substantiated. Whilst we welcomed Golden Tanning Salon’s confirmation that they would not use similar claims in future, we concluded that the ad breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 2. Upheld The ad included a sound clip from Keeping up with the Kardashians, which we understood was a popular TikTok meme used to poke fun at criticism. We considered the use of the clip alongside the text “‘i [sic] don’t get sunbeds because they are bad for u…’” would be understood as mocking those who raised concerns about the use of sunbeds, and encouraging people to disregard advice to be cautious about using them. As explained above, NHS advice was cautious about the use of sunbeds. There were potentially serious consequences for people who used them because they believed there would be health benefits. In that context, and because the ad mocked those who raised concerns about the potential consequences of sunbed use and encouraged people to disregard those concerns, we concluded that, as well as not being substantiated, the ad was irresponsible. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Responsible advertising). 3. Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications for cosmetic interventions must not be directed at those under 18 years of age through the selection of media or context in which they appear. ‘Cosmetic interventions’ meant any intervention, procedure or treatment carried out with the primary objective of changing an aspect of a consumer’s physical appearance. That included surgical and non-surgical interventions, both invasive and non-invasive. The ad was posted organically by Golden Tanning Salon. We noted that organic posts on TikTok could be targeted away from under-18s by utilising the ‘Audience controls’ toggle, but the advertiser had not done so. They also did not provide any data regarding the demographics of individuals who had seen the ads or a demographic breakdown of their followers on TikTok. We also took into account the mechanics of TikTok and how content was shared with its users. We understood that TikTok’s “For You” page was the first one users saw after opening the app and was the main way in which its users engaged with content. We further understood that this page was algorithmically driven, and therefore users would see content from accounts they did not follow but was likely to be of interest to them. Because of the way organic content was disseminated on TikTok via the “For You” page, ads for cosmetic interventions, such as tanning beds, should have been appropriately restricted from viewing by under-18s. However, Golden Tanning Salon had not used the targeting tools available to them to do so. As such, we considered that insufficient care had been taken to ensure that the ad was not directed at people under 18, and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.25 (Cosmetic interventions).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Golden Tanning Salon Ltd to ensure their ads did not misleadingly and irresponsibly claim or imply that health benefits were obtained from sunbeds unless they held adequate evidence for this. We also told them not to irresponsibly encourage people to disregard advice to not use sunbeds, and to ensure that their ads were appropriately targeted.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/golden-tanning-salon-ltd-a23-1198240-golden-tanning-salon.html
ASA Ruling on Person(s) unknown,"Summary of Council decision: Four issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A TikTok post from House of Beauty, seen in May 2023, featured a video of the inside of a tanning booth, with superimposed text. The heading “Benefits of Sunbeds” was followed by the text “- They give you a natural tan - They provide your body with vitamin D - They help with skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis - They enable you to have some time to yourself - They make you look and feel better in general!!”. Small text at the bottom stated “Who doesnt [sic] love a sunbed anyway”.","The ASA challenged whether the: 1. claims that sunbeds provided the body with vitamin D, helped eczema and helped people “feel better in general” were misleading; 2. ad discouraged essential treatment for a condition for which medical supervision should be sought, namely psoriasis; and 3. ad was irresponsible because it linked claims for health benefits with the use of sunbeds and suggested they were a good way to “have some time to yourself”. 4. The ASA also challenged whether the ad was appropriately targeted.","1., 2., 3. & 4. Person(s) unknown t/a houseofbeautykent did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. TikTok said the post had been deleted by the advertiser and therefore no longer appeared on the platform. The ad was covered by TikTok’s Community Guidelines relating to organic content, which prohibited ""inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent"". TikTok also stated that at the time the content was posted, users were able to target their organic posts to age groups over 18 years by engaging the 'Audience Controls' toggle.","We were concerned by Person(s) unknown t/a houseofbeautykent’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We were also concerned by their failure to provide their full name and geographical business address, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7.1 (Compliance). We reminded them of their responsibilities to provide this information to the ASA or CAP without delay if requested and to respond promptly to our enquiries, and told them to do so in future. 1. Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would interpret the ad to mean that there were health benefits to be gained from using sunbeds, which included increasing vitamin D, helping with skin conditions such as eczema, and enhancing mood. For health-related claims, we expected houseofbeautykent to hold a high level of evidence, consisting of studies and trials which showed these benefits were obtained by humans from sunbeds. However, houseofbeautykent did not provide us with such evidence. We also took into account that NHS advice on the use of sunbeds was cautious. The advice warned that the ultraviolet (UV) rays given out by sunbeds increased the risk of developing skin cancer and that many sunbeds gave out greater doses of UV rays than midday tropical sun. Given the absence of convincing evidence from houseofbeautykent, and the caution urged by the advice from the NHS, we considered the claims that sunbeds provided health benefits were not substantiated. We therefore concluded that the ad breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketers must not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. For example, they must not offer specific advice on, diagnosis of or treatment for such conditions unless that advice, diagnosis or treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified health professional. The ad referred to psoriasis, which was a condition for which medical supervision should be sought, and therefore advice, diagnosis or treatment must be conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. We had not seen evidence to show that houseofbeautykent’s tanning services were provided under the supervision of a suitably qualified health professional. We considered that in the absence of such a professional, the ad therefore discouraged essential medical treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. The ad therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.2 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 3. Upheld As explained above, NHS advice was cautious about the use of sunbeds. There were potentially serious consequences for people who used them because they believed there would be health benefits. In that context, we concluded that as well as not being substantiated, the claims that sunbeds provided health benefits, and that using sunbeds was a good way to “have some time to yourself”, were irresponsible. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Responsible advertising). 4. Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications for cosmetic interventions must not be directed at those under 18 years of age through the selection of media or context in which they appear. ‘Cosmetic interventions’ meant any intervention, procedure or treatment carried out with the primary objective of changing an aspect of a consumer’s physical appearance. That included surgical and non-surgical interventions, both invasive and non-invasive. The ad was posted organically by houseofbeautykent. We noted that organic posts on TikTok could be targeted away from under-18s by utilising the ‘Audience controls’ toggle, but had not received any evidence that the advertiser had done so. They also did not provide any data regarding the demographics of individuals who had seen the ads or a demographic breakdown of their followers on TikTok. We also took into account the mechanics of TikTok and how content was shared with its users. We understood that TikTok’s “For You” page was the first one users saw after opening the app and the main way in which its users engaged with content. We further understood that this page was algorithmically driven, and therefore users would see content from accounts they did not follow but was likely to be of interest to them. Because of the way organic content was disseminated on TikTok via the “For You” page, ads for cosmetic interventions, such as tanning beds, should have been appropriately restricted from viewing by under-18s. However, houseofbeautykent had not provided evidence that they had used the targeting tools available to them to do so. As such, we considered that insufficient care had been taken to ensure that the ad was not directed at people under 18, and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.25 (Cosmetic interventions).",The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told Person(s) unknown t/a houseofbeautykent to ensure their ads did not misleadingly and irresponsibly claim or imply that health benefits were obtained from sunbeds unless they held adequate evidence. We also told them to ensure they did not discourage essential treatment for which medical supervision should be sought and that their ads were appropriately targeted. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/person-s--unknown-a23-1198241-person-s--unknown.html
ASA Ruling on Virgin Media Ltd t/a Virgin Media,,"A website for Virgin Media, www.virginmedia.com, seen on 3 July 2023, featured headline text that stated “Our WiFi Guarantee”. Smaller text underneath stated “Get the fastest WiFi Guarantee of any major provider”. A box immediately underneath invited users to input their postcode and click to “Check availability”. Further text on the page stated “Virgin Fibre areas only. WiFi Guarantee available with M50 broadband or faster. £8p/m extra or included with Gig1 or Volt. At least 30Mbps download speeds in every room or £100 one-off credit. Up to 3 WiFi Pods if needed. Exclusions & legal stuff apply. Fastest WiFi guarantee of major UK ISPs. See virginmedia.com/legal/wifi.” Under the heading “Our WiFi guarantee with WiFi Max”, text stated “With WiFi Max, we want to make sure you’ll enjoy download speeds of at least 30Mbps in every room – if you don’t, we’ll send you one of our signal boosting mesh WiFi Pods. If that doesn’t do the job, we’ll send you up to a total of 3. We’re so confident in this technology that we’ve launched our WiFi guarantee. This means if you don’t get download speeds of at least 30Mbps in every room, and our WiFi Pods don’t do the trick, we’ll pop £100 credit onto your next bill”.",Vodafone Ltd challenged whether the claim “Get the fastest WiFi Guarantee of any major provider” was misleading and could be substantiated.,"Virgin Media Ltd said that a large number of major broadband providers promoted WiFi guarantees to consumers. These guarantees provided reassurance to customers that a certain minimum level of WiFi service would be received in each room of the customer’s home, and if that minimum level was not met they would receive an entitlement. Their WiFi Guarantee promised customers at least 30Mbps download speeds in every room, backed up by up to 3 mesh WiFi pods (which provided a signal boost if required), and if the minimum speed was still not met they would receive a one-off £100 credit. This minimum speed threshold was three times that of Vodafone’s WiFi guarantee, and the highest of any major provider, therefore making it “the fastest WiFi Guarantee of any major provider”. Qualifying text underneath the claim explained the terms of their guarantee and included a link to verify the comparison. They were not making a broad performance claim that they provided the fastest WiFi. They believed that consumers would have read the claim “Get the fastest WiFi Guarantee of any major provider” as they intended, and would not have ignored the reference to “guarantee” in the claim, nor the qualifying explanation about the scope of the guarantee, and therefore would not have been misled. The details provided on the verification page were extensive and allowed the consumer to understand fully the scope of Virgin Media and their competitors’ guarantees.","Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim “Get the fastest WiFi Guarantee of any major provider” to mean that Virgin Media guaranteed they offered the fastest WiFi service of any major broadband provider. Virgin Media had explained that rather than being a claim that they offered the fastest WiFi, the claim related to their “Wifi Guarantee”, which meant that customers with WiFi Max would be sent up to three signal boosting WiFi pods if they did not obtain download speeds of at least 30 Mbps in every room. If that was unsuccessful, they would receive a one off credit of £100. Other broadband providers also offered similar Wifi guarantees, but they related to speeds of less than 30 Mbps. Virgin Media therefore considered the claim was not misleading. On that basis, they did not provide comparative evidence about the speed of their WiFi and that of the other major providers. We considered that while some consumers may have been aware of WiFi guarantees, many would not. The difference between guaranteeing the highest speed and offering a guarantee which promised action by the advertiser if a minimum speed was not met was a subtle one and required clear explanation to ensure that consumers were not misled about what was being offered. We did not consider that the headline claim ""Get the fastest WiFi Guarantee of any major provider” would have been understood as Virgin Media intended by consumers, and that, as set out above, a significant proportion would understand it to mean that Virgin Media guaranteed they offered the fastest WiFi service of any major broadband provider. We acknowledged that the ad included further information about the WiFi guarantee which sought to provide more detail on what they were guaranteeing and how the guarantee worked. However, we considered that this was insufficient to override the impression from the claim that Virgin Media offered the fastest WiFi of the major providers. We also noted that a box immediately underneath the headline claim “Get the fastest WiFi Guarantee of any major provider” at the top of the page invited users to input their postcode and click to “Check availability”, and that consumers were therefore encouraged to take action on the basis of the claim, notwithstanding that qualifying information appeared underneath. We considered that the headline claim should have been more clearly worded and immediately qualified to ensure that consumers understood the nature of the guarantee. Therefore, because the claim had not been substantiated as it would be understood by consumers, we concluded that the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading Advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Virgin Media Ltd to ensure that they did not imply that they guaranteed the fastest WiFi service of all major broadband providers if that was not the case.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/virgin-media-ltd-a23-1206573-virgin-media-ltd.html

The ASA considered that the claim that “Air France is committed to protecting the environment” and the claim that they enabled people to “travel better and sustainably” would be understood by consumers to mean that Air France offered a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to travel by air. We therefore expected to see a high level of evidence which demonstrated how Air France were protecting the environment and making aviation sustainable. We understood that air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. We also understood that there were currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry that would adequately substantiate absolute green claims, such as that Air France were “committed to protecting the environment” and helped people “travel better and sustainably”, as we considered consumers would interpret them in this context.In the absence of any evidence demonstrating that Air France were protecting the environment and making aviation sustainable, we concluded that the claims gave consumers a misleading impression of the impact that travelling with Air France would have on the environment.

ASA Ruling on Deutsche Lufthansa AG t/a Lufthansa,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of enforcement work on climate change and the environment. The ad was identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Google ad for Lufthansa, seen in July 2023, stated “Fly now with Lufthansa […] Book your ticket directly with Lufthansa and explore destinations around the world […] Fly more sustainably”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad gave a misleading impression of the advertiser’s environmental impact.,"Deutsche Lufthansa AG t/a Lufthansa said that the ad had been created by the Google Callouts service from Google Ads, which highlighted options that customers could make use of in addition to a general flight booking. They said the callout “Fly more sustainably” was a reference to their “Green Fares” option, which passengers could select on European flights. They said that the “Green Fares” option would reduce 20% of flight-related CO2 emissions by using sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and offsetting the remaining 80% of the CO2 emissions by an equivalent contribution to high-quality climate protection projects. Lufthansa said that 20/80 combination of reduction and offsetting was a new and unique option which they thought was worth informing potential customers about, to support SAF and high-quality climate protection projects. They believed that the claims seen in the ad were admissible comparative claims, in line with the CAP Code, because the fare option offering a combination of CO2 reduction and offsetting differed from the general fare options offered by them and their competitors. Lufthansa said that the technical limits of Google Callouts meant that only very limited information could be provided in such an ad. They believed that an average consumer and Google user was aware of that limitation, and did not expect fully-fledged substantiation to appear in a Callout in a search result, but would instead follow the link provided by the search result to get further information. Lufthansa said that they had instructed their agency to remove the sentence “Fly more sustainably” from their Google Callouts going forward.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that the basis of environmental claims must be clear. Unqualified claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. Comparative claims could be justified if the basis of the comparison was clear. The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claim that people could “Fly more sustainably” with Lufthansa to mean that they offered a way to travel by air that had a lower environmental impact than alternative airlines. The ad did not clarify how the claim “Fly more sustainably” worked in practice, and the basis of the claim was likely to be material information which consumers would need in order to make an informed decision. While we noted that flying with the Green Fares option used “sustainable aviation fuel” as part of the fuel mix for that flight and made contributions to climate protection projects, and that this might decrease some of the negative environmental impact of flying with Lufthansa, we considered that the basis for the claim ""Fly more sustainably” had not been made clear in the ad. Although we accepted that space in a search result ad was limited, we did not consider that meant that material information of such relevance could be omitted. While we welcomed Lufthansa’s decision to remove the sentence “Fly more sustainably” from future ads, we therefore concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of Lufthansa’s environmental impact, and that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), and 11.1 and 11.3 (Environmental claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about.

The ASA considered that the claims that Etihad allowed consumers to explore the world with “Total Peace Of Mind”, alongside the phrase “Environmental Advocacy”, would be understood by consumers to mean that Etihad actively worked to protect the environment and, consequently, consumers could use their services with “Total Peace Of Mind” with regard to the environmental impact of doing so. We therefore expected to see a high level of evidence, which showed how they offered consumers total peace of mind about the environmental impact of using their service. We understood that air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. We also understood that there were currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry that would adequately substantiate absolute green claims, such as that Etihad were providing consumers with “Total Peace Of Mind” when travelling by air, and engaging in “Environmental Advocacy”, as we considered consumers would interpret them in this context.

ASA Ruling on GetAgent Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A website for GetAgent, www.getagent.co.uk, an estate agent referral site, seen on 21 June 2023. The homepage stated “Find the best Estate Agent for you. See which agents will do the best job of selling your home, based on past performance”. Text underneath stated “Impartial recommendations”. Text further down the page stated “Independent: The agents listed are based on performance data from the Land Registry. Agents don’t pay to appear”. Another web page included a shortlist of recommended agents after inputting an address. The first three listed agents included information on the average sale time; the asking price change; the fee quote; and the services the agency offered. Underneath each listing, a green box stated “Request Free Valuation”. The bottom three listings on the shortlist included information about the average sales time, the number of properties listed in the last six months and the asking price change. It stated no data was available for the fee quote or services offered by those agents, and the “Request Free Valuation” button was also not available. An orange box alongside the text “Most Experienced” appeared across one of the listings.",RE/MAX Property estate agents challenged whether the: 1. top three search results on the shortlisted agents page were obviously identifiable as marketing communications; and 2. claims “impartial recommendations” and “agents don’t pay to appear” were misleading and could be substantiated.,"1. & 2. GetAgent Ltd said they compiled data from house selling websites and cross-referenced it with data from the Land Registry to assess any given estate agent’s performance. They said their system recommended six estate agents near to where the property was being sold and that these recommendations were based on a number of factors, including the average time it took to sell a property and the percentage of the asking price received. GetAgent said the shortlist was hyper-localised and varied depending on the performance data. They said the shortlist was comprised of a mix of estate agents who were signed up with GetAgent and estate agents who were not. They highlighted that the default view of the shortlist was in alphabetical order and whether GetAgent were able to facilitate the homeowner’s valuation request. The order was not indicative of performance and banners were used to highlight top performers in their respective categories such as “most experienced”, which the complainant was described as. They explained that their impartial recommendations were based on those performance banners. Furthermore, they confirmed that agents could not pay for the banners to appear in their listing and, consequently, they believed the shortlist should be regarded as an organic search listing. GetAgent said that the shortlist could be ordered in any way a homeowner preferred, such as listing the agents that had listed the most properties. They re-iterated that the shortlist showed the top six performing agents regardless of whether they were registered with GetAgent. In cases where an agent was not registered with GetAgent, the “request a valuation” button was not present because they were not able to make the introduction. They said, due to the data available, each shortlist would differ and that, in certain cases, no estate agents registered with GetAgent would appear in the shortlist. They provided an example of an estate agent who was registered with GetAgent and had not appeared on a particular shortlist, but sold homes in a similar area. They said that the website allowed homeowners to add any estate agent they wanted in order to compare them to others on the shortlist; however, they could not request a valuation from that agent. GetAgent believed that this example demonstrated their impartial recommendations and substantiated the claim “agents don’t pay to appear”.","1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. We understood that the listings of agents who were signed up with GetAgent would appear with the ‘Request Free Valuation’ button and that, as default, the shortlist was ordered according to whether GetAgent were able to facilitate the homeowner’s valuation request; namely, whether they were signed up to the service. Therefore, agents who were signed up to GetAgent were listed in alphabetical order, followed by those not signed up to the service and featured less information than the other agents. Estate agents registered with GetAgent were required to pay a fee based on the final selling price of the property for every successful referral arranged by GetAgent. Because GetAgent received a fee in those cases, we considered the listings in the ad for those agents registered with GetAgent were marketing communications. We acknowledged that consumers could order the shortlist in any way they wished, and that, if the default order was changed, agents signed up with GetAgent would not necessarily appear at the top of the search listings. However, as GetAgent could only facilitate the homeowner’s valuation request with those agents, and GetAgent received a fee for every successful referral, we considered these listings were still marketing communications, even if they were no longer appearing in a preferential position. We then considered whether these results were obviously identifiable as marketing communications and whether it made clear its commercial intent. We acknowledged that the search listings of agents who were not signed up with GetAgent featured neither the “Request Free Valuation” button, nor data detailing the fee quota or services offered by the agent. However, we did not consider the absence of certain information in the listing made it clear to consumers that GetAgent would receive a percentage of every successful sale. Due to the absence of any prominent identifiers, we considered the ad did not make clear upfront its commercial intent and concluded it was not obviously identifiable as a marketing communication. The ad therefore breached the Code. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications). 2. Upheld The ad stated “impartial recommendations” and “agents don’t pay to appear”. We considered consumers would understand that GetAgent was an independent service that allowed consumers to sell their home by inputting a particular address and information about the property including the number of bedrooms and its estimated worth. We further considered consumers would expect that GetAgent would then recommend estate agents, personalised to information inputted by consumers and based on objective data, and that agents could not pay to appear in a preferential position on a particular shortlist. We also considered consumers would infer that the listings were ordered in terms of an agent’s suitability for the sale of their specific property, and that the order was representative of GetAgent’s impartial recommendations, along with the additional banner which highlighted an agent as “most experienced”. Additionally, certain listings contained additional information, such as the fees and other services offered, and also included a “Request Free Valuation” button, which consumers would understand allowed them to receive more detail on the sale of their property directly from those specific estate agents. Within the context of the claims, we considered consumers would interpret the ‘default’ view of the shortlist as displaying the overall best estate agent for that particular property at the top of the shortlist, with the least appropriate agent being listed at the bottom. We acknowledged that it was not possible for agents to pay for the “most experienced” banner and that, after receiving the shortlist in the default order, the results could be ordered by consumers in a number of different ways; for example, in order of those who had listed the most properties within a six-month period. However, as referenced above, GetAgent received a commission from every successful property sale generated through the website, and consequently, we considered those agents had paid to appear ahead of agents who were not signed up with GetAgent in a preferential position on the default shortlist. Because of that, we considered that the default order of the search results was not based on objective data or ordered from most to least suitable agent, as consumers would have expected. We therefore considered the mechanics behind the way in which the search listings appeared in the ad were insufficient to substantiate the claims “agents don’t pay to appear” and “impartial recommendations”. Furthermore, the listings for agents who were signed up with GetAgent appeared with the “Request Free Valuation” button and contained additional data, such as fee quota and services offered by the agent. We therefore considered consumers would have to independently visit the website of those agents not signed up with GetAgent in order to contact them and understand more about them. As such, we considered consumers were less likely to contact one of those agents. Because GetAgent only allowed consumers to directly contact those agents who had paid a fee, and only published a full data set for those agents, we further considered that the search listings in the ad did not represent “impartial recommendations”. We therefore concluded that the claims “impartial recommendations” and “agents don’t pay to appear” were misleading and could not be substantiated. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told GetAgent Ltd to ensure that their future ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications and that the commercial intent was made clear. We also told them to not to claim that they offered impartial recommendations or that agents did not pay to appear if that was not the case.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/getagent-ltd-a23-1202342-getagent-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Polyverse Inc,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An in-game mobile app ad for the artificial intelligence (AI) photo editor app AI Mirror, seen on 8 September 2023 in the mobile app game Pocket Champs, featured an image of a real woman with an anime/manga style face who was bent forward and wore small, tight shorts that were being pulled up past her hips to expose the bottom part of her buttocks. Superimposed text stated “Try this Ai effect”.","The complainant, who believed the ad was overly sexualised and objectified women, challenged whether the ad: 1. was harmful, offensive and irresponsible; and 2. had been irresponsibly targeted.","Polyverse Inc t/a AI Mirror apologised for the ad and said that it had been uploaded independently by an agency. They had promptly requested the ad’s removal after they became aware of it. They had not deliberately placed the ad in Pocket Champs; its placement had occurred due to their ad network’s algorithm. They said they were committed to enhancing their oversight of the external agencies they employ. Madbox, the publisher of Pocket Champs, said that their in-app ads were served programmatically via third-party networks. As a result, because of the high volume of ads shown through their apps, they said direct human control could only occur after the ads were served and in a limited manner. They added they took the advertising rules and ethical conduct seriously and had activated the controls provided by their ad networks to regulate the ads shown in their apps. In light of the complaint, they said they had taken action to prevent a similar situation happening again. AppLovin Corporation, the ad network that served the ad, said that after being informed of the complaint they had paused ads for the AI Mirror app being served through their network. They said their terms of use agreement and other policies included content restrictions, and that advertisers had to agree to comply with those polices and all applicable laws and regulations. They said they had reminded Polyverse of these ad content policies and the consequences for breaking them, and that they would now require Polyverse to seek pre-approval before uploading ads to be served via Applovin’s network.","1. & 2. Upheld The ASA considered the woman was presented in a sexualised manner, and that by portraying her in that way, where her image was intended to be edited and altered as part of the app, the ad objectified her. We further considered the ad included a harmful stereotype by presenting the woman as a sexual object with the purpose of titillating viewers. For those reasons we concluded the ad was irresponsible and likely to cause both serious and widespread offence, and had been irresponsibly targeted, because it was not suitable to be published in any game. We concluded the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on South African Foods Ltd t/a Candy Store 4 You,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A TikTok post on Saira Hayati’s account @sairahayati, seen on 11 June 2023, featured the claims “You need to alkaline your body!! Reduce inflammation it makes you sick!!!”, “Sea Salt, it alkalines [sic] your body […] Celtic Sea Salt alkalines your body, it makes you function to optimal level. It will allow you to increase many many things. Alkalining your body is so important, because the more acidic it is, the more open it is to disorders and diseases”, “even one little grain of this stuff is packed with minerals your body needs”, “It has 92 minerals in it”, “It helps balance your sugar level; it eliminates mucus build up; it improves your brain function; and it balances your electrolytes, which is so important, like your sodium, and your […] magnesium, potassium, all of those kind [sic] of stuff. It’s packed with magnesium as well”, and “it actually doesn’t raise your blood pressure […] This stuff, it doesn’t raise your blood pressure, because I’ve tried it”.","The complainant challenged whether the ad made: 1. general and specific health claims that were in breach of the Code; 2. nutrition claims that was in breach of the Code; and 3. claims to prevent, treat or cure human disease, which were prohibited by the Code.","South African Foods Ltd t/a Candy Store 4 You said they were not affiliated with Saira Hayati and that they had no editorial control over the post. They said she had bought the product independently and created the video herself. Saira Hayati said the claims were taken from a search engine, various websites and a video from a well-known nutritionist who had also tested Celtic Sea Salt. Ms Hayati said the product did help to “alkaline” the body and that the only error in the ad was the claim the product contained 92 minerals, as it only contained 82. Ms Hayati said she had corrected that claim in the comments section of the post. Ms Hayati provided a screenshot that showed she would receive commission on the product if she sold it via the TikTok Shop using the link provided in the post. TikTok said it violated their Branded Content Policy and they had removed it from their platform.","1. Upheld The ASA first assessed whether the post was an ad for the purposes of the Code. We understood that Saira Hayati was affiliated with South African Foods Ltd t/a Candy Store 4 You via the TikTok Shop. We also understood the video contained a link where consumers could buy Celtic Sea Salt via the TikTok Shop and that Ms Hayati received commission on the product each time it was purchased using the link provided in the post. Because that link was directly connected to the supply of goods, and Ms Hayati received a commission from Candy Store 4 You for every product sold, the post was an ad for the purposes of the Code. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health, and required that only health claims authorised on the applicable register, which in this case was the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register), were permitted in marketing communications for foods. The Code also required that general health claims, which were claims that referred to the general benefits of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health-related well-being, must be accompanied by a specific authorised health claim. We next assessed which claims were specific health claims and which, therefore, must be authorised on the GB Register. We considered the claims “this is Celtic Sea Salt, it alkalines your body”, “it helps balance your sugar level”, “it improves brain function” and “it balances your electrolytes” would be understood by consumers to mean that Celtic Sea Salt could make the body more alkaline, balance sugar levels in the body, support cognitive health and balance electrolytes. We considered the claim “it actually doesn’t raise your blood pressure” was also a specific health claim, since it implied that consuming other, similar products would cause an increase in blood pressure, whereas Celtic Sea Salt’s product would have the beneficial health effect of not doing so. We considered those claims were therefore specific health claims for the purposes of the Code. However, we had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that those claims were authorised on the GB Register. We then assessed which claims were general health claims, which therefore must be accompanied by an authorised specific health claim on the GB Register. We considered the claim “it makes you function to an optimal level” would be understood as a reference to the general benefit of Celtic Sea Salt for overall good health. We considered it was therefore a general health claim for the purposes of the Code and would only be acceptable if accompanied by a specific authorised health claim. However, the claim had not been accompanied by a relevant, authorised specific health claim. Because we had not seen any evidence that the specific health claims in the ad were authorised on the GB Register, and the ad made a general health claim that was not accompanied by an authorised specific health claim, we concluded it had breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 and 15.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that only nutrition claims authorised on the GB Register were permitted in marketing communications. The Code defined a nutrition claim as any claim which stated, suggested or implied that a food had particular beneficial nutritional properties due to the amount of calories, nutrients or other substances it contained, did not contain, or contained in reduced or increased proportions. We considered the claims “it has 92 minerals in it” and “packed with minerals” would be understood by consumers to mean that the product had the particular beneficial nutritional property of containing a range of minerals. We considered the claims were therefore nutrition claims for the purposes of the Code. However, the generalised claim “contains minerals” was not authorised on the GB Register. We considered the claim “packed with magnesium” would be understood as a “high in magnesium” claim, and was therefore also a nutrition claim for the purposes of the Code. However, we had not seen any evidence that the product complied with the conditions of use for that claim. For those reasons, we concluded the ad had breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). 3. Upheld The CAP Code stated that claims which stated or implied a food could prevent, treat or cure human disease were prohibited for foods. The ad made the claims “alkalining your body is so important, because the more acidic it is, the more open it is to disorders and diseases”, “eliminates mucus build up” and “reduce inflammation”. We considered consumers would understand those to be claims that the product could prevent human disease and treat inflammation, respectively. The ad also made the claim the product could “eliminate mucus build up”. We understood mucus build up was typically experienced as a symptom of illnesses such as a cold or flu. The claim therefore implied Celtic Sea Salt could resolve a symptom of illness and as such treat human disease. Because those were claims to prevent, treat or cure human disease, we concluded they breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told South African Foods Ltd t/a Candy Store 4 You, and Saira Hayati, to ensure any specific health claims or nutrition claims made in their future advertising were authorised on the GB Register and complied with the conditions of use for those claims. Also, any general health claims needed to be accompanied by a relevant authorised specific health claim. We also told them not to claim or imply a food or food supplement could prevent, treat or cure human disease.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/south-african-foods-ltd-a23-1202159-south-african-foods-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Imiracle (HK) Ltd t/a ELFBAR,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A poster and digital billboard ad, for ELFBAR e-cigarettes, seen in London in late July and early August 2023: a. A poster on the side of a bus stated “RECYCLING FOR A GREENER FUTURE GreenAwareness” followed by the recycling symbol. Two vapes were pictured, with the text “NEW ELFBAR 600V2 IS AVAILABLE NOW”. b. The digital billboard featured the same products, text and symbol as ad (a).","The ASA received ten complaints, including from Adfree Cities and Imperial Tobacco Ltd. All the complainants, who understood that the products were single-use vapes and not widely recyclable, challenged whether the ads: 1. were misleading because they did not make clear there were only limited recycling options for the products; and 2. misled about the environmental benefit that the products offered. 3. Adfree Cities also challenged whether the ads misleadingly highlighted an environmental benefit that resulted from a legal obligation to which competing products were also subject.","1. & 2. The ads were placed by Imiracle (HK) Ltd t/a ELFBAR, the global owner of the ELFBAR brand. They authorised Green Fun Alliance Ltd (ELFBAR), the importer and one of the distributors of ELFBAR products in the UK, to respond to the ASA. ELFBAR said that research by Material Focus (a not-for-profit organisation aiming to ensure that electricals were reused and recycled), conducted in 2023, had shown that 70% of people threw away their single-use vapes because they did not know they were recyclable. The general intention of the ads was therefore to raise awareness that their vapes could be recycled and to encourage consumers to engage with recycling; the “GreenAwareness” programme was intended to communicate that. While they could continue to improve their products and increase their recycling initiatives they were reliant on consumers to actively recycle to reduce the number of products being thrown away. They considered consumers would interpret “Recycling for a greener future” to mean that they were generally encouraging the recycling of vapes, and that vaping products – including ELFBAR vapes – were capable of being recycled. They did not think consumers would understand it as an absolute claim about the environmental impact of their products, or as a claim that their products were necessarily any more environmentally friendly or offered other environmental benefits compared with their own or competitor products. The ads did not include a specific reference to their products or vaping products generally; they said the image of the products was incidental. ELFBAR did not claim to be ‘greener’ but instead as striving for a “greener future” by increasing the awareness of the recycling of vapes more generally. Improved consumer awareness would encourage consumers to seek out information about the various means of recycling their products. ELFBAR also did not believe the ads would be understood by consumers to mean that vapes were recyclable (fully or otherwise), that they could be recycled through household waste or recycling provisions, or that they were easily recyclable elsewhere or through a variety of routes. The use of the recycling symbol indicated that an object was capable of being recycled, but not that it would necessarily be accepted in all recycling collection systems (including through household waste), or that it had been recycled. However, they recognised the ads could have been more specific about how vapes could be recycled and ELFBAR’s specific recycling initiatives. They said single-use vapes could be recycled through many outlets, including but not limited to supermarkets, selected vape stores, and at locally-authorised recycling sites. They said those outlets were comprehensive and widely accessible by consumers. The options for recycling vapes were as easily accessible as those for other small electrical items in the same waste category. They said there was not a requirement that recycling options be offered in-store, and in any case ELFBAR could not offer in-store recycling options directly as an online distributor only. ELFBAR was not responsible for what recycling options were offered by third-party retailers. They did not consider there was evidence that any one recycling method was more likely to improve the recycling of vapes (when compared with all options available) and that, as well as its obligations, it was also incumbent on consumers to take action to choose from the options available to them. Notwithstanding that, they were improving accessibility to recycling through their own initiatives. At the time the ads were published, 70 UK vape shops had dedicated ELFBAR recycling bins. This was a pilot programme which formed part of their work on developing and promoting a long-term recycling solution in the UK, under the GreenAwareness and “Recycling for a greener future” banners. They expected the number of independent shops in the programme to at least double by the end of 2023. The collection process was run in partnership with a lithium-ion battery and vape recycling company that delivered the products to an appropriately certified recycling organisation in the UK. The products were disassembled and the raw materials were recycled and reused. ELFBAR was also working directly with UK retailers to deliver free in-store vape collection bins. They were committed to providing several thousand bins across the UK, with the first bins arriving in-store in October 2023. Each bin would be issued with guidance to ensure retailers were aware of their statutory obligations, along with guidance on government-recommended waste collection companies. The location of those bins would be recorded and, where appropriate, included in relevant online search facilities. ELFBAR aimed to establish a closed-loop recycling system by 2025 that was mature, dismantlable and reusable. A new dedicated research and development facility was primarily focused on improved product development, to reduce environmental impact. One of their latest products (ELFBAR 600V2) had a modular and non-soldering design meaning that batteries could be more easily separated and recycled. They said their recycling partner had confirmed the design improvements enabled the reuse of 41% of each unit. They and their partners had been able to achieve a recycling and reuse rate of more than 96% and were working towards a rate greater than 99%. They said around 90% to 95% of an ELFBAR 600V2 could be recycled, excluding the cartridge that was treated separately because of chemicals. They were not aware of any competitor products that achieved the same rate. Less than 2% of the ELFBAR products they handled ended up in landfill. Their recycling partner had also confirmed that the battery in ELFBAR 600V2 vapes was 20% smaller than in the previous generation of the vapes. They highlighted that reduction was better for the environment than reuse or recycling. Additionally, the cartridge component of the ELFBAR 600V2 was incinerated at high temperatures, with energy recovery generating electricity. They therefore considered that even if the ads were understood as a statement about the environmental impact of their products they did not mislead about the environmental benefits, because ELFBAR 600V2 had a high recycling and reuse rate. Information about how to recycle their vapes was provided on their website. A dedicated page included links to a website operated by Material Focus. That website explained why it was important to recycle vapes and included a facility to search for locations where vapes – including specifically ELFBAR vapes – could be dropped off for recycling. ELFBAR was also developing a website to provide information to consumers about their GreenAwareness programme and to allow them to search for their nearest recycling location. 3. ELFBAR acknowledged that they, and their competitors, were subject to The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Regulations 2013, which obliged vape producers to finance the take-back of vapes for recycling. They highlighted that, as required, both of their UK distributors were registered on the WEEE public register. They believed many of their competitors were non-compliant in that regard. ELFBAR said the ads highlighted their recycling responsibilities. Raising consumer awareness about recycling was not a legal obligation; they had chosen to invest resource into it. Additionally, the ads were not concerned specifically with the environmental benefits their products may or may not offer, nor did they claim directly or indirectly that their vapes were any more recyclable than any other vapes. The improved recyclability of ELFBAR’s products resulted from their product research and development, based on their own environmental commitments and initiatives. There was no legal obligation to consider the future recyclability of a product during product design and manufacture.","1. Upheld The ads featured prominent ELFBAR branding, the claims “RECYCLING FOR A GREENER FUTURE” and “GreenAwareness”, the recycling symbol, and an image of two ELFBAR 600V2 vapes which were identified as being a new product that was “AVAILABLE NOW”. That product was a single-use vape. The ASA considered the ads would be of most relevance and interest to consumers who were interested in purchasing the advertised products, many of whom would already be users of single-use vapes. The Material Focus research referenced by ELFBAR found that 73% of people who used single-use vapes threw them away. 70% threw them away because they did not know they could recycle them. We therefore considered that only a relatively small proportion of consumers who saw the ads would know that single-use vapes could be recycled. An even smaller proportion would be aware of the appropriate routes by which they must be recycled or how and where they could access them. We considered consumers would interpret the ads’ focus and emphasis on the recycling and ‘green’ messaging in that context. As such, in the absence of any information about how to recycle the products, they were likely to expect that if they purchased ELFBAR’s single-use vapes they would be able to recycle them through a wide variety of routes including through easily accessible routes such as general recycling provisions at home. Single-use (and rechargeable) vapes were classified as electrical and electronic equipment, which meant that to be responsibly disposed of they must be recycled, for both environmental and safety reasons. They could be recycled at local authority locations which catered for small electrical and electronic equipment waste, and at retail outlets which provided a drop-off service in-store. Retailers that sold less than £100,000 of electricals per annum could make provision for recycling at out of-store locations rather than providing an in-store route. We understood from Material Focus that at the time the ads were published many retailers that were legally obliged to provide in-store drop-off services were not doing so. We therefore understood that there were only limited recycling options for single-use vapes, some of which may not be easy for consumers to access. We acknowledged ELFBAR’s intention was for the ads to educate and encourage consumers to recycle, and that they would be undertaking initiatives that would increase consumers’ ability to do so. However, because consumers would understand from the ads that they would be able to recycle ELFBAR’s single-use vapes through a wide variety of routes including by easily accessible routes such as home recycling provisions, when that was not the case, we concluded the ads were misleading. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification), and 11.1 (Environmental claims). 2. Upheld As referenced above, we considered the ads focused on and emphasised recycling and environmental messages through the “RECYCLING FOR A GREENER FUTURE” and “GreenAwareness” claims. In addition to the implication that there were a wide variety of recycling routes available, including easily accessible ones, we considered, particularly in the context of the lack of consumer knowledge about the recycling of single-use vapes, that the ad also implied that ELFBAR single-use vapes were completely recyclable. We understood from information published by Material Focus that up to 80% of the materials in vapes (single-use and rechargeable) could be recycled. They clarified that this excluded energy from waste, which if included would result in a percentage in the high 90s. They said, however, that vapes were particularly challenging and expensive to recycle. ELFBAR’s newest single-use vape models included non-soldered batteries, which were easier to remove and therefore aided the recycling process. They had said that 41% of each ELFBAR 600V2 vape could be reused, and 55% could be recycled (which would include energy from waste). We accepted that the total 96% reuse and recyclability rate for individual ELFBAR 600V2 vapes that were processed by ELFBAR’s recycling partner was high, but they were not completely recyclable. We also had not seen information about the recyclability of their other single-use vapes – the ELFBAR V1 (which was still available for purchase in October 2023) and the “Cigalike”. Additionally, we considered the claim “for a greener future” was ambiguous, and without qualifying information was likely to be understood by a significant proportion of consumers as a claim that ELFBAR’s recyclable vapes had less environmental impact than other vape products on the market. ELFBAR believed their single-use vapes had a higher reuse/recyclability rate than those of their competitors, but had not provided evidence of that. Additionally, we understood that single-use vapes had a significant impact on the environment, based on their full life cycle. While the accessibility to recycling provision and the amount of recyclable material within a single-use vape was similar to that of rechargeable vapes, over the course of their full life cycle more materials were used in delivering the same amount of vape inhalations than would be delivered by a rechargeable vape. Furthermore, while single-use vapes could be recycled, Material Focus’ research had found that over five million per week were being thrown away, and as a result were taken to landfill or incinerated. That equated to 65% of the 7.7 million single-use vapes purchased per week. Because we had not seen evidence that ELFBAR’s recyclable vapes had less environmental impact than other vape products on the market, we concluded that the claim “for a greener future” was likely to mislead consumers. We considered that the inaccurate impression that the products were fully recyclable combined with the claim ""for a greener future"" exaggerated the environmental benefit of the products and was therefore likely to mislead consumers. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 11.1, 11.3 and 11.4 (Environmental claims). 3. Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications must not mislead consumers about the environmental benefit that a product offered, for example by highlighting an environmental benefit that resulted from a legal obligation if competing products were subject to that legal obligation. The WEEE Regulations required all producers of electrical and electronic equipment to finance the take-back of such equipment, which included vapes, for recycling. In the context of the ads’ ambiguously general focus on and emphasis of recycling and environmental messages, and the lack of consumer knowledge around the recycling of single-use vapes, we considered consumers would interpret the ads to mean that there was something unique about ELFBAR or its products in relation to the environmental benefits it offered in relation to recycling. That could include, for example, the provisions they made for recycling their products or the funding they put towards such provisions, or the recyclability of the products compared to similar products. We acknowledged ELFBAR’s initiatives to increase consumer awareness around the recycling of single-use vapes and to improve the recyclability of their products, and that these were not part of their obligations under WEEE. However, we had not seen evidence that ELFBAR or its products were unique in relation to its initiatives relating to recycling, and noted that ELFBAR’s competitors had the same obligations in relation to the funding of take-back for recycling as ELFBAR. We considered the ads misled regarding the environmental benefits of the product, including as discussed at points 1 and 2, as well as those that resulted from a legal obligation that competing products were subject to. We therefore concluded the ads were misleading in that regard. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 11.7 (Environmental claims).","The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of. We told Imiracle (HK) Ltd t/a ELFBAR to ensure their future ads made the basis of environmental claims clear, and did not mislead as to the environmental impact or benefit of their products.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/imiracle--hk--ltd-g23-1208624-imiracle--hk--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd t/a Alton Towers Resort,,"A website for Alton Towers Theme Park, www.altontowers.com, seen on 3 July 2023, contained a page headed “Rainy Day Guarantee”. Text below the heading stated “If the weather affects ride offering during your visit to Alton Towers Theme Park, you can return for FREE. Pre-booking a reservation ticket is essential”. Under a heading “What happens if it rains at Alton Towers?” text stated “[…] Unfortunately, wet weather conditions can disrupt our rides and attractions. In some cases, we have to close certain rides to preserve the guest experience and until the bad weather passes. We cannot predetermine ride closures, but we will provide real-time updates on the Alton Towers app. If the weather affects the ride offering during your date out at Alton Towers, you can benefit from our Rainy Day Guarantee. This means that guests with qualifying tickets can return to the theme park another day, to enjoy your favourite rides in the sunshine! Qualifying Rainy Day Guarantee tickets: Online 1 day pass, Online 2 day pass (1 day only), Short break 1 day pass, Short break 2 day pass (1 day only) […]”. Text further down the page stated “[…] 2023 Rainy Day Dates […]” followed by a list of dates in March to July. At the bottom of the page, text under a heading “Alton Towers Rainy Day Policy Terms & Conditions” stated “If you have a qualifying ticket and if weather affects the ride offering at Alton Towers Resort on the day of your visit to the Theme Park, you will be entitled to return for a FREE visit. This will need to be used within 12 months of your original visit […] Exclusions apply. To be eligible for the Rainy Day Guarantee, you must have purchased your ticket on altontowers.com or altontowersholidays.com, for a specific dated ‘1 Day Pass’ or ‘2 Day Pass’ or hold a valid Merlin Magic pass […]”.","The complainant, who was told that the Rainy Day Guarantee policy did not apply to the day of her visit to Alton Towers even though it rained most of the day and many of the rides were closed, challenged whether the ad was misleading.","Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd t/a Alton Towers Resort explained that their Rainy Day Guarantee was invoked after one hour of continuous rain. Their weather records for the day in question showed there were intermittent light rain showers over a four-hour period and one continuous heavy downpour which lasted for 27 minutes. Their ride system showed they had ‘good’ ride availability for the day in question (93%). In the interests of guest comfort, they paused four rides due to rain: Pinball Wizard from 1.19pm to 1.31pm, Galactica from 1.20pm to 2.10pm, Get Set Go Treetop Adventure from 1.20pm to 1.30pm and TH13TEEN from 1.18pm to 1.58pm. During the day some of the other rides were paused but for reasons unrelated to weather. They were routine pauses as part of their standard day-to-day operations. Three of their rides were closed for extended maintenance/rebuilding work and that was explained on their website. They explained that their Rainy Day Guarantee was declared by the Park Duty Manager on the day who monitored the weather during adverse conditions. To qualify for the Rainy Day Guarantee, as explained in the Terms and Conditions on their website, a consumer must have purchased their ticket online and directly from Alton Towers Resort. However, they accepted that as the website was currently worded, it did not specify that they activated their Rainy Day Guarantee on the basis of the amount of rain and its direct impact on ride availability. They said they were reviewing their Rainy Day Guarantee and, once finalised, they would review how that is communicated to consumers and guests on their website and other marketing channels. They also provided some weather data for the date in question.","Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claims “If the weather affects ride offering during your visit to Alton Towers Theme Park, you can return for FREE”, “If the weather affects the ride offering during your date out at Alton Towers, you can benefit from our Rainy Day Guarantee. This means that guests with qualifying tickets can return to the theme park another day” and “If you have a qualifying ticket and if weather affects the ride offering at Alton Towers Resort on the day of your visit to the Theme Park, you will be entitled to return for a FREE visit” to mean that with a qualifying ticket (as specified in the ad), if adverse weather during their visit led to closure of one or more rides for any period of time, they would be entitled to a free visit another time. We understood, however, that the Rainy Day Guarantee was only invoked after one hour of continuous rain and was declared by the Park Duty Manager on the day. We understood that on the day the complainant visited the park, there were only 27 minutes of continuous rain which affected some ride offerings, none of which were closed due to the weather for more than 40 minutes. That day was not therefore declared a “Rainy Day” under the terms of the guarantee. The weather data provided showed how much rain fell during the day and gave an indication of times but did not give precise detail about how much continuous rain there was on the date in question. Notwithstanding that, we considered that the requirement for there to be at least one hour of continuous rain for the guarantee to be invoked was a significant limitation to the guarantee that should have been made clear in the ad. We also considered that the ad omitted information regarding how a “Rainy Day” under the guarantee was declared and for how long rides needed to be out of operation for in order for the guarantee to be invoked, which we considered was material information likely to affect a consumer’s understanding of how the guarantee worked. Because the ad omitted that information, we concluded that it was misleading. We welcomed Alton Towers Resort’s assurance that they were reviewing their advertising in relation to the Rainy Day Guarantee. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification) and 3.54 (Guarantees and after-sales service).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Merlin Attractions Operations Ltd t/a Alton Towers Resort to ensure their future ads included material information about their guarantees, including any significant limitations to their guarantees.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/merlin-attractions-operations-ltd-a23-1204144-merlin-attractions-operations-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Play&Date Entertainment Zone,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An in-app ad for the game Feel Fantasy was seen on 8 September 2023 in the app Relax with Word Puzzles. The ad began with animated footage of a woman’s head and shoulders facing the camera and appearing to speak, but the sound was muffled. The word “Eroticos” was superimposed in small font in one corner of the screen while a cartoon image of a woman’s head in a small box next to the word “Install” was in the other corner. A man’s hand appeared to grab the animated woman’s throat, then a second hand moved in and both hands ripped open her blouse. The screen changed to a downward arrow and the words “SIGN UP AND PLAY”.","The complainant, who believed the ad trivialised and condoned sexual violence towards women, and who noted that it appeared in an app with a rating of “E for Everyone”, challenged whether: 1. the ad was harmful, offensive and irresponsible and 2. was targeted irresponsibly.",1. & 2. Play&Date Entertainment Zone did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"1. Upheld The ASA was concerned by Play&Date Entertainment Zone’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7. We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. It further stated that marketing communications must not contain anything that is likely to cause serious or widespread offence; that particular care must be taken to avoid causing offence on the grounds of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability or age and must not include gender stereotypes that are likely to cause harm or serious or widespread offence. The ad contained animated, but lifelike footage of a woman being grabbed by the throat and then having her blouse ripped open, all to muffled sound. The ASA considered the mood of the ad was dark and threatening and with no clear anti-violence message. We considered the ripping open of the woman’s blouse; the superimposed word “Eroticos” and the cartoon image of a woman’s head in the corner with an elaborate hair style, added a sexual dimension to the ad. We considered consumers would interpret the ad as a portrayal of sexually violent behaviour by a man towards a woman without her consent. We considered the ad sexually objectified the woman, and therefore included a gender stereotype likely to cause harm. We also considered that the gratuitous way the violence towards the woman was shown, and the invitation to “sign up and play”, trivialised and condoned sexual assault and sexual violence. We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.1, 4.4 and 4.9 (Harm and offence). 2. Upheld The ad appeared in an app with a rating of “E for Everyone”. As set out in point 1, we considered the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread offence to a general audience. Notwithstanding that we considered the ad was inappropriate for a general audience, because it was likely to be considered particularly inappropriate for children to see. We considered whether or not it had been targeted away from children to minimise the risk of them seeing it. Although we considered that the Relax with Word Puzzles app was not explicitly targeted at children or was likely to appeal particularly to them, it nevertheless had a rating of “E for Everyone” and could be downloaded without charge. We considered it was therefore likely to be used by children as well as adults. Because Play&Date Entertainment Zone had not put exclusions in place which would prevent the ad being seen in an app which could be accessed by children, we concluded that the ad breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.1 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Play&Date Entertainment to ensure future ads were prepared responsibly, were appropriately targeted and did not contain scenes which trivialised or condoned sexual assault or sexual violence and which were likely to cause serious or widespread offence.

ASA Ruling on Procter & Gamble UK t/a Always,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A TV ad for the Always Discreet Ultimate Day incontinence pad, seen on 1 July 2023, began with two women practising yoga and discussing concerns about incontinence pads. In a later scene, the two women were conversing in a changing room. One of the women said, “Don’t compromise your practice just because of a bulky pad, wear Always Discreet like me”, to which the other replied, “Will this deal with my leaks?” A close-up of a glass of water being poured over the Always Discreet pad was then shown. On-screen text stated “Waiting time 20s. 95% of 146 women agree it protects and is discreet. Always Discreet Ultimate Day Pads vs Maxi Pad from the leading brand. For verification email [email protected] ”. The second woman was then shown looking shocked and asked, “Wow, where does it go?” as the water was absorbed by the pad. The on-screen text then disappeared. The first woman then responded, “Who cares? It protects, and it’s so much thinner” as two incontinence pads appeared in comparison on screen. The incontinence pad labelled “Leading Brand” appeared thicker than the incontinence pad labelled “Always Discreet”.","Essity UK Ltd, who believed that the ad made comparative claims regarding the performance of the advertised product with their brand of incontinence products, challenged whether the: 1. basis of comparison was misleading because it did not compare the Always Discreet pad with the most appropriate product from the leading brand; and 2. placement of the on-screen text misleadingly implied 95% of women surveyed preferred the Always Discreet pad to the maxi pad from the leading brand.","1. Procter & Gamble UK t/a Always explained that traditional incontinence pads were based on traditional soft fibre superabsorber technology, but that the Always Discreet pad was made using multi-layer core technology which enabled highly absorbent pads to be thinner than the traditional counterparts. Because of that, they believed it was fair to compare their product to the Tena Discreet Maxi pads and highlight the thinness of the Always Discreet pad in comparison. They said that the Always Discreet Ultimate Day pads offered the highest level of protection as part of their adult incontinence day pad range, and they had ranked it as having six “drops” on their absorbency scale. They explained they only indicated six “drops” on products when they were satisfied that it dealt with heavy leaks. They highlighted that, at the time the ad was aired, the competitor Tena Discreet Maxi pads were rated as five and a half “drops” on Tena’s absorbency scale. As such, they considered that consumers who were considering the purchase of the Always Discreet pads would compare them to the Tena Discreet Maxi pads, because they had both been rated as having a similar absorbency. They asserted that consumer choice was driven by the number of drops listed on the packaging, among other factors, rather than a product’s specific absorbency in grams. They also stated that Tena had adjusted the droplet allocation for the Tena Discreet Maxi product from 5.5 to 7 droplets since the broadcast of the ad. They believed that demonstrated manufacturers were free to affix the number of droplets to packs as they saw fit, and that the number of droplets a product had was not linked to a fixed capacity of absorption. They also stated that, unlike menstrual pads, that the number of droplets on adult incontinence pads were not standardised or regulated at an industry association level. They said that absorption was not the only important factor in determining the protection offered by an incontinence pad. They also believed that the speed at which the liquid was absorbed by the pad, the capacity for the surface of the pad to stay dry, and whether the pad contained barriers to avoid leaks, contributed to the level of protection. In addition, alongside the protection of the pad, they stated that consumer choice was driven by the comfort of the product, its ability to prevent malodours, and its discretion. As such, they considered that focusing on the capacity of absorption between the two products as the sole basis for comparison was too narrow and did not align with a consumer’s perception of the product. Always disagreed with the methodology used in relation to evidence provided by Essity as part of their complaint, which evaluated the absorbency of both incontinence pads featured in the ad. They stated that the methodology was intended to test the theoretical capacity for absorption and did not reflect how much a product could absorb in practice. They also re-iterated the consumer relevance of measuring absorbency using that method; they asserted that consumers had no understanding of the theoretical capacity of a pad, and instead, chose their preferred product from the droplets on the pack which represented the absorption capacity. Furthermore, they stated that the results from the test reflected that the two products had a similar absorbency level. They explained that 200g of urine loss per 24 hours was classified as severe incontinence. As such, according to the study shared by Essity, both products were suitable to deal with severe incontinence because they both absorbed over 200g in test conditions. They therefore believed that demonstrated the product met the same need for consumers. In addition, Always believed that the Tena Discreet Extra pad, an incontinence pad which Tena considered to be a more suitable product for comparison but was not featured in the ad, did not meet the same consumer need as the Always Discreet pad. They evidenced that point with an image of a side-by-side comparison of the two pads and commented that the Always pad was longer and thinner, and therefore not intended to cover the same consumer need. They highlighted that they did not refer to absorbency during the comparison in the ad. They further detailed that the side-by-side comparison in the ad did not show the volume of liquid that the products could absorb, neither did it demonstrate the dryness of the pads. In addition, they believed that the depiction of the women undertaking yoga in the ad was a fair representation of the product’s use. They provided a survey of 16 women who suffered from adult incontinence and tested both pads during a yoga class. The women surveyed did not report any issues with absorbency when wearing the Always pad and rated it more favourably than the Tena pad. As such, Always concluded that the ad did not compare the absorbency of the Always Discreet pad with the Tena Maxi pad, but rather, that it was more discreet and presented its capability of meeting the same consumer need with a thinner sanitary product. Clearcast were confident that the most appropriate product had been chosen for the comparison shown in the ad. They stated that, for the comparison to be fair, the competitor product needed to offer a similar performance to the Always Discreet Ultimate Day incontinence pad. They further explained that the competitor product shown, the Tena Discreet Maxi incontinence pad, was rated as having the highest absorbency in Tena’s range, excluding pads intended for night-time use. They highlighted that, similarly, the Always Discreet Ultimate Day pads were also rated as having the highest absorbency in the Always range, other than the pads intended for night-time use. As such, they were satisfied that the basis of comparison was fair and appropriate. 2. Always did not agree that viewers would read the on-screen text and understand that “Always Discreet Ultimate Day Pads vs Maxi Pad from the leading brand” related to the prior statement “95% of 146 women agree it protects and is discreet.” They explained that the reference to the leading brand was included so that viewers would understand the visual comparison of the two products included in the next frame. Clearcast said that the meaning of the on-screen text was clear. They said it was important to include the text “95% of 146 women agree it protects and is discreet”, because it clarified the dialogue “It protects, and it’s so much thinner …” that could be heard in the ad. They further stated that the on-screen text was a statement, without any inference of comparison. They explained that “so much thinner” was the only comparative claim featured in the ad, and therefore, that it would be clear to viewers that the on-screen text “Always Discreet Ultimate Day Pads vs Maxi pads from the leading brand” qualified that comparative statement. As such, they considered the meaning of both statements was clear and that the first statement would be understood as independent of the second statement regarding the survey.","1. Upheld The ASA noted that the ad featured a side-by-side comparison of the Always Discreet Pad and another pad from the “leading brand”, which appeared considerably thicker than the Always pad. The ad also, in describing the difficulties faced by those who exercised wearing incontinence pads, referred to a “bulky pad”. We acknowledged that the ad did not explicitly reference Tena Lady, but we considered viewers who required incontinence products would be familiar with the sector and understand the leading brand to be Tena Lady, and that the reference to a “bulky pad” described one of their products. We noted that the ad featured a woman who was doubtful that the thinner Always pad would be able to serve her incontinence needs and asked “Will this deal with my leaks?”, before the absorbency capabilities of the pad were demonstrated on screen, as a glass of water was poured on to the Always pad. The woman then stated, “Wow where does it go?”, before the other woman responded, “Who cares? It protects and it’s much thinner” in relation to the Always pad. As such, we considered that viewers would interpret that statement to mean the Always pad continued to offer a high level of absorbency, but was thinner than the equivalent pad from the leading brand. We accepted Always’ comments that the absorption capacity of a pad was not the only factor considered when choosing a sanitary pad, and other factors, such as the capacity for the surface of the pad to stay dry, contributed to the level of protection offered by the pad. However, we considered that, in terms of protection, the ad focused solely on the absorption capabilities of the pad, and furthermore, we noted that other relevant factors in terms of protection were not mentioned or referenced in the ad. We therefore considered that the ad directly linked the absorbency of the product with the protection it offered, and that viewers would interpret the statement “it protects” solely in terms of the pad’s absorbency. We further considered that the overall impression of the ad was that, despite being much thinner, the Always Discreet pad offered an equivalent absorbency to the Tena pad. As such, we considered that consumers would assume Always had selected the competitor pad with the closest equivalent absorbency to feature in the ad in order to demonstrate that their pad offered a similar absorbency in a much thinner product. We understood that both of the featured incontinence pads were rated as having the highest level of absorbency within their respective brand’s range. However, we noted that Always offered seven products as part of their women’s incontinence pad range, in comparison to Tena, who offered 11. Because Always had a smaller range of incontinence pads than Tena, the absorbency of the equivalent pads from each range would not necessarily correspond. We further acknowledged that both of the pads had a similar number of “droplets” ascribed to them, which commonly represented the absorbency level of a pad. However, we understood that the grading system of absorbency was not standardised across different brands of incontinence pads. We therefore considered that, despite the similar droplet rating of the products, the actual absorbency of the pads was not necessarily comparable, and their droplet measurement alone was not sufficient to demonstrate that Always had selected the most appropriate Tena incontinence pad to compare. The featured Always Discreet pad had an absorbency capacity of 242.63g, while the Tena pad had an absorbency capacity of 453.11g, when tested using the Rothwell method. We understood that the Rothwell method was the universal standard for measuring theoretical absorption capacity, and that once the absorbency has been measured, a product’s absorbency could be categorised on a scale from 1 to 15 for incontinence pads, with 1 indicating the least and 15 the most liquid absorbed. We understood that the absorbency of the Always pad was graded as 4 on the scale, whereas the absorbency of the featured Tena pad was graded as 6, and therefore had a higher absorption capacity. We acknowledged comments from Always in relation to the methodology of the Rothwell method, that it was only suitable to measure theoretical, rather than practical absorption, which could be affected by other factors such as posture or position of the user. However, we understood the Rothwell method was a universally accepted test to measure absorption of incontinence products, and we therefore considered it could be used to give an indicative guideline of the difference in absorption capacity between the two products. Given that, and in the absence of evidence which demonstrated a superior absorption capability of the Always pad, we considered that the absorbency capacity of the featured Tena pad was larger than that of the Always pad. We assessed the image of the Always Discreet pad and a different Tena incontinence pad, the Tena Discreet Extra, which was not featured as the “leading brand” pad in the ad, provided by Always. The image was an overhead shot and so we considered it was not possible to assess the thickness of the pads or whether the Always pad was thinner. In any case, whilst we noted that the Tena pad was smaller in length, we considered that this feature did not constitute a different consumer need or purpose, because both were intended to prevent moderate incontinence. Furthermore, we understood that the Tena pad had an absorbency capacity of 278.33g. We considered that was comparable to the Always Discreet pad and, similarly, was graded as 4 on the Rothwell scale. As such, we considered the absorbency of the Tena Discreet Extra pad was more comparable to that of the Always Discreet pad. In addition, we understood that the Tena pad was much thinner than the other Tena pad featured in the ad. Had the ad compared the product with the most similar absorbency, the difference in thickness would have been substantially different. Because the basis of comparison between the two pads in the ad was established against the absorption capability of the pad and its thickness, we considered the most appropriate competitor product had not been featured in the ad, and therefore, because viewers would assume the comparison was against the nearest equivalent product, we concluded the basis of the comparison was misleading. On that point, the ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 and 3.2 (Misleading advertising) and 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors). 2. Upheld On-screen text stated, “Waiting time 20s. 95% of 146 women agree it protects and is discreet. Always Discreet Ultimate Day Pads vs Maxi Pad from the leading brand”. The text appeared when a close-up of water was shown being poured onto the Always pad and remained on screen until the end frame. We considered viewers would understand that the first portion of on-screen text, “Waiting time 20s”, related to and qualified the clip of water being poured. We further considered that the survey results referred to in the on-screen text would be interpreted in relation to the statement “Iit protects, and it’s so much thinner” heard later on in the ad, because the on-screen text directly reflected the statement. However, we considered it was not explicitly clear to viewers what the on-screen text “Always Discreet Ultimate Day Pads vs Maxi Pad from the leading brand” related to, and in the absence of further information, that viewers would understand that it qualified the survey results referred to in the previous sentence of on-screen text. We understood that the survey did not assess the performance of the Always pad in relation to the Tena pad, and instead, that the on-screen text referred to the visual comparison of the pads which could be seen in the ad. However, we noted that when the comparison between the pads appeared on screen, large text labelling the pads as “Always Discreet” and “Leading Brand” could be seen. We considered that further created the impression that the text “Always Discreet Ultimate Day Pads vs Maxi Pad from the leading brand” qualified the survey results, because the basis of comparison was highlighted to viewers via the labelling in large text at the relevant time. Because we considered viewers would understand that text as a qualification to the survey, rather than an independent statement which referred to the side-by-side comparison of the pads in the ad, we concluded that the placement of the on-screen text misleadingly implied that 95% of women preferred the Always pad to the Tena pad. On that point, the ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 and 3.2 (Misleading advertising).",The ad must not be broadcast in its current form. We told Procter & Gamble t/a Always to ensure that the basis of comparison with competitor products did not mislead and not to misleadingly imply that survey results related to a competitor’s product with the placement of on-screen text.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/procter---gamble-uk-a23-1206176-procter--gamble-uk.html
"ASA Ruling on Renault UK Ltd t/a Dacia, Renault",,A paid-for Meta ad for Renault seen on 1 May. The ad contained an image of the Renault Austral car. It contained the text “RETHINK HYBRID WE DID. Up to 80% electric driving in the city. all new Renault Austral E-Tech full hybrid. WLTP test data. actual real world driving results may vary”.,"The ASA challenged whether the ad was misleading, because the basis of the claim “Up to 80% electric driving in the city” was unclear.","Renault UK Ltd (Renault) explained that they have a rigorous approval process whereby ads are reviewed by numerous departments, including the legal department, before they are published. However, this ad was posted in error. While qualifying text stated “WLTP test data. Actual real world driving results may vary”, it should have stated “Actual real world driving results may vary. Internal Renault source 2022”. They discussed the complaint with their marketing team and emphasised the importance of following the CAP and BCAP Code when preparing future ads. They removed the ad and assured us that the same claim would not appear in future marketing communications. Renault explained that the headline claim was based on an internal test completed by Renault’s engineering team which aimed to replicate the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) testing. WLTP testing was the global standard for determining the levels of pollutants, CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of traditional and hybrid cars, as well as determining the mileage range for fully electric cars. Renault repeated the test four times in 23°C external temperature on road conditions. In the four iterations of the test, the engine driving ranged between 8% and 22%, and pure EV driving ranged between 78% and 92%.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that before distributing or submitting a marketing communication for publication, marketers must hold documentary evidence to prove claims that consumers are likely to regard as objective and that are capable of objective substantiation. It also stated that ads must not mislead by hiding material information or presenting it in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner and that the basis of environmental claims must be clear. The ASA acknowledged that the ad had been posted in error, and that Renault had intended it to clarify that the testing was Renault’s own and not the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). We agreed that the test used was material information that needed to be included in the ad and we also acknowledged that the internal test completed by Renault aimed to replicate WLTP testing. However, in using specific reference to “WLTP test data” consumers would be likely to understand that the testing had been carried out by an independent body, which was not the case. Irrespective of the qualifying text error, the ad was headlined “RETHINK HYBRID … Up to 80% electric driving in the city”. However, other than to know the claim was based on test data, it was unclear on what the 80% was based. For example, there were numerous possible interpretations of the claim, including that it reflected the proportion of an individual journey, regardless of distance, that the vehicle was able to cover without having recourse to using petrol or diesel. Another possible interpretation of the claim was that up to 80% of the total number of journeys was covered by the electric source, even if some individual journeys used more than 20% petrol or diesel. Without additional information to explain the context of the headline claim, consumers were unable to make an informed decision about whether to follow up on the ad and pursue an enquiry or purchase. The ad, therefore, omitted material information and was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 11.1 (Environmental claims).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Renault UK Ltd to ensure that ads included all material information needed for consumers to understand their message and reminded them that the basis of environmental claims must be clear.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/renault-uk-ltd-a23-1201059-renault-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on ACME Vape Ltd,,"Two TikTok posts seen in July 2023 which promoted e-cigarettes: a. A post on the IVG TikTok account showed boxes of vapes and other merchandise. Text below the video stated, “Can we just #Ivgbar #unboxing #foryoupage #foryou #fypage #discover #unbox #vapebar”. b. Another post on the IVG TikTok account stated, “IVG Bar Flavour Test Time!” and featured a woman holding several of the bars and saying, “The IVG bars are finally in the house. Let’s go do a flavour test.” Various people who seemed to be in the company’s offices gave positive reactions when they tried the vapes. Text under the video stated, “#lvg #flavourtest time #vapebar#lvg #fyp #fpr you #unboxing # #vapedevice #ivg #vapecommunity"".",,"Acme Vapes Ltd said they were not active on TikTok. They said they did not know the posts were appearing as they were very old posts and had contacted TikTok and asked for them to be removed. TikTok said that the advertiser’s account was still active and that when they were notified of the complaint, they made the ad unavailable to TikTok users in the UK and EEA because it breached their terms of service. Furthermore, promotion of vapes was prohibited under their Branded Content policy. If the poster had engaged with their disclosure tool as required by their Terms of Service and Branded Content Policy, the content would not have been permitted to be posted.","Upheld CAP Code rule 22.12 reflected a legislative ban contained in the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations (TRPR) on the advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes in certain media. The rule stated that, except for media targeted exclusively to the trade, marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components that were not licensed as medicines were not permitted in newspapers, magazines and periodicals, or in online media and some other forms of electronic media. It further stated that factual claims about products were permitted on marketers’ own websites and, in certain circumstances, in other non-paid-for space online under the marketer’s control. The CAP guidance on “Electronic cigarette advertising prohibitions” (the Guidance) explained that the prohibition on ads in “online media and some other forms of electronic media” reflected the legal prohibition on ads in “information society services”. The Guidance indicated that ads placed in paid-for social media placements, advertisement features and contextually targeted branded content were likely to be prohibited. We considered whether TikTok was an online media space where such advertising, using factual claims only, was permitted. We understood that, while promotional content was prohibited on retailers’ own websites, rule 22.12 specified a particular exception that the provision of factual information was not prohibited. The basis of the exception to the rule was because consumers had to specifically seek out that factual information by visiting the website. The Guidance stated that, in principle, there was likely to be scope for the position relating to factual claims being acceptable on marketers’ websites, to apply to some social media activity. A social media page or account might be considered to be analogous to a website and be able to make factual claims if it could only be found by those actively seeking it. We understood that public posts could be seen by anyone who visited the TikTok website on a web browser and by any users of the app. It was possible for public posts from a TikTok account to be distributed beyond those users who had signed up to follow the account due to TikTok’s algorithms and account settings. We considered that was consistent with content being pushed to consumers without having opted-in to receive the message it contained and therefore it was not equivalent to actively seeking out information about e-cigarettes. Given that characteristic, we considered that material from a public TikTok account was not analogous to a retailer’s own website and that material posted from such an account was therefore subject to the prohibition on advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes, meaning that neither promotional nor factual content was permitted. Ads (a) and (b) were posts on the Acme Vapes TikTok account, which promoted that e-cigarette brand. Text below the videos stated, “#lvg #flavourtest time #vapebar#lvg #fyp #fpr you #unboxing # #vapedevice #ivg #vapecommunity"" and “Can we just #Ivgbar #unboxing #foryoupage #foryou #fypage #discover #unbox #vapebar”.

We considered whether the ads directly or indirectly promoted a nicotine-containing e-cigarette. Unlicensed e-cigarettes were prominently featured in the ads, and ad (d) featured positive reviews and recommendations of various flavours. We therefore considered that the ads contained promotional content for the product and consequently the restriction that applied to online media under rule 22.12 was applicable.

ASA Ruling on Cloud City Vapez UK Ltd,,"A TikTok post from Harleigh Perez’s account, @harleighperez, seen on 13 July 2023, featured a video of Harleigh Perez reviewing Elfbar electronic cigarettes sent to her by Cloud City. She explained they “Delivered vapes to your front door and they have a shop in Manchester.” She went on to unbox, vape and review two Elfbar products. She said she loved one of the vapes and that it “Felt so smooth on your throat”. She outlined the number of ‘puffs’ each vape had and said they were rechargeable. She ended the video by saying, “To get your vapes, go onto Cloud City.

They also said it was a possibility that the former employee and Ms Perez were simply friends. They said they had undertaken a review of their content to ensure all social media posts were in line with the CAP Code. Harleigh Perez confirmed she had collaborated with Cloud City and provided text message evidence of that. The messages showed that she had been sent vapes by the company for her to promote on social media. Ms Perez said she believed she was allowed to promote vapes on social media as they were a product sold legally within the UK.

ASA Ruling on CrypticKits,,"An Instagram post and a TikTok post by CrypticKits, seen on 7 June 2023: a. The Instagram post featured an image of a £1 coin.

We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. We considered the reference to “£1 for a mystery football shirt” in both ads would have been interpreted by consumers to mean that they could purchase a football shirt for £1, but that they would not know which team’s shirt they would be buying. We considered that the phrases “This exclusive offer”, “Our football shirts are of the highest quality and come in a range of sizes and colours”, “get your hands on a brand new shirt”, “The perfect gift for any football fan”, “the thrill of unboxing a brand new football shirt” and “Which team will you get?” in ad (a) added to the impression that there were a significant number of shirts available for purchase at £1. Ad (b) also included the phrase “£1 football shirts” which added to the impression that the shirts were available to purchase for £1. We understood from the complainants that consumers were not able to purchase a mystery football shirt for £1, but rather that by paying £1 they would have the chance to win a football shirt .Because we considered the ads gave the impression that consumers could purchase a football shirt for £1 and because we had not seen evidence that that was the case, we concluded that the ads were misleading.The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 3.17 (Prices).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on D&A Cosmetics Ltd,,"A TikTok post on Aimee Crowder’s account @thissinglemamaofficial promoting Plumpit! No Needles Lip Filler Kit, seen in June 2023, featured a video of her using the product. She stated, “It comes with two products. The volumising one which is for instant plumpage, and the hyaluronic one … if you use it regularly enough, it’s gonna give you more long-term results.” In the comments section, Plumpit! Stated, “We can confirm that our Hyaluronic Lip Plumper creates long term plumping results by naturally improving collagen production”.",,"D&A Cosmetics Ltd t/a Plump It! told us that the Hyaluronic Lip Plumper was formulated with an active ingredient called Volulip™ which was tested by the manufacturer, Sederma. They provided a document with the results of the testing. The document showed that the testing was completed on 29 females who each completed a twice daily application of a balm containing 1% Volulip™, for a month. The testing found that 97% of volunteers had an increase in the surface of the central area of the lower lip, and 69% of participants had an increase in lip volume, with an average 15.1% increase in volume. There were also positive results regarding lip softness, firmness, absorption, tissue density and hydration. The testing also concluded that after 30 days of usage, there was an increase in collagen production, moisture molecules and dermal-epidermal junction molecules in the lips. Plump It! told us that the testing showed that after using the balm every day for a month, there was a large increase in the synthesis of collagen in the lips, and this increased lip volume. The document stated that the increase in collagen production and lip volume was the effect of Volulip™, and Plump It! believed the results demonstrated that there were long-term effects of using the Hyaluronic Lip Plumper.","Upheld In the ad, Aimee Crowder stated, “… and the hyaluronic one … if you use it regularly enough, it’s gonna give you more long-term results”, and Plump It! commented “our Hyaluronic Lip Plumper creates long term plumping results by naturally improving collagen production”. The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the claims that regular use of Hyaluronic Lip Plumper would give increased volume for an unspecified period of time after the product was used. In addition, the claim “naturally improving collagen production” implied that the Hyaluronic Lip Plumper would have a physiological, rather than a cosmetic effect. A high-level body of relevant evidence was, therefore, needed to evidence the claims in the ad. We acknowledged the positive results outlined in the test provided by Plump It!. However, it appeared that the testing, which ended after one month, did not determine if the claimed effects continued after participants stopped using the balm. We therefore considered that the testing did not demonstrate that the effects of the balm extended beyond the application period. Further to that while the data suggested positive results, it had not been peer reviewed, there was no control group and the testing did not use the Hyaluronic Lip Plumper but a different balm containing 1% Volulip™. The data therefore was insufficiently robust to be used as evidence for the product having a physiological effect. For those reasons, we considered that the evidence provided by Plump It! did not sufficiently substantiate claims for the Hyaluronic Lip Plumper to have a long-term effect. In addition, claims for the product to have a physiological effect by naturally improving collagen production had not been evidenced. We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to mislead.The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), 3.11 (Exaggeration), and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained about.

We also have liquid marine collagen because marine collagen contains amino acids and glycine which is great for skin health and also marine collagen is brilliant at stimulating the production of elastin which we know makes the skin look more youthful and also helps iron out all those wrinkles …”","The complainant challenged whether the claims: 1. “help maintain the elasticity and firmness of your skin”, “reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles” and “thicker hair” were misleading and could be substantiated; and 2. “your skin being more hydrated”, “stronger nails” and “improved joint health"" complied with the Code.",1. Kollo Health Ltd said they had removed the ad for the duration of the ASA investigation. They believed the ad complied with the Code but indicated their willingness to make any necessary changes. They said the presenter of the video was referring to collagen in general rather than making any specific claims about their product. Kollo explained that each sachet of their product contained 10 g of Naticol marine collagen. Naticol had undergone various clinical trials on humans. Kollo provided documentation which they believed substantiated the claims. 2. Kollo explained that they had been unaware of the requirement for health claims in advertising to be authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB register) and said they would consult it in future to ensure their advertising complied.,"1. Upheld The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB Register) were permitted in marketing communications for foods. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food, or ingredient, and health. The ASA understood that the function of skin was to provide a permeable barrier against the external environment. We considered that claims which stated or implied a beneficial physiological effect on, or change to, the structure of the skin to aid in its function of providing a barrier were health claims for the purposes of the Code. In contrast, claims which related to temporary improvements in the appearance or maintenance of normal appearance of the skin and did not refer to a beneficial physiological effect on a specific function of skin were, therefore, cosmetic claims, rather than health claims. Cosmetic claims were not required to be authorised on the GB Register; instead, advertisers must hold evidence to support such claims. We considered that assessing whether claims were health claims or cosmetic claims required an assessment of the specific claims made and the overall context of the ad. Although Kollo believed that the video portion of the ad made claims for collagen in general, in the introductory section the presenter mentioned Kollo by name and was shown holding the product. We therefore considered that consumers would understand that the claims related to the product.We considered that the claims ""help maintain the elasticity and firmness of your skin” and “reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles” were likely to be understood by consumers as cosmetic claims about the product’s temporary beneficial effect on the appearance of skin, specifically in improving its texture and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. We also considered that in the context of an ad that did not refer to hair growth or prevention of hair loss, consumers would be likely to interpret the claim ""thicker hair"" as a cosmetic claim that the product could lead to hair which appeared plumped or thicker in diameter rather than an increase in the number of hair strands on the head. We therefore assessed the evidence provided by Kollo in support of the cosmetic claims in the ad: “help maintain the elasticity and firmness of your skin”, “reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles” and “thicker hair”. A consumer panel study evaluated the effect of a daily 10 g dose of Naticol on 52 female participants from the Tokyo area in Japan over 30 days. Participants were asked to self-evaluate wrinkles, skin hydration, firmness and brightness after two and four weeks. We considered that subjective responses to a consumer perception questionnaire did not constitute adequate evidence for the objective claims in the ad. We also had concerns that the survey cohort was small and of a limited demographic that was not representative of the general population. A double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical study carried out by a French laboratory assessed 40 female subjects aged between 54 and 64 years. Twenty randomly assigned participants took 10g Naticol daily for 12 weeks (the “intervention group”). The other 20 participants were given a placebo of maltodextrin (the “placebo group”). The trial measured skin elasticity at the start and end of the trial period using a cutometer and assessed wrinkles after 6 and 12 weeks by using specialised software to analyse rubber impressions taken of the skin. Participants and investigators were also questioned about perceived wrinkle reduction and whether they thought the product was effective against signs of aging. The study reported a significant increase in skin smoothing (9.37%) in the periorbital zone and in skin extensibility (23.7%) in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. The survey of participants and investigators reported perceived wrinkle reduction in 79% of the intervention group compared to 58% in the placebo group. However, we considered that 20 participants in the intervention group and 20 in the control group did not constitute a sufficiently large sample size. We also had concerns that the study cohort, made up of female participants between 54 and 64 years of age was not representative of the general population and the study had not been published or peer-reviewed. Furthermore, we noted one of the inclusion criteria for the participants was for them to have “periorbital lines of medium to moderate severity corresponding at least to level 3 of the classification of Lemperle”. We understood the Lemperle scale defined level 3 as “Moderately deep wrinkles”. We considered that a study that measured effects on moderate lines would not necessarily be relevant to substantiate an efficacy claim for “fine lines and wrinkles”. Three further studies evaluated the effects of Naticol. In two of the studies participants took a 2.5 g dose and in the third they took a 5 g dose. We considered that those studies were not relevant to the advertised claims because they did not relate to the advertised 10 mg dose. We also considered that a summary of an in vitro study of collagen synthesis was not relevant substantiation for the claims. Kollo did not provide any evidence in support of the claim “thicker hair”.For those reasons, we concluded that the claims “help maintain the elasticity and firmness of your skin”, “reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles” and “thicker hair” had not been substantiated and were therefore misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 2. Upheld We considered that the claim “your skin being more hydrated” would be understood to mean that the product would have a beneficial physiological effect on the skin’s function as a barrier, in particular by protecting it against dehydration. Similarly, we considered that the claim “stronger nails” would be understood to mean that the product would alter the physical structure of a person’s nails so as to make them stronger and less susceptible to breakage. We therefore considered that the claims were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code. Specific health claims used in ads must be authorised on the GB Register, and could only be made for the nutrient, substance, food or food category for which they had been authorised. However, we had not seen evidence that the above claims were authorised on the GB Register in relation to either collagen or the Kollo product. We considered that the claim “improved joint health” would be understood to mean the product had a general beneficial effect on the joints. The Code required that general health claims, which were claims that referred to the general benefits of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health related well-being, must be accompanied by a specific authorised health claim. However, the claim was not accompanied by any relevant, specific authorised health claim as was required. Because we had not seen any evidence that the specific health claims (“your skin being more hydrated” and “stronger nails”) were authorised on the GB Register and the general health claim (“improved joint health”) was not accompanied by a specific authorised health claim, we concluded that they breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1, 15.2 (Foods, food supplements and associated health and nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Foods, food supplements and other vitamins and minerals).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Kollo Health Ltd not to state or imply that their product could maintain the elasticity and firmness of the skin, reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles or lead to thicker hair unless they held robust evidence to substantiate the claims. We also told them to ensure that, in future, their ads did not contain general health claims that were unaccompanied by an authorised specific health claim or unauthorised specific health claims.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/kollo-health-ltd-a23-1196136-kollo-health-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Organic Burst World SA t/a Organic Burst,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Organic Burst, an online retailer of food supplements and food products, seen on 17 March 2023, made various claims for the food supplement spirulina. Text stated “One of the known reasons for early grey hair is Vitamin B12 deficiency … Spirulina contains methylcobalamin, a very effective and absorbable form of Vitamin B12 … Did You Know? Taking just 1-2 tsp Spirulina a day can … reverse gray [sic] hair …”.",,,"Upheld The ASA was concerned by Organic Burst World S.A.’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The Code further required that ads for foods, including food supplements, must not claim to treat clinical vitamin deficiencies or state or imply that a food or food supplement could prevent, treat or cure human disease. We considered readers would interpret the ad, which stated that Vitamin B12 deficiency was a cause of the early growth of grey hair and that Spirulina contained “a very effective and absorbable form of Vitamin B12”, and which contained the claim “Taking just 1-2 tsp Spirulina a day can … reverse gray [sic] hair …” to mean that consuming the stated quantity of spirulina would correct vitamin B12 deficiency and, as a result, reverse the growth of grey hair. We considered that the ad claimed that the food supplement could treat a clinical vitamin deficiency and one of its symptoms. We concluded that the ad therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.9 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Organic Burst World S.A. to ensure their ads did not state or imply that a food supplement could prevent, treat or cure human disease or treat clinical vitamin or mineral deficiencies and their symptoms, including the reversal of the growth of grey hair. We referred the matter to the CAP Compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/organic-burst-world-sa-a23-1191380-organic-burst-world-s-a-.html
ASA Ruling on Toyota (GB) plc,,"A paid for Facebook post and a poster ad for Toyota: a. The Facebook post stated, “From Active Traction Control to Hill Start Assist, Toyota Hilux, Born to Roam”. An accompanying video showed a wide open plain with mountains either side. A swarm was depicted from a distance moving across the plain, causing dust to rise. A number of Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) were then shown moving across the landscape in unison before joining a tarmacked road. A voiceover said, “One of nature’s true spectacles.” The vehicles were then shown on the road, side by side, and driving through a built-up city area with a single vehicle then shown reversing up a driveway. The voiceover continued, “Toyota Hilux. Born to Roam.” A final shot showed the car parked in a rocky, natural environment. Text stated “WWW.TOYOTA.CO.UK BORN TO ROAM Learn more”. b. The poster, seen at a bus stop, stated, “BORN TO ROAM”. An image showed two SUVs driving on a rocky incline in a savannah style landscape. Around 50 identical SUVs appeared in a large pack on a hilly background.",,"Toyota (GB) plc explained that they were committed to positive environmental change and had introduced several hybrid and electric vehicles across their range since 1997. In addition, they had granted hundreds of royalty-free licences for the use of their hybrid technology. All of which demonstrated the importance they gave to environmental responsibility. They said the ads had been through a thorough checking process for both technical capability claims and wider generic claims for the vehicle and/or the brand.Regarding ad (a) they said the footage of the vehicles off-road was minimal and when they appeared they were never in an environment which was ecologically sensitive or a habitat with wildlife. Further to that the terrains depicted in the ads were all areas for which the vehicle was designed.. The Hilux was meant for the toughest environments and certain industries had a genuine need for off-road which included specialised workers such as farmers, forestry workers and park rangers. They said they were entitled to advertise to those markets and should be allowed to depict suitable off-road environments to demonstrate the off-road capabilities of the vehicle. However, they stated that they should be allowed to do that in a way that was not restrictive and did not involve depicting a specialised worker character or scenario in the ads. They further stated that if ads were able to show cars on race tracks or circuits, then off-road environments should also be permissible. The video had been shot in Slovenia on private land, with permission, and it was unlikely that viewers would see the environment depicted as being in the UK. They explained that the use of multiple vehicles, which they believed was clearly fantastical, added to the argument that a viewer was unlikely to replicate the ad in the UK countryside. They said that the fantastical presentation of the large number of vehicles would prevent consumers emulating the ad and driving in large numbers in the wild. They explained that despite the Hilux’s off-road capabilities, and the need to make specialised purchasers aware of that, they limited the off-road footage because of their dedicated environmental stance and consideration for social responsibility. They said as a result, based on screen time, the emphasis of the ad was not on the off-road scenes. Specifically there were four off-road scenes taking up 11 to 12 seconds of a 30-second video. The first scene was in a desert with mountains either side. It was shot from the middle distance and so it would not have been possible to identify the terrain but there was nothing to say it was inappropriate for car use. In addition, the number of cars, the trailer and background gravel indicated that the vehicles were on a road or unpaved road. A close up in one scene indicated a dusty, unpaved road. The second scene showed a forest surrounding an open gravel plain. The ground of the open plain had visible tyre tracks, indicating it was a regularly used off-road path. A third scene featured a visibly beaten track or unpaved road suggesting regular use. The track joined a public road and so indicated that it was suitable for and designed for vehicles. The fourth scene showed the car parked and did not indicate any irresponsible off-road use. They explained that the speed of the vehicles in the ad was appropriate and while dust was shown when the cars moved, that was not an example of irresponsible driving. They further said that the line “One of nature’s true spectacles” was a reference to a herd of vehicles and not to damage or destruction of a natural setting. Toyota believed no reasonable viewer would have understood the ad as encouraging UK consumers to drive irresponsibly in the UK countryside and cause environmental harm.Regarding ad (b) they said the image had been created completely by computer generated imagery (CGI) and so caused no damage to the natural environment. They understood the image would be seen as similar to a herd of wildebeests and therefore fantastical. In addition, and similar to ad (a), the landscape, which was akin to African plains, bore no resemblance to the UK or UK countryside, which indicated again that the ad was fantastical and would not lead to UK consumers emulating the large number of vehicles in the wild. They said that the slogan ‘Born to Roam’ was intended to reflect the ability of the car to operate off-road and cope with different terrain. They believed it would not be interpreted as encouraging or excusing driving behaviour that was negative to the environment. They said an off-road vehicle by definition was one used for rough terrain and the slogan ‘Born to Roam’, alongside the images and videos, visually represented that definition.","Upheld Marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The ASA acknowledged Toyota’s comments that the sheer volume of cars in the ads would lead viewers to interpret the scenes as fantastical and not as a portrayal of real-world driving. Ad (a) initially presented a large volume of cars in a rural setting seen from a distance, all moving as one across an open landscape in a manner that some viewers might infer was analogous to a herd of animals and therefore might be viewed as fantastical. However, the scenes that followed in ad (a) showed a much smaller number of cars at close-up, driving realistically at speed across an untarmacked, off-road landscape including across a river. Toyota had explained that some of the rural scenes in ad (a) were on roads or unpaved tracks. However, that was not clear in the ad. The emphasis of the ads was on the off-road settings displayed and the vehicle’s movement without restriction, which was highlighted by the messaging, “One of nature’s true spectacles” and “Born to roam”. The latter scenes saw the vehicles driving realistically on roads, and in heavily built-up urban settings, with a final scene again depicting one vehicle parked in an off-road landscape. Ad (b) also showed a number of vehicles in the distance and two prominent vehicles close up, which were depicted realistically in an off-road setting. The vehicles in ad (a) travelled across untarmacked plains and through rivers, with dust and scree visibly disturbed. In ad (b) the main vehicle appeared on a rocky slope, and other vehicles in the background travelled across similar terrain as seen in ad (a). While we acknowledged Toyota’s point that they were in part targeting specialised vehicle users, such as farmers or forest workers, who might legitimately need to use vehicles in rural or off-road environments, those scenarios were not represented in the ad, which included driving by unidentifiable categories of vehicle users in both rural and urban environments. We therefore considered that the impression given by the driving scenes and messaging in both ads was one of driving regardless of its purpose, across off-road environments and natural ecosystems which had no regard for the environmental impact of such driving. The ads presented and condoned the use of vehicles in a manner that disregarded their impact on nature and the environment. As a result, they had not been prepared with a sense of responsibility to society.The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Compliance).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Toyota (GB) plc to ensure their future marketing communications contained nothing that was likely to encourage irresponsible behaviour towards the environment.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/toyota--gb--plc-a23-1191673-toyota--gb--plc.html

ASA Ruling on Borthwick Group (Energy) Ltd,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for the Borthwick Group, a credit broker, seen on 14 June 2023, featured an image of a red box with text in white, on a red background, that stated “BREAKING […] FREE REPLACEMENT BOILERS AVAILABLE FOR HOMEOWNERS IN RECEIPT OF BENEFITS”. The image also featured the text “BG NEWS”. A caption accompanying the image stated “Attention Homeowners! Is your heating system 10 years old? Upgrade to an energy-efficient Combi Boiler for FREE with the ECO 4 scheme. You could also qualify for FREE home insulation”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad suggested it had been endorsed or approved by The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).,"Borthwick Group (Energy) Ltd t/a Borthwick Group said the ad had not been running for serval months and that they were committed to ensuring their advertising remained consistent with industry standards. They said that while they understood the complainants’ concerns, in their view the ad had not breached any trademarks or copyrights, or directly made any false claims. They said the ad clearly stated their name and company logo, and that it was common practice for news outlets and advertisers to use “breaking” in their ads. They confirmed the ad had not been approved by the BBC.","Upheld The ASA welcomed Borthwick Group’s assurance that the ad had been withdrawn. The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not claim that the marketer (or any other entity referred to), the marketing communication or the advertised product had been approved, endorsed or authorised by any public or other body if it has not. We considered the use of a red background with white text that stated “BREAKING” and the presentation of “BG NEWS” in white squares with cut-out text was stylistically similar to that of a BBC breaking news Facebook post. We therefore considered the ad gave the impression it had been endorsed or approved by the BBC. However, we understood the ad had not been endorsed or approved by the BBC. We therefore concluded that it was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 3.50 (Endorsements and Testimonials).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on FanCraze Technologies Inc,"On 8 October 2023, the FCA took over the regulation of ads for ‘qualifying cryptoassets’ – cryptoassets that are transferable and fungible. The rules apply to all firms’ marketing, qualifying cryptoassets to UK consumers, regardless of which country they are based in, or the technology used. However, cryptoassets as a product remain unregulated. The new rules do not cover cryptoassets that are non-fungible, such as the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) seen in this ad, or Limited Payment Tokens that can only be redeemed with the issuer and used for the payments of specific goods and services, such as non-monetary customer loyalty points. Summary of Council decision: Four issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A tweet from the Essex County Cricket club Twitter/X account which promoted NFTs for FanCraze Technologies, posted on 30 May 2023, stated “Unveiling a new way of fandom with @OxFanCraze! Supporters can now collect, trade and play cricket strategy games with licensed player cards of their favourites to win cash rewards & never seen before fan experiences!” A link to the FanCraze website was included in the post. The post also included an image of cricketers. Text on the image stated “Essex is taking fandom to the next level!” and “www.fancraze.com”.","The ASA challenged whether the ad: 1. was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication; and 2. did not make clear which cryptowallet a prospective buyer would need in order to receive a token, and which blockchain the tokens operated on, and was therefore misleading. One complainant challenged whether the ad was misleading because: 3. it did not make clear that it was referring to an investment product or that gas fees applied; and 4. it failed to illustrate the risk of the investment.","1. Essex County Cricket Club said they had a partnership with FanCraze in which they promoted their digital collectibles (NFTs). They acknowledged the tweet was advertising and apologised for failing to disclose it as such, as required by the CAP Code. They confirmed they had deleted the post in question and stated they would ensure all future ads complied with the Code. FanCraze Technologies Inc. also confirmed they had a commercial relationship with Essex County Cricket Club and acknowledged the tweet should have been correctly labelled as advertising. They stated they would conduct comprehensive training sessions for their staff and partners involved in advertising and social media activities. Essex County Cricket Club were not required to respond to issues 2, 3 and 4. 2. FanCraze Technologies Inc. (FanCraze) said consumers could only use credit cards, debit cards and bank transfers to purchase NFTs on the FanCraze platform and that transactions took place in US Dollars. They stated that cryptocurrencies, tokens, stablecoins and all other digital assets were prohibited on the FanCraze platform. FanCraze said that cryptowallets were not needed to access the NFTs. FanCraze confirmed that the NFTs on its platform were stored on the Flow Blockchain and users could only trade their tokens with other users on the FanCraze peer-to-peer marketplace platform and not outside of the service. 3. FanCraze said they did not believe their product qualified as an investment product. They said they partnered with sports organisations including the International Cricket Council, the Asian Cricket Council, County Cricket Clubs and the Indian Premier League to license the usage of intellectual property rights owned by these organisations. FanCraze stated they used these licensed rights to create NFTs that existed on the Flow Blockchain, a public blockchain network, which they said was also used by other prominent sports leagues. They said the NFTs could only be accessed by consumers and sold or traded through FanCraze’s peer-to-peer marketplace platform and they could be used to play cricket-based video games online. They also said users could win free collectibles on the platform. 4. FanCraze explained that the accepted payment methods for users to add funds to their accounts were credit cards, debit cards and bank transfers only. However, they acknowledged the value of the NFTs on the FanCraze platform could fluctuate based on the stardom, demand and on-field performances of the players they were associated with. They stated all future marketing communications in the UK would therefore include a disclaimer which highlighted that NFTs carried inherent risk, including price volatility and lack of regulatory oversight.","1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such, and they must make clear their commercial intent if that was not obvious from the context. In addition, marketers and publishers must make clear that advertorials were marketing communications. The ASA first assessed whether the tweet was a marketing communication and if it fell within the remit of the CAP Code. We understood that FanCraze had a commercial relationship with Essex County Cricket Club, who had been paid to promote the company on social media. Because payment was made for the tweet and FanCraze had control over the content of the tweet, we considered that it fell within the remit of the CAP Code. We then assessed whether the tweet was obviously identifiable as a marketing communication. The tweet had been posted on Essex County Cricket Club’s Twitter/X account and did not contain any label or identifier, such as #ad, to make clear upfront that it was a marketing communication for FanCraze. We therefore concluded that the post was not obviously identifiable as a marketing communication. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.4 (Recognition of marketing communications). 2. Upheld We noted FanCraze stated that consumers could only use credit cards, debit cards and bank transfers to purchase NFTs on the platform and that transactions took place in US Dollars, and that a cryptowallet with cryptocurrency in it was not required to access the service. The ad did not make any reference to a cryptowallet being required to be able to purchase the NFTs or that they existed on a blockchain. However, text on the ‘Terms of Use’ section of the FanCraze website stated users would need a FanCraze Wallet, which was an electronic wallet on the Flow Blockchain, accessed via the FanCraze platform, which FanCraze confirmed was the only place the NFTs could be sold or traded. We considered that was important information consumers would want to know about upfront. Because the ad did not make consumers aware that a FanCraze wallet was required to purchase the NFTs, and that they existed on a blockchain, we concluded that the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 3.9 (Qualification). 3. Upheld The ad highlighted that consumers could use NFTs to win “cash rewards”, and emphasised their worth. We considered that by doing so, the ad promoted NFTs on the FanCraze platform as investments. More generally, we considered consumers might purchase NFTs to acquire something that had a store of value that they hoped would hold or increase in value over time and that they would view the purchasing and trading of NFTs as an investment opportunity. However, the ad did not make any reference to it promoting an investment product and we considered that this was material information, the omission of which was likely to mislead consumers. Furthermore, as per the “Terms of Service” section on the FanCraze website, we also understood that consumers were liable to pay a ‘gas fee’ for every transaction on the Flow Network, which we considered to be material information that consumers would want to know upfront. Because the ad did not include any risk warning making consumers aware that they were liable to pay a gas fee, and that it was referring to an investment product, we concluded that the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification) and 14.4 (Financial products). 4. Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications for investments made clear that the value of investments was variable and, unless guaranteed, could go down as well as up, and also that significant limitations and qualifications were stated and presented clearly. We also understood that NFTs were a volatile cryptoasset, subject to frequent change and one that could potentially lead to large losses. Given the risks and complexities associated with cryptoassets, we considered this was material information that consumers would want to know before engaging with NFTs. We welcomed FanCraze’s assurance that they would ensure all future marketing communications in the UK would include a disclaimer which highlighted that NFTs carried inherent risk, including price volatility and lack of regulatory oversight.In addition, because the NFTs purchased by consumers could only be used on the FanCraze platform, we considered the ad, and all future marketing communications, should also highlight the NFTs existed on a proprietary system and could not be sold or traded outside of it. Because the ad did not make consumers aware that NFTs were an unregulated cryptoasset and that the value of NFTs could go down as well as up, we concluded that the ad was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), 3.9 (Qualification) and 14.4 (Financial products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told FanCraze Technologies Inc. and Essex County Cricket Club to ensure that their future ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications. We also told FanCraze to ensure their advertising made clear the risks of NFTs by stating that they were an unregulated cryptoasset which required a cryptowallet and that their value could go down as well as up and included all material information regarding fees and the limitations of owning NFTs on a proprietary system.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/fancraze-technologies-inc-a23-1199796-fancraze-technologies-inc.html
ASA Ruling on GM Unicorn Corporation Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An ad for the mobile app game My Fantasy, seen in the mobile app game Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells on 23 December 2022, included an animated video of a female character in lingerie who was depicted to be overweight. A small icon near the bottom left of the video featured the woman with an older man, identified as her husband, who was shown telling her, “Make yourself more sexy”. A label above her head that stated “Your brain age: 22” appeared throughout the ad. The video continued by depicting a hand pointer altering the female character’s appearance, with slider controls that enlarged her lips, reduced her waist and augmented her breasts, with text above the character that stated “IMPROVE YOURSELF”. The result depicted the woman in lingerie with an hourglass body shape, enlarged breasts and lips blowing a kiss. The final scene featured the female character with her husband, who was shown to have an angry expression while the female character was frowning. The husband had a speech bubble in front of him that stated “I’m all for natural beauty”. The ad concluded with an image that showed two young women, with the text “What will you choose?” that gave the options “Hey … Stop it” and “Please continue”.","The complainant, who believed that the ad promoted body-shaming, sexualised and objectified women, and depicted harmful gender stereotypes, challenged whether the ad: 1. was irresponsible, harmful, and offensive; and 2. had been irresponsibly targeted. ","1. & 2. GM Unicorn Corporation Ltd confirmed that the ad in question was no longer appearing. They said that My Fantasy was an interactive story app that featured imaginary scenarios related to love and romance. Users were presented with different stories and had to make decisions within them, each with their own consequences. They said the app, besides entertainment, attempted to promote inclusivity, freedom of choice in relationships and the ability to take responsibility. One of the ways it did that was by reflecting stereotypes and socially controversial issues, in order to expose them and allow users to assess them in a humorous, non-judgemental environment. The complainant had provided the ASA with a series of screenshots of the ad. We therefore asked GM Unicorn for a full electronic copy of the ad. They responded that they were unable to provide the ad in question, however, they sent a copy of a similar video which was labelled “old creative”. GM Unicorn’s comments below relate to the “old creative” video. They said it exposed and ridiculed, rather than promoted, toxic relationships, body-shaming, sexualising and objectifying women, gender stereotypes, and making poor life choices. Unlike the named main character Emma, her “husband” was nameless because he was intended to represent a stereotype. The husband, who suddenly decided that his wife was not attractive enough, proposed to give her money to make herself more attractive. They said this was intended to expose the stereotype that a man may do practically anything in a relationship and automatically be forgiven if he was rich. The poor conduct continued when Emma happily accepted a credit card and instantly forgot about the insult. The situation was depicted as comically absurd, peaking when the joking text “Improve Yourself” appeared near the icon “Your brain age: 22” which was shown to increase with each decision, such as enlarging her lips to the maximum, making her left breast larger than the right one, reducing her waist to the minimum, and enormously widening her hips. After all these steps were taken, her brain age was increased to 65, to demonstrate how “wise” the hypothetical user had become. This was intended to allude to the “expanded brain” meme. Ironically, her husband then said to her that he was “all for natural beauty” and she was seen to shed waterfall-like tears. In relation to the targeting of the ad, they considered that the ad was appropriate for distribution to various age categories. While the app was designed primarily for an adult audience, the fantasy love and romance stories featured no explicit content and did not have a sexual theme. They further said that the stories in the app were quite lengthy and comprehensive, which needed prolonged and engaged interaction. That resonated predominantly with an adult audience. The relevant age restrictions were stated in the app’s description on apps stores, as well as the app’s terms and conditions. Furthermore, they said that the app’s style and theme deterred children from downloading and engaging with it. Therefore, even though the app was adult-oriented, they considered that the occasional delivery of age-appropriate ads that did not contain explicit or harmful content was not in breach of the Code, provided there were also deterrents in place that would prevent children from accessing adult-oriented content within the app. It also made no economic sense to target children if the target audience was adult. GM Unicorn referenced three of ASA rulings in support of their arguments. Zynga Inc., the app developer of Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells, and Chartboost Inc., the ad network that served the ad, provided a joint response. They explained that third-party ads which appeared in Zynga’s games were typically served into their advertising space using a number of ad networks. The ad in question was served via Chartboost Exchange, their programmatic ad exchange which utilised real-time bidding on advertising space. They said that this process was almost entirely automated, and it was not possible for either Zynga or Chartboost to have advanced sight of, or review, every ad served. Chartboost said that their contracts with advertisers and other platforms required those parties to ensure that their ads complied with all applicable laws and regulations, including Chartboost’s own policies which prohibited obscene, offensive and indecent content. They also used tools to filter out and block certain ad categories, including provocative or suggestive imagery, and they made tools available to publishers that allowed them to filter out specific ad categories. Zynga said that they used those tools to block content which they considered inappropriate for the players of their games, taking into account factors such as the target audience of each game, which could be different to the game’s age rating displayed in app stores. In their view, the age rating was just an indication of the gameplay content that was in the game and not a reflection of the actual player base the game was targeted at or who should play the game. Regarding Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells in particular, they said that the player base was predominantly adult, with the target audience aged 18 to 49 years. At the time the ad was served, the blocks on provocative or suggestive imagery and ads under the sexuality, dating and pornography categories should have prevented the ad from appearing in the game. However, they recognised that advertisers had ways to get around blocklists or filters such as misclassifying or renaming their ad, changing its URL, or using an agency. Zynga said they had received seven complaints about the ad and had blocked it from appearing in the game and other games in their portfolio. Chartboost also confirmed that they had blocked GM Unicorn Corporation’s ads for their apps My Fantasy and Passion: Romance Books Library from being served via their ad exchange. ","1. Upheld The ASA noted that the video of the “old creative” that GM Unicorn Ltd had provided, had a number of differences to the ad seen by the complainant, including an increase to Emma’s “brain age” throughout the ad. We therefore based the assessment of the ad on the screenshots sent by the complainant. Nevertheless, we were satisfied that the images provided sufficient content to allow us to make an assessment on the issues raised. The ad, which was for a game app about interactive roleplaying, including of a sexual nature, featured an animated female character with her breasts partially exposed. In the initial frame of the ad, the female character was shown to be overweight and told by her husband to “Make yourself more sexy”. She was then shown to alter her appearance by plumping up her lips, shrinking her waist and enlarging her breasts, while the text “IMPROVE YOURSELF!” appeared above her head. We understood that the changes to the character’s appearance alluded to obtaining cosmetic surgery and other cosmetic interventions such as liposuction, breast implants and lip fillers. The text “IMPROVE YOURSELF!” implied that having cosmetic surgery and other interventions was a positive and desirable change, which irresponsibly created pressure to conform to an idealised gender-stereotypical body. Furthermore, the portrayal of the female character changing her appearance to appease her husband amplified a harmful gender stereotype by objectifying women and was likely to cause serious and widespread offence. We assessed GM Unicorn’s response which stated that the stereotypes depicted in the ad were intended to be satirical. We considered that in the absence of further context of the My Fantasy gameplay, viewers were unlikely to interpret the ad as a self-aware parody. We also considered that the narrative and humour in the ad derived specifically from the use of the gender stereotype. We did not consider that the use of humour in the ad mitigated the effect of the harmful stereotype; indeed it was central to it, because the humour derived from the audiences’ familiarity with the stereotype being portrayed. We concluded that the ad was irresponsible, likely to cause serious and widespread offence, and included a gender stereotype in a way that was likely to cause harm. The ad therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).  2. Upheld The ad should not have been served in any context because its content was irresponsible, harmful and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. Notwithstanding that, we understood the advertised game had an age rating of 17+ on Google Play and a sexual theme. In that context, we expected GM Unicorn Corporation to have targeted ads for the game to people aged 18 years and over by using age-verification measures including interest-based targeting factors which described an adult audience and excluded a child audience. We had not seen any evidence that GM Unicorn Corporation had taken steps to target ads for the game away from those under 18 years of age. We therefore concluded that the ad had been irresponsibly targeted. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility). ","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told GM Unicorn Corporation Ltd to ensure that their ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious and widespread offence or harm, for example by exploiting insecurities around body image and objectifying women. We also told them to ensure their ads for games that were not suitable to be played by under 18-year-olds were responsibly targeted.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/gm-unicorn-corporation-ltd-A22-1180376.html
ASA Ruling on Harvey Water Softeners Ltd,,"A website homepage for Harvey Water Softeners, www.harveywatersofteners.co.uk, a retailer of water softeners, seen on 29 May 2023. The page showed a picture of a water softener and stated “Save up to £1,100*”. Further down the page it stated “*across your bills, shopping, and maintenance depending on your location in the UK”. The ad contained a bullet point which stated “Reduce your bills by up to 30%”.","The complainant challenged whether the claims “Save up to £1,100” and “reduce your energy bills by up to 30%” were misleading and could be substantiated.","Harvey Water Softeners Ltd said an average family of four could generate up to 70kg of limescale per year and there were around 13 million households in the UK with hard water. They said, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, this equated to 910,000 tonnes of limescale per year, but since the pandemic there had been a 46% rise in water usage. They provided a link to a press release by Cranfield University from March 2021 that demonstrated the increase. They said that the increase in water use had created an extra 418,600 tonnes of limescale. Based on that, they calculated that 1,328,600 tonnes of limescale had built up in hard water areas in the UK during the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. They said the average UK household spent £33.40 a week on energy and water bills and provided a link to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) that showed this. They provided a paper by the UK Water Treatment Association (UKWTA) that listed a summary of studies by different organisations and universities into hard water and the treatment of it. One of these studies concluded that 0.5 mm of limescale increased fuel costs by 9.4%. Harvey Water Softeners said an average household in a hard water area would gain 1.5 mm of limescale a year, and so using a water softener could generate savings of up to 28.2% based on the estimated increase in fuel costs caused by limescale. They acknowledged that they had rounded up 28.2% to achieve the savings claim “Reduce your bills by up to 30%”, but said they would amend the claim to accurately reflect the percentage figure in future. They believed the studies cited in the UKWTA paper demonstrated that energy usage for a gas boiler, a gas water heater and an electric water heater all decreased after being descaled. The studies also showed that those appliances became less efficient when they were not descaled.","Upheld The ad stated “Save up to £1,100” and “Reduce your bills by up to 30%” which the ASA considered consumers would understand to mean that by installing a water softener in the home, a significant proportion of people would be able to make savings of this amount and reduce their energy bills by 30%. We therefore expected the advertiser to hold evidence to demonstrate that was the case. We noted that, in their response, Harvey Water Softeners made a number of projections based on average water consumption for a typical UK household. However, we were not provided with any evidence to substantiate these estimates, and as such, could not take them into consideration. We then reviewed the evidence provided by Harvey Water Softeners. We first assessed the Cranfield University press release, which stated there had been a 46% increase in household water consumption. However, we were not provided with the full study which determined an increase in water consumption, and as such, we were unable to assess the methodology and results. In any case, because the increase in water usage was not used to calculate the savings claims in the ad, we considered that the press release was not directly relevant to those claims, and consequently, we did not consider it sufficient to support the claims made in the ad. Harvey Water Softeners also provided data from the ONS that stated the average UK household spent £33.40 a week on energy and water bills. Whilst we accepted the ONS figure, it was not clear how it related to the savings claim of £1,100 in the ad, nor were we provided with further data to explain its relevance. We therefore considered that the ONS data did not substantiate the claims in the ad. We next assessed the annual savings data following the installation of a water softener. The data showed the annual savings for several hard water regions in England, based on projected savings across bills, detergent, other household items, and the maintenance of household appliances following the installation of a water softener. However, we noted it was not clear from the data how the annual savings had been calculated and, in any case, they did not appear to be based on the experience of those in hard water areas who had reduced their expenditure following the installation of a Harvey Water softener. As such, we were not able to assess the methodology of the calculations, and considered that without that information, projected savings claims were not sufficient to substantiate the claim. Furthermore, we noted that only one city across all of the hard water regions included in the data had been projected to save £1,100, which we did not consider sufficient to substantiate the claim. For those reasons, we considered the projected savings data for the hard water regions across England were insufficient to demonstrate that consumers could save up to £1,100. We then assessed the UKWTA paper, which summarised a list of studies that analysed the effect of limescale on certain appliances, including gas and electric water heaters and the effect of energy consumption on these appliances after being descaled. One of the studies cited in the UKWTA paper stated 0.5 mm of hard scale increased fuel costs by 9.4%. The study was published in 1949, and we considered that heating systems and other appliances were likely to be more efficient now, compared to 1949. As such, we considered that study could not be used to calculate the projected energy savings after the installation of a Harvey Water Softener product. We also considered this study summarised its findings and was not a full study. Whilst it showed that descaling had a positive effect on energy consumption in appliances, without the full methodology or results, we were unable to properly assess it. Furthermore, the study did not specifically evaluate the products that Harvey Water Softeners sold. We therefore considered that the UKWTA paper was not sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of Harvey Water Softeners products or any subsequent energy and money savings claims. Harvey Water Softeners stated that the average UK household in a hard water area would gain 1.5 mm of limescale a year, and as such, it could equal savings of up to 28.2%. We understood that figure was reached by multiplying the estimated increased fuel cost (9.4% per 0.5 mm of limescale) by three to calculate the amount 1.5 mm of limescale would increase fuel costs by. Because that figure was based on projections which we did not consider to be sufficiently robust we considered it could not be cited to substantiate the savings claim in the ad. In any case, we noted that the savings projections of 28.2% shared by Harvey Water Softeners were smaller than the 30% figure cited in the ad. Consequently, we considered that the evidence shared was not sufficient to substantiate the savings claim in the ad, regardless of the accuracy of the projections. We also considered the amount of limescale build-up per household would depend on individual households’ water usage, the age of the pipes and where in the UK the house was located since some areas had higher amounts of hard water than others. Whilst a water softener was likely to provide some energy saving, we had not seen any evidence that water softeners had saved consumers up to £1,100 or reduced energy bills by up to 30%. We therefore concluded the claims “Save up to £1,100” and “Reduce your energy bills by up to 30%” were misleading.",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Harvey Water Softeners Ltd to not make savings claims in the absence of adequate substantiation.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/harvey-water-softeners-ltd-a23-1199615-harvey-water-softeners-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Mecca Bingo Ltd,,"An Instagram post for Mecca Bingo, seen on 16 August 2023, featured two images of the celebrity drag queen, Baga Chipz. In the image on the left, they were not smiling and were wearing plain, dark clothes, with no make-up. In the image on the right, they had a happy expression, were holding a champagne glass in the air, were wearing a red sequinned outfit, with matching jewellery, and had a full face of make-up. Text above both images stated “Before playing Mecca Bingo vs after playing Mecca Bingo”. A caption on the post stated “A good game can transform you! Don’t you just love that post-bingo glow. Over 18s only. BeGambleAware.org. DrinkAware.co.uk. Ts&Cs apply. #letaplaymeccabingo #meccabingo #winning #bingo #winningfeeling #feelinggood #bagachipz”.","Two complainants, who believed the ad suggested gambling could enhance a person’s self-image or self-esteem, challenged whether the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code.","Mecca Bingo Ltd believed the ad did not suggest gambling could improve personal qualities or enhance a person’s self-image or self-esteem. As well as offering bingo games, they said their goal was to provide customers with an exciting and entertaining experience. They said the purpose of the ad was therefore to convey that their services were fun and entertaining, with the post featuring the well-known drag queen Baga Chipz, who Mecca Bingo regularly worked closely with. They said the use of the “before and after” metaphor and the reference to having a “post bingo glow” reflected how a person may feel after a night at Mecca Bingo, and the modification of appearance was not an indication of enhanced personal qualities, self-image or self-esteem. They said the post included the word “transform”’ to convey this sense of enjoyment and because references to transformations were common in the drag entertainment industry. They said Baga Chipz rose to fame on the TV show Ru Paul’s Drag Race UK, which regularly used this language, and that viewers of the ad would be aware of that context and therefore would not take any reference to transformation literally. They believed viewers would consider the difference between the two images of Baga Chipz reflected a highly exaggerated portrayal of the emotions a person would have after enjoying the entertaining environment of a Mecca Bingo venue. Mecca Bingo said they deliberately omitted any reference to winning at bingo to ensure they avoided suggesting that the “feel good” factor of bingo only came from winning. They said the reference to having a “good game” was intended to refer to the positive experience and atmosphere of Mecca Bingo venues and the benefits brought by the social interaction people had when attending. They said there was nothing in the ad which suggested winning at bingo would give someone a sense of positive recognition, admiration or superiority. They acknowledged that the ad could have been misinterpreted if viewed without understanding it in its full context. They said they recognised the importance and requirements of the CAP Code and would ensure that future marketing including social media posts conveyed their messaging more clearly. They confirmed they had permanently removed the post.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that ads for gambling must be socially responsible and must not suggest that gambling can enhance personal qualities, for example, that it can improve self-image or self-esteem, or is a way to gain control, superiority, recognition or admiration. The ASA noted the image on the left featured an individual with a blank facial expression, neutral stance, and dark clothing and who we considered was presented in a way in which displayed little emotion. This contrasted the image on the right, which showed the same individual with a happier facial expression while also wearing a full face of makeup. We also considered the addition of a raised champagne glass and brighter, more exuberant clothes, in the form of a sequinned outfit with matching jewellery, presented that person as having a higher level of confidence and an enhanced self-image in comparison to the same person in the image on the left. We considered the text above the image on the left, which stated “Before playing Mecca Bingo” and the text above the image on the right, which stated “vs after playing Mecca Bingo”, implied that an individual would achieve that higher self-image by playing bingo. We also considered that the caption on the post, “A good game can transform you! Don’t you just love that post-bingo glow” and the hashtags, “winning, “winningfeeling” and “feelingood” created an impression that an individual could improve their self-esteem, as well as their self-image, by not just playing bingo related games, but also by winning them. We acknowledged that the ad featured well-known drag queen Baga Chipz and that the two images, combined with a reference to being transformed, would have been interpreted by some viewers to be a reference about drag queens. We still considered the overall impression of the ad, particularly through the contrasting images, suggested gambling could improve an individual’s self-image or self-esteem. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad suggested gambling could enhance a person’s self-image or self-esteem, which was irresponsible and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1 and 16.3.6 (Gambling).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Naked Wolfe Ltd,,"A paid-for Facebook ad, for Naked Wolfe, a clothing retailer, seen in September 2023, featured a female model dressed in a short black skirt, a black cropped top and platform soled black sandals. She was pictured sitting on the floor against a white background.","Three complainants, who believed the model appeared unhealthily thin, challenged whether the ad was irresponsible.",Naked Wolfe Ltd did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. Facebook acknowledged the complaints and said they would await the outcome of the investigation.,"Upheld The ASA was concerned by Naked Wolfe Ltd’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The model was featured sitting on the floor with her left leg crossed over and her right pointed at the camera. Whilst it was not possible to see the model’s whole left leg, we considered the model’s lower legs appeared to be thin, and that was particularly emphasised by her thick, black shoes. Furthermore, the model was seen leaning forward, and we considered that position, which created shadow across the model’s waist, accentuated its slimness. Additionally, we considered the styling of the model, in a crop top and high-waisted skirt, drew particular attention to her exposed midriff, which further emphasised her narrow waist. We also considered the model’s position, leaning forward with her head towards the camera, made her head appear larger than the rest of her body, in a manner which made her appear unhealthily thin. Because the pose and styling strongly emphasised the slimness of the model’s legs and waist we considered the ad gave the impression that the model was unhealthily thin and concluded the ad was irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Responsible advertising).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Naked Wolfe Ltd to ensure that the images in their ads were prepared responsibly and did not portray their models as being unhealthily thin. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/naked-wolfe-ltd-G23-1212005.html
ASA Ruling on Nimaya Mindstation Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on long COVID treatments, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 30 August and 8 November 2023.","A website and Instagram post for Nimaya, a health and wellness clinic: a. The website www.nimaya.co, seen on 26 June 2023, listed various health conditions including “Long Covid” on the “A-Z Conditions” web page. When that linked text was clicked, a box appeared with text that stated “Long Covid recommended therapies (click to view each therapy and book) Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Red Light Therapy Bed”. On the “Hyberbaric Oxygen Therapy” linked web page, text included “Benefits Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy has been found to be helpful in treating the symptoms of the following conditions; […] For Your Mind Eases migraine […] Can improve symptoms of Autism and Multiple Sclerosis Helps with recovery after a Stroke […] For Your Body Helps with recovery from Long Covid […] Slows degenerative joint disease Improves symptoms of Osteoporosis”. On the “Advanced Red Light Therapy” linked web page, text stated “Benefits Advanced Red Light therapy has been found to be helpful in treating the symptoms of the following conditions; For Your Body Helps recovery from Long Covid symptoms”. b. The post on Nimaya’s Instagram page, posted 14 March 2023, stated “nimayalondon 15 AMAZING reasons why YOU need to book a HYPERBARIC OXYGEN session now! […] it helps recovery from Long Covid […] eases migraines […] improves respiratory conditions […] increases recovery after a Stroke”.","The ASA challenged whether the: 1. claims in ads (a) and (b) that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and advanced red light therapy treatment could treat long COVID were misleading and could be substantiated; and 2. ads discouraged essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought, namely migraine, autism, multiple sclerosis, stroke, degenerative joint disease, osteoporosis and respiratory conditions.","1. Nimaya Mindstation Ltd t/a Nimaya denied that the ads were misleading in claiming that HBOT and red light therapy (photobiomodulation) helped with recovery from long COVID. They said they held documentary evidence in the form of clinical studies from both manufacturers of the HBOT chamber and of the red light therapy equipment, which they provided to their customers via their website. They believed they showed the treatments to be beneficial in helping with recovery from many of the symptoms of long COVID. They provided evidence which included studies related to the use of HBOT and red light therapy which they believed supported the claims in the ads. 2. Nimaya said they did not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. Neither ad (a) nor (b) made any claim that HBOT replaced the requirement for medical supervision. Their website stated “As with all therapies, the effectiveness of this treatment is likely to be different for everyone and it is suggested that you carry out your own research into the benefits offered”. It also recommended the reader to visit their Resources page that offered a number of links to studies and research for their own information and review. They said all HBOT treatments were carried out by a person suitably trained and qualified to conduct treatment with HBOT, who had completed the required safety training and instruction certification courses required by the manufacturers to operate their HBOT chambers. They provided copies of those qualifications. Nimaya said no diagnosis as to a medical condition was ever made and they did not seek to advise as to a client’s condition. They only offered a treatment service and every client who underwent HBOT treatment was required to have an induction session that lasted around 1.5 hours, during which it was made clear that the treatment was not a replacement for medical treatment with a doctor. In their treatment waiver, which was signed by each customer, it stated that “Nimaya Mindstation treatment is not a medical or psychological therapy and is not intended as a treatment or remedy for any condition”. It also required customers to state: “I also hereby agree and understand that I shall have consulted with my own doctor prior to having a Nimaya Treatment if I am currently taking any medication or under a doctor's care for any reason, or if I have or ought to have any reason for consulting my doctor before using the treatments offered by Nimaya Mindstation Ltd. I understand that Nimaya Mindstation does not medically diagnose or claim to cure and that their treatments aim to stimulate the body’s own healing mechanisms”.","1. Upheld Ad (a) stated “Long Covid recommended therapies […] Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Red Light Therapy Bed”, “Benefits Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy has been found to be helpful in treating the symptoms of the following conditions […] For Your Body Helps with recovery from Long Covid and “Advanced Red Light therapy has been found to be helpful in treating the symptoms of the following conditions; For Your Body Helps recovery from Long Covid symptoms”. Ad (b) stated “15 AMAZING reasons why YOU need to book a HYPERBARIC OXYGEN session now! […] it helps recovery from Long Covid”. The ASA considered consumers would understand from the claims that HBOT and advanced red light therapy could treat long COVID and its symptoms. We therefore expected to see robust scientific evidence to substantiate the claims. We understood from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website that long COVID was a multi-system condition with a range of debilitating symptoms. Its signs and symptoms continued or developed after acute COVID-19, continued for more than 4 weeks and were not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Long COVID may consist of a number of distinct syndromes, which could include post-ICU syndrome, post-viral fatigue syndrome, long-term COVID syndrome and permanent organ damage. We also understood that HBOT involved breathing 100% (pure) oxygen in a special pressurised chamber and that red light therapy was a non-invasive low energy light (red and near infrared) therapy. We first assessed the evidence provided for red light therapy which included two literature reviews, two systematic reviews and an abstract of a literature review. The two literature reviews and two systematic reviews related to the use of red light therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 and not long COVID. The abstract discussed the effects of the microbiome and red light therapy on human health generally. Therefore, we did not consider that the evidence provided was relevant to substantiate the claims in the ads about the treatment of long COVID. We next assessed the evidence supplied for the HBOT treatment, which included two studies and a news article. We did not consider that the news article, which discussed one of the study’s results of using HBOT in patients with long COVID, met the standard of evidence we required for the type of claims being made. The first published study, which involved giving ten HBOT sessions over a 12-day period to ten patients with long COVID related fatigue symptoms, measured the change in fatigue and cognitive profile. The results showed a statistically significant improvement to both fatigue and some cognitive outcome measures. However, because the number of participants in the study was small, there was no control group and it was not blinded, we considered that it did not meet the standard of evidence we expected to see. Furthermore, there was no follow-up to assess whether or not any of the measured improvements following HBOT were sustained. We considered that the study was insufficient to substantiate the claims in ads (a) and (b). The second study was a randomised, controlled, double-blind trial which evaluated the effect of HBOT in 73 post COVID-19 patients with ongoing symptoms, and in particular their neurocognitive function. Patients received either 40 daily HBOT or sham sessions within a two-month period. Follow-up assessments were performed at baseline and 1–3 weeks after the last treatment session. In those who were treated with HBOT, compared to the control group, there were significant improvements in the primary outcome, which was the global cognitive score, and the attention and executive function domains, but not in the memory, information processing speed and motor skills domains. Whilst there were also some significant improvements in the HBOT group, compared to the control group, for a number of the secondary outcomes that were assessed using self-reported questionnaires that related to quality of life, sleep, psychological distress and pain, many of the specific domains were not significantly improved. We considered that although there were significant improvements in some specific areas of both the primary and secondary outcome measures, there were also areas, which in some instances were closely related to the improved areas, where improvement was not seen. There were also limitations with the study. We considered that the number of participants in the study was small and the results were obtained 1‒3 weeks after the last HBOT session, after which there was no follow-up to assess whether any of the measured improvements following HBOT were sustained. Additionally, the study stated that the optimal number of HBOT sessions to achieve maximal therapeutic effect was yet to be determined. For the reasons stated, we considered that the study was insufficient to substantiate the claims in the ads that HBOT could treat long COVID and its symptoms. Therefore, because we had not seen adequate evidence to substantiate the efficacy claims that HBOT and advanced red light therapy could treat long COVID and its symptoms, we concluded that the ads were misleading. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).  2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketers must not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. Advertisers must not offer specific advice on diagnosis of or treatment for such conditions, unless that advice, diagnosis or treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. Ad (a) stated “Benefits Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy has been found to be helpful in treating the symptoms of the following conditions; […] For Your Mind Eases migraine […] Can improve symptoms of Autism and Multiple Sclerosis Helps with recovery after a Stroke […] For Your Body […] Slows degenerative joint disease Improves symptoms of Osteoporosis”. Ad (b) stated “why YOU need to book a HYPERBARIC OXYGEN session now! […] eases migraines […] improves respiratory conditions […] increases recovery after a Stroke”. We considered migraine, autism, multiple sclerosis, stroke, degenerative joint disease, osteoporosis and respiratory conditions were conditions for which medical supervision should be sought, and therefore advice, diagnosis or treatment should be conducted under the supervision of a suitably-qualified health professional. We considered the claims relating to those conditions in ads (a) and (b) would be understood by consumers to mean that Nimaya offered specific treatment for each of those conditions. We understood that customers were required to sign a disclaimer stating that they had consulted their own doctor prior to receiving treatment and the website also featured disclaimers advising customers to carry out their own research. However, that did not negate Nimaya’s responsibilities to demonstrate that the treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified health professional. The evidence they provided was in the form of two certificates that demonstrated the person awarded the certificates had been trained and given instructions about the operation and safe use of hyperbaric chambers. We did not consider that evidence demonstrated that the treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified health professional. Because Nimaya had not supplied evidence that showed their HBOT treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional, we concluded that the ads discouraged essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought and therefore breached the Code. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.2 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",Ads (a) and (b) must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Nimaya Mindstation Ltd t/a Nimaya not to state or imply that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) or advanced red light therapy could treat long COVID or its symptoms unless they held adequate evidence that substantiated those claims. We also told them to ensure their future ads did not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/nimaya-mindstation-ltd-A23-1199223.html
ASA Ruling on Norfolk Dinosaur Park Ltd t/a PrimEvil,,"A poster for PrimEvil, a horror-themed Halloween event at Norfolk Dinosaur Park, seen in Norwich in September 2023, featured text that stated “SCREAMING WON’T HELP […] Welcome to the hell we now call home” and an image of a person with a severe head wound whose flesh, nose and lips appeared to have rotted away from the bone.","The complainants, some of whose children had found the ad distressing, challenged whether it was likely to cause fear and distress, and was inappropriate for display in an untargeted medium.","Norfolk Dinosaur Park Ltd explained that PrimEvil which was targeted at a teenage and adult audience, was an annual Halloween event that typically attracted 24,000 visitors over its 16-night run. They said the ad featured an illustration of a zombie and referred to a previous ASA ruling on a previous Norkfolk Dinosaur Park ad in which a similar image was found to be in breach of the Code. They said the ad under investigation was distinguishable from the previous ad because the character in that instance had been depicted in an aggressive manner while carrying a weapon, whereas the zombie had not. They highlighted the ad did not feature any violence or threat in the artwork used and was in line with similar visuals used at Halloween. Norfolk Dinosaur Park said they had taken great care to ensure the ad had been placed away from areas where young children might congregate, such as near schools or on school run routes. Clear Channel said their terms and conditions required that advertisers whose ads they carried were responsible for compliance with all relevant codes and laws of advertising. Clear Channel said that it was not for them to decide if the campaign was suitable for publication. Notwithstanding that, they applied a prohibition to the ad campaign to ensure that it was not played within 100 metres of any schools.","Upheld The ASA noted the ad had appeared at a poster site on a high street, and seven of the complainants had reported their children becoming distressed by the image. We acknowledged Norfolk Dinosaur Park’s comments that the character in the ad did not carry a weapon and was not displayed in a violent or threatening pose, and that the ad had been placed away from schools. However, we noted the character had realistic, recognisably human features, and that their flesh had rotted away to the bone, leaving blackened decomposing tissue, an exposed nasal cavity, and exposed teeth and gums. The character also had a large head wound, and blood from the wound ran down the side of their face. The character’s face was staring out, towards the viewer. We considered the image was likely to distress young children, and that it was unsuitable for display where it was likely to be seen by them, particularly, but not only, in combination with the text “PRIMEVIL SCREAMING WON’T HELP!”, which was presented as though written in blood. We therefore concluded the ad had breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.2 (Harm and offence).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Norfolk Dinosaur Park Ltd to ensure that future marketing that was likely to cause fear or distress to young children did not appear where they were likely to see it.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/norfolk-dinosaur-park-ltd-g23-1213263-norfolk-dinosaur-park-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on SpiderfarmerLED,,"An in-app ad for Spider Farmer UK, an indoor gardening and artificial lighting retailer, seen in the Google Chrome app on 23 August 2023, featured an image of cannabis plants growing under an artificial lightning rig and text that stated “Spider Farmer UK Summar Sale. Spider Farmer UK official website. Providing all kind of kits for indoor growing”.","The complainant challenged whether the ad, which they believed condoned the cultivation of cannabis plants, was irresponsible.","SpiderfarmerLED (Spider Farmer UK) did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. Google UK Ltd said Google Ireland confirmed the ad had been served through the Google Ads platform, which was a self-administered system. Under their terms and conditions, responsibility for following the applicable regulations and guidance, including the CAP code, lay with the advertiser. They said that the ad was in breach of Google’s policies and they had taken steps to prevent it from being served again.","Upheld The ASA was concerned by SpiderfarmerLED’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. We understood the cultivation of cannabis plants was illegal in the UK. The ad depicted cannabis plants being grown indoors under artificial lighting, which we considered suggested Spider Farmer UK’s indoor gardening equipment and lighting could be used in their cultivation and production. We therefore considered the ad condoned the cultivation of cannabis plants. For that reason, we concluded the ad was socially irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told SpiderfarmerLED t/a Spider Farmer UK to ensure their ads were not socially irresponsible and did not condone the use of their products in the cultivation of cannabis plants.

ASA Ruling on Studiocanal Ltd t/a Studiocanal,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, one of which was Upheld; the other was informally resolved.","Two video on demand (VOD) ads for the horror film Evil Dead Rise, seen in April 2023: a. The first ad featured two children saying “Mom?” and watching a bathtub with accompanying suspenseful music. A pair of hands suddenly grabbed the bath rim, and a woman with reddened eyes and a dirt-smeared face slowly emerged, saying “Mommy’s with the maggots now”. The ad also featured shots of a woman crawling, convulsing, and arching her back with the sound of crunching bones, saying “Don’t let it take my babies”, and shots of her eyes rolling back and flickering. In the final scene a young girl gingerly approached a locked door on a latch. A woman behind it suddenly reached through the gap and grabbed the child by the throat, screaming. b. The second ad showed the same woman grabbing the child by the throat, and also crawling out over the edge of a bathtub onto the floor. It featured shots of characters with blood on their face, a person being grabbed and dragged backwards while screaming, and another person holding a chainsaw, as well as images of limbs with blood on them. Another scene showed a person standing in the shadows pointing at four cowering children and saying “eeny, meany, miny, mo”.",The ASA received eight complaints. The complainants challenged whether the ads were unduly distressing.,"StudioCanal Ltd said both ads were submitted to Clearcast for clearance and that a post-9 pm timing restriction to the VOD ads had been applied, which related to risk of harm. They said a further restriction, regarding content that might cause physical mental or moral harm to children and/or action that, if emulated, could cause danger or harm to children, was also applied. It required the ads were not placed in or adjacent to programmes commissioned for, principally directed at or likely to appeal to children under 16 years of age. StudioCanal Ltd said they had contacted the service providers of the platforms on which the ads appeared, to ensure they were aware of the Clearcast restrictions. They said that although each platform used different means, measures were taken by each to preclude the advertisements from being targeted towards viewers under the age of 18. Channel 4 said the ads were approved by Clearcast as compliant to the Code of Broadcast Advertising (BCAP Code), which was the clearance standard Channel 4 applied to ads served on their streaming service. They said Clearcast’s restrictions were applied in Channel 4’s internal systems, including the post-9 pm restriction and excluding placement within or adjacent to programmes targeted at or likely to appeal to children under 16. They said those restrictions had prevented the ads from being served to persons below the age of 16, as well as helping to keep them from viewers who could find the content overly distressing. Channel 5 said the ad was approved by Clearcast for their online service, My5 and Sky Media (their third-party sales house) had ensured that Clearcast’s post-9 pm restriction was in place, and that the ads were not served around programmes aimed at children. Sky said the ads had appeared on Sky Glass in April and had been given a post-9 pm restriction by Clearcast, who they relied on to rate advertising shown across their platforms. ITV said that the restrictions imposed by Clearcast including the post-9 pm timing had been applied to the ads. They had also taken steps to ensure that the ad was not placed during any family viewing after 9 pm.","Upheld The ads were comprised of material from the 18-rated horror film Evil Dead Rise, and the scenes that featured had supernatural themes and were set in dark, eerie surroundings. There were also tense sound effects throughout. The ads contained several suspenseful sequences which built into moments of high drama and alarm, including a scene in ad (a) in which two children apprehensively watched a bathtub, when hands suddenly grabbed the bath rim and a woman with a deathly appearance and voice emerged. In another scene in ads (a) and (b) a young girl gingerly approached a door on a latch and said “Mom?”, and a woman who was behind the door grabbed her by the throat through the gap and screamed manically. The woman was also shown crawling across the floor and convulsing with cracking bone sound effects, and close up shots showed her eyes flickering and rolling back. Additionally, the ads featured various shots of characters, including children, who were frightened, screaming or crying, and some shots in ad (b) showed their faces and limbs covered in blood. We considered that the ads were unsuitable for children because they contained content which was likely to cause them fear and distress, particularly young children. We understood the ads had been cleared by Clearcast with a post-9 pm timing restriction, and restrictions around programming principally directed to, or with appeal to, children under 16 had also been applied. We considered those restrictions were sufficient to ensure that the ads’ exposure to children was limited. We also considered whether the ads were likely to cause undue distress to adults who viewed them. Several complainants believed they were too distressing and had found them frightening and shocking, particularly because they had appeared during programming on video on demand (VOD) services which did not contain similar content or themes to the horror film Evil Dead Rise. The ads had appeared on VOD services after 9 pm when the audience was predominantly adult. However, we considered that their strong horror content was not suitable for general viewing. They required very careful targeting during programming in which the content may be more anticipated, such as material that contained similar themes to the advertised horror film. Because the ads contained images and a level of jeopardy that was not suitable for general audiences, even after 9 pm, we concluded that the level of restriction applied had not been appropriate and the ads were, therefore, likely to cause unjustifiable fear and distress to some viewers. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.2 (Harm and offence).","The ads, in their current form, must not be scheduled to appear on VOD services again within programming for general viewing at any time. We told StudioCanal Ltd that more care must be taken in future to ensure similar ads do not cause unjustifiable fear and distress to viewers.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/studiocanal-ltd-g23-1195126-studiocanal-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on TMS Legal Ltd,,"Two paid-for TikTok posts by TMS Legal, a legal firm specialising in financial claims, were seen on 27 April 2023: (a) The first post showed a cheque for £3,543. The cheque contained the text “For and on behalf of Merton Europe Limited”. A narrator stated, “Did you buy your car on finance through the lender Moneybarn before the year 2019? … So I just got £3,543 cheque … If you are like me and struggled to make your car payments to Moneybarn, you may have been mis-sold the loan and you are eligible for a refund … Just click the link below and start your claim.” Below the video was the logo for TMS legal and the name “TMS Legal”. (b) The second post featured a video of a man who said, “Did you have your credit limit increased by Vanquis?” The video then showed a cheque for £4,121. The cheque contained the text “For and on behalf of Merton Europe Limited”. The man stated, “So I got this £4,121 cheque … If you are like me and Vanquis raised your credit limit and you struggled to make monthly payments, you may have been mis-sold and are eligible for a refund … Just click the link below to start your claim.” Below the video was the same logo and name for TMS legal that was in ad (a). ","Vanquis Banking Group PLC challenged whether the ads were misleading, because they implied the testimonials featured were from genuine Moneybarn No.1 Ltd and Vanquis Bank Ltd customers.","TMS Legal Ltd said the ads did not contain genuine customer testimonials and the people in the videos were actors. They told us that their marketing agency, without TMS Legal’s knowledge, prepared the ads in an attempt to provide representative testimonials and average compensation sums that their customers received. However, due to an internal oversight, the ads were published in error. They explained that it was not a systemic issue, and acknowledged that the ads could be deemed misleading without qualification to explain that the individuals were actors rather than customers providing genuine testimonials. They stated that their internal systems had now been strengthened, to avoid the same thing happening again. They told us that both ads had already been proactively removed on 21 and 22 June 2023.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketers must hold documentary evidence that a testimonial or endorsement used in a marketing communication is genuine, unless it is obviously fictitious. Further to that claims that are likely to be interpreted as factual and appear in a testimonial must not mislead or be likely to mislead the consumer. The individuals in ads (a) and (b) stated, in a casual, conversational manner, that they had received a cheque as compensation from the companies cited. We considered that consumers would understand from the ads that the individuals were genuine customers and that the person in ad (a) was paid a cheque for £3,543 by Moneybarn No 1 Ltd, and the person in ad (b) was paid a cheque of £4,121 by Vanquis Bank Ltd. We had not seen evidence to show that the sums represented in the cheques were average compensation sums paid to TMS Legal. However, because the ads gave the overall impression that the testimonials were genuine and the individuals in the ads had been paid the amounts advertised when that was not the case, we concluded that they were misleading. The ads breached CAP Code 3.1 (Misleading Advertising), 3.45, 3.47 (Endorsements and Testimonials), and 3.7 (Substantiation).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told TMS Legal Ltd to ensure that their future ads did not imply testimonials were genuine if that was not the case.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/tms-legal-ltd-A23-1199376.html
ASA Ruling on The Heal Air,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on long COVID treatments, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 30 August and 8 November 2023. Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, one of which was Upheld. The other was informally resolved after the advertiser agreed to amend their advertising. ","A website, Facebook post and Instagram post for The Heal-Air, a hyperbaric oxygen therapy provider: a. The website www.thehealair.co.uk, seen on 26 June 2023, stated on the homepage “Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) can help treat a wide range of conditions including Long Covid […]”. Under the heading “Core Treatments” text stated “Long Covid” with a button to “FIND OUT MORE”. On the “Long Covid” web page text stated “Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy may help alliviate [sic] the symptoms of Long Covid. The severity of COVID-19 can lead to hypoxemia as a result of damage done to lungs through inflammatory responses by the viral infection in the respiratory system. Hyperbaric Oxygen contributes to reverse hypoxemia. In addition, helps [sic] to reduce any leftover inflammation caused by Covid-19, repair any damaged cells starved of oxygen during illness, improve energy levels and reduce pain in the body from inflammation. It’s also possible that small traces of the covid [sic] virus are left in the body and these can be killed off by improved immune functioning that HBOT can deliver”. “Other benefits include: Improving many of the pulmonary, neurological and cardiological symptoms Restoring the biological balance of the cell”. Further text stated “How many sessions will I need? Customers have seen improvements from as little as one session in a hyperbaric chamber with long term recovery being apparent in most between 10-40 sessions”. Below were links to “Clinical Research” and “Media Reports” related to the treatment of Long Covid using hyperbaric oxygen therapy. b. The Facebook post on The Heal-Air page, posted 20 April 2023, stated “Health Conditions Alleviate your Symptoms […] Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy may help: Long Covid […]”. c. The Instagram post on The Heal-Air page, also posted 20 April 2023, was the same as ad (b).","The ASA challenged whether the claims in ads (a), (b) and (c) that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) could treat long COVID were misleading and could be substantiated. ","The Heal-Air said they did not use the wording “can treat” in their posts. Instead they said “may” to acknowledge that the effectiveness of HBOT may vary among individuals. They had added a disclaimer to every page on their website, following notification of the complaint, that The Heal-Air did not make any inferences or claims regarding the efficacy or benefits of HBOT and there was no intention implied or otherwise of it being a cure or as being preventative of any disease. It also stated that results could vary and that evidence for its use remained uncertain as it had not been proven through a randomised controlled clinical experiment or trial, the strongest form of scientific evidence by conventional medical standards. The Heal-Air said that during consultations with their customers, they clearly explained that they did not provide any guarantees of treatment outcomes, which was included in their consultation form, along with their terms and conditions. They provided a copy of their terms and conditions. They also provided evidence which included clinical trials that they said showed promising outcomes for individuals suffering from long COVID. The clinic director said they suffered from long COVID and saw improvements in their health after using HBOT. They would make changes to their website, including deleting the long COVID web page, as a result of the ASA investigation. ","Upheld The Heal-Air website (ad (a)) stated “Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) can help treat a wide range of conditions including Long Covid” and “Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy may help alliviate [sic] the symptoms of Long Covid […] Hyperbaric Oxygen contributes to improve energy levels and reduce pain in the body from inflammation […] Other benefits include: Improving many of the pulmonary, neurological and cardiological symptoms Restoring the biological balance of the cell”. Ads (b) and (c) stated “Health Conditions Alleviate your Symptoms […] Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy may help: Long Covid […]”. The ASA considered consumers would understand the ads to mean that HBOT could treat long COVID and alleviate its symptoms. We further considered that they would understand from ad (a) that HBOT could reduce pain caused by inflammation, improve energy levels as well as improve symptoms affecting the heart and cardiac function, brain and nerves. We therefore expected to see robust scientific evidence to substantiate the claims. We understood from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website that long COVID was a multi-system condition with a range of debilitating symptoms. Its signs and symptoms continued or developed after acute COVID-19, continued for more than 4 weeks and were not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Long COVID may consist of a number of distinct syndromes, which could include post-ICU syndrome, post-viral fatigue syndrome, long-term COVID syndrome and permanent organ damage. We also understood that HBOT involved breathing 100% (pure) oxygen in a special pressurised chamber. We assessed the evidence provided which included two studies and three abstracts of studies. The studies, to which two of the abstracts related, assessed the use of HBOT to treat patients with COVID-19 and not long COVID. We therefore considered that those studies were not relevant to substantiate the claims related to long COVID in the ads. The third abstract related to a case study on the use of HBOT to treat six patients who had long COVID. Although we had not seen the case study in full, we considered that in any case, results could not be drawn from such small patient sizes and that a case study did not meet the standard of evidence required for the type of claims being made. The first published study, which involved giving ten HBOT sessions over a 12-day period to ten patients with long COVID related fatigue symptoms, measured the change in fatigue and cognitive profile. The results showed a statistically significant improvement to both fatigue and some cognitive outcome measures. However, because the number of participants in the study was small, there was no control group and it was not blinded, we considered that it did not meet the standard of evidence we expected to see. Furthermore, there was no follow-up to assess whether any of the measured improvements following HBOT were sustained. We considered that the study was insufficient to substantiate the claims in ads (a), (b) and (c). The second study was a randomised, controlled, double-blind trial which evaluated the effect of HBOT in 73 post COVID-19 patients with ongoing symptoms, and in particular their neurocognitive function. Patients received either 40 daily HBOT or sham sessions within a two-month period. Follow-up assessments were performed at baseline and 1–3 weeks after the last treatment session. In those who were treated with HBOT, compared to the control group, there were significant improvements in the primary outcome which was the global cognitive score and the attention and executive function domains, but not in the memory, information processing speed and motor skills domains. Whilst there were also some significant improvements in the HBOT group, compared to the control group, for a number of the secondary outcomes that were assessed using self-reported questionnaires that related to quality of life, sleep, psychological distress and pain, many of the specific domains were not significantly improved. Additionally, there was no significant improvement in their pulmonary function. We considered that although there were significant improvements in some specific areas of both the primary and secondary outcome measures, there were also areas, which in some instances were closely related to the improved areas, where improvement was not seen. There were also limitations with the study. We considered that the number of participants in the study was small and the results were obtained 1‒3 weeks after the last HBOT session. Also, there was no follow-up to assess whether or not any of the measured improvements following HBOT were sustained. For the reasons stated, we therefore considered that the study was insufficient to substantiate the claims in the ads. Ad (a) also stated “How many sessions will I need? Customers have seen improvements from as little as one session in a hyperbaric chamber with long term recovery being apparent in most between 10-40 sessions”. The studies provided involved giving patients 10 and 40 HBOT sessions, respectively. Notwithstanding that we did not consider that either study was sufficient to substantiate that HBOT could treat long COVID or its symptoms, we also had not seen evidence which demonstrated that HBOT was effective after only one session. Additionally, the study involving 40 HBOT sessions stated that the optimal number of HBOT sessions to achieve maximal therapeutic effect was yet to be determined. Furthermore, as neither study followed patients up for a prolonged period after the treatment, we considered that the evidence did not substantiate that long-term improvements could be achieved with HBOT. While we welcomed The Heal-Air’s willingness to make changes to their ads, because we had not seen adequate evidence to substantiate the efficacy claims that HBOT could treat long COVID or certain symptoms of it, and that patients would experience long-term recovery, we concluded that the ads were misleading. Ads (a), (b) and (c) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). ","Ads (a), (b) and (c) must not appear again in the form complained of. We told The Heal-Air Ltd not to state or imply that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) could treat long COVID or certain symptoms of it unless they held adequate evidence that substantiated those claims.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/the-heal-air-A23-1199221.html
ASA Ruling on WHM Hair Transplant and Aesthetics t/a WHM Clinic,"In June 2023 the United Nations confirmed that, following a request from their government, that the Republic of Turkey would henceforth be identified as the Republic of Türkiye. Although the change has been implemented, we have used the former here because it is currently more commonly understood by consumers. This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on cosmetic surgery abroad. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules. Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad for Whmclinictr, promoting cosmetic surgery in Turkey, seen in May 2023, featured the caption “[…] WHM Clinic offers you the opportunity to turn your operation into a vacation! 5-star hotel, VIP transportation, personal translator […]. Everything is included in the work procedures and is carried out according to international standards and in a completely transparent way. Fill in the form now and don’t miss the opportunity”. An illustration underneath was headed “WHAT IS A TUMMY TUCK?” and “CHECK HOW MUCH YOU CAN SAVE ABROAD”, and featured a person with a rounded tummy and several bullet points describing “BENEFITS OF TUMMY TUCK”. One of the benefits was “INCREASED BODY CONFIDENCE”. An additional image visible when swiping to the right compared the price, in Euros, of tummy tuck surgery in different countries, with Turkey at the cheapest price of €1,950.","The ASA challenged whether the ad: 1. reference to “INCREASED BODY CONFIDENCE” as a benefit of a tummy tuck was irresponsible because it exploited insecurities surrounding body image; 2. including the reference to “the opportunity to turn your operation into a vacation!”, trivialised the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery and was therefore irresponsible; and 3. misleadingly omitted information regarding the need for a pre-consultation to assess the patient’s potential contraindications and suitability for the procedures, including where such pre-consultation would take place.","1., 2. & 3. WHM Hair Transplant and Aesthetics t/a Whmclinictr did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. Meta said they did not have any comments.","Upheld The ASA was concerned by WHM Hair Transplant and Aesthetics t/a Whmclinictr/WHM Clinic's lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. 1. Upheld The ad featured an illustration that listed several “BENEFITS OF TUMMY TUCK”, such as “REMOVAL OF EXCESS FAT AND SKIN” and “REDUCTION IN VISIBLE STRETCH MARKS”. The illustration further included a reference to “INCREASED BODY CONFIDENCE” as one of those benefits. We considered that the association of an increase in confidence with obtaining a tummy tuck implied that having a body that did not conform to prevailing beauty standards of slimness or had visible stretch marks, was a source of concern, because it would impact self-confidence, and that it could be rectified by surgery. We therefore considered that the ad was likely to encourage consumers to focus on concerns about their bodies as a reason for cosmetic surgery and therefore that the ad exploited those insecurities. We concluded that the ad was therefore socially irresponsible. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Responsible advertising). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required marketing communications to be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The ad included references to “the opportunity to turn your operation into a vacation!” and “CHECK HOW MUCH YOU CAN SAVE ABROAD”. It also gave emphasis to items of the cosmetic surgery package which people would closely associate with holidays such as: “5-star hotel” and “VIP transportation”. We considered that the ad was not likely to be interpreted as promoting a holiday; rather, its purpose was clear that it was for cosmetic surgery abroad. However, because the overall tone of the ad, and particularly the wording in the caption, focused on the travel, it was likely to detract from the seriousness of the surgery offered. It was also relevant that the surgery would take place abroad which raised the potential for additional risks, such as: whether the doctors and treatment providers would have the same standards of care and safety as in the UK; and how any arrangements for follow-up care and dealing with any complications which arose would be managed. We considered that the ad could be interpreted as suggesting that surgery was a decision that could be undertaken lightly as part of a holiday, without serious consideration of the nature of the intervention. We therefore concluded that the overall presentation of the ad was likely to be seen as trivialising cosmetic surgery. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility). 3. Upheld The CAP Guidance on cosmetic interventions stated that marketers should not imply that invasive surgery was a “minor procedure” or similar if that claim was likely to mislead as to the complexity or duration of the operation, the pain experienced either during or after the operation, the length of the recovery time or the potential side-effects. Ads should not mislead as to the likely commitment required for pre-consultation, surgery, recovery and post-operative assessments. Aside from referencing that the clinic was based in Turkey, the ad contained no further details about the procedure or the location where it would take place. The ad omitted information regarding the need for a pre-consultation to assess the patient’s potential contraindications and suitability for a tummy tuck, including where such a pre-consultation would take place. We understood that a pre-consultation would be necessary in order to discuss the patient’s concerns and suitability for the procedure, outline the complexity or duration of the operation, the pain during or after the operation, the length of recovery time and the potential risks and side effects. While we had not received a response from the advertiser, we understood it was likely that pre-consultation might sometimes need to take place in person rather than remotely. We considered that in the context of an ad for cosmetic surgery abroad, information regarding the necessity for a pre-consultation and where it would take place was material information necessary for consumers to make a considered decision and should have been included in the ad. Because that material information was not included we considered that the ad was misleading. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising).","The ad must not appear again in the form investigated. We told WHM Hair Transplant and Aesthetics t/a Whmclinictr/WHM Clinic to ensure their future ads were socially responsible, by not exploiting insecurities about body image and not trivialising the decision to undergo cosmetic surgery. We also told them not to mislead consumers by omitting material information regarding cosmetic surgery procedures abroad and the need for a pre-consultation, including where it would take place.

ASA Ruling on ZING Oral Care Ltd,,"A website and a paid-for Facebook ad for ZING toothpaste: a. The website www.zingtoothpaste.com, seen on 31 May June 2023, featured a home page headed “What you need to know about ‘white’ toothpaste. You shouldn’t have to brush with suspected carcinogens”. Text below stated “If it’s White, it ain’t Right. Toothpaste isn't naturally white. Many common toothpastes use an ingredient to make them look 'white'. This ingredient is called Titanium Dioxide. It's in things like paint. Titanium Dioxide is a suspected carcinogen, and banned in food by the European Food Safety Authority. However, it remains an ingredient in many common 'white' toothpastes. […] That's why ZING is clear. Free from Titanium Dioxide. Free from dodgy dyes. Because you shouldn't have to brush with suspected carcinogens”. b. The paid-for Facebook ad, seen on 30 June 2023, stated “No dodgy dyes. No supermarket nasties. Free from Titanium Dioxide forever"". An image embedded in the ad featured superimposed text that stated “No dodgy dyes. Titanium Dioxide-free […] f*ck cancer a clear gel"".","The complainant, a journalist, challenged whether the ads were misleading because they implied that using titanium dioxide-containing toothpastes was potentially harmful.","ZING Oral Care Ltd said they had removed ad (b) from Facebook. They referred to a clinical risk assessment, a systematic literature review, a clinical survey, an online news article, and a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Opinion. They said those sources established that titanium dioxide (TiO2) was likely to cause an adverse reaction in humans following oral consumption.","Upheld The ASA understood that TiO2 was frequently used to enhance the white pigmentation of various products, such as in food or paint, and that in 2022 its use as a food additive had been prohibited in the European Union (EU) and Northern Ireland. That was following an EFSA Opinion which indicated genotoxicity – chemical substance damage to human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) – following the consumption of nanosized TiO2 particles through the food additive E171 could not be ruled out. As a result, they could not establish a safe level for daily intake. TiO2 was permitted as a food additive in England, Scotland, and Wales, and the Food Standards Authority (FSA) was conducting its own review of the substance in that regard. In both the UK and the EU TiO2 was permitted for use in cosmetics such as toothpaste, with certain stipulations, and in medicines. We considered consumers would understand the ads’ claims about TiO2 – which included “You shouldn’t have to brush with suspected carcinogens”, “Titanium Dioxide is a suspected carcinogen, and banned in food by the European Food Safety Authority. However, it remains an ingredient in many common 'white' toothpastes” and “f*ck cancer” – to mean TiO2 was widely used in toothpastes, and that it was potentially carcinogenic. We further considered consumers would interpret the claims to mean that by using TiO2-containing toothpastes they were likely to be exposed to a carcinogen that was not present in ZING Oral Care’s products. We assessed the clinical risk assessment, literature review, clinical survey and online news article provided by ZING Oral Care. While some of the evidence related to the use of TiO2-containing toothpaste, the risk assessment, survey and online news article did not focus on the claimed carcinogenic nature of the substance when used in toothpaste. Additionally, the EFSA Opinion related to the use of TiO2 as an additive in food. We therefore considered that evidence was not adequate substantiation for the claims under investigation. We then assessed the literature review. The review examined whether a potential adverse outcome of oral TiO2 exposure was the formation of intestinal tumours. The review covered 18 studies that observed the levels of TiO2 in rats and mice following oral exposure, and then compared them against two studies that outlined the build-up of TiO2 within the organs and tissue of 30 cadavers who had an average age of 86. We acknowledged that three of the studies examined whether TiO2 consumption in rats or mice led to the formation of intestinal tumours. However, we understood that those studies did not observe the actual formation of cancerous intestinal tumours in rats or mice. The review as a whole had drawn its conclusions from studies that had been conducted on animals and then compared with post-mortem human tissues. Additionally, the review made no findings on human exposure to TiO2 in toothpaste, or its claimed carcinogenic nature. We therefore considered the review was not adequate substantiation for the claims. We welcomed ZING Oral Care’s assurance that ad (b) had been removed. However, because we considered the body of evidence provided was not adequate substantiation for the claims that using toothpaste containing titanium dioxide was potentially harmful, we concluded they had not been substantiated and were therefore likely to mislead. The ads breached CAP (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 3.33 (Comparisons with identifiable competitors).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told ZING Oral Care Ltd not to claim that using toothpaste containing titanium dioxide was harmful to humans without adequate substantiation.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/zing-oral-care-ltd-a23-1199892-zing-oral-care-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Emma Matratzen GmbH t/a Emma Mattress,,"Two paid-for YouTube ads for a mattress comparison site top5bestmattresses.co.uk, seen in May 2023: a. The first ad was a video that contained a person in a T-shirt with the text “Top 5” written on it. They said, “Hello, and welcome to the top five best mattresses dot com. Today, we’ll be testing the UK’s most awarded mattress: the Emma original.” An Emma mattress was then unboxed and displayed on a bed. The person explained the different elements of the mattress, including the different materials and layers of the mattress. They gave a positive assessment of the Emma mattress. They concluded the video by stating, “In summary, it has top quality materials, it adapts to all body types, it contains a removable and washable cover, it has a two-hundred-night trial, and it can be placed on any type of bed. Our verdict: we love Emma and everything about it. Try it and tell us how your first nights were with it. See you in the next review.” b. The second ad was a static image that contained graphics of a person lying on a mattress, the different layers of a mattress, a mattress with an award ribbon above, and a mattress coming out of a box. Below this was the text “Exclusive Deals and Coupon Codes – Spring Sales: Up to 55% … compare popular beds brands in 2023. Check out exclusive deals and discount codes … www.top5bestmattress.co.uk/”. Links labelled “How to choose a mattress”, “Sleep products” and “Best” were also included.","Four complainants, who understood that top5bestmattresses.co.uk was owned by a mattress company, challenged whether the ads made clear their commercial intent.","Emma Matratzen GmbH (Emma) believed it was clear that the Top 5 website was owned by a mattress company and pointed out that the complainants had understood this. They said the ads contained a link to the Top 5 website and on the landing page was explanatory text which outlined that the Top 5 website was owned and controlled by a subsidiary of Emma. However, Emma acknowledged that the explanatory text was not included in the ads. They said that they would be changing their ads to ensure the explanatory text was available for consumers. Ad (a) had been changed to include the overlaying text “Top5 best mattress is a comparison site operated by DIBMat GmbH, a fully owned subsidiary of Emma Sleep GmbH that owns the Emma mattress featured on this video”. They said they would ensure that future marketing communications made clear that they were associated with the Top 5 website.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must make clear their commercial intent, if that is not obvious from the context. We acknowledged Emma’s explanation that top5bestmattresses.co.uk was owned and controlled by a subsidiary of Emma. We considered that consumers would understand from ad (a), which included “Top 5”, “we’ll be testing the UK’s most awarded mattress”, and “See you in the next review”, as implying that top5bestmattresses.co.uk was an independent review site. It implied that an impartial source had judged the mattress and arrived at the conclusion that it was a very good overall product. Ad (b) featured a stylised image of a mattress with an award ribbon above, and the text “compare popular brands in 2023 …”, and the website address, “www.top5bestmattress.co.uk”. It included links to advisory notes, for example, “How to choose a mattress” as well as a link to “best” products. In the absence of any clear qualification to explain the context of the claims, the ad was likely to be interpreted as representing an unbiased, independent review site where mattress brands were objectively compared and the best recommended. However, given that top5bestmattresses.co.uk was owned and controlled by a subsidiary of Emma, any comparison or recommendation was not independent. We acknowledged Emma’s comment that that the ads contained a link to the Top 5 website where a disclaimer outlined that it was owned and controlled by a subsidiary of Emma. However, this information was material to consumers’ understanding of the ads and the partiality of the website they were directed to, which was likely to influence their decision to proceed further with an enquiry. As such, that information should have appeared in the ads themselves. Given that both ads implied independent comparisons of popular mattresses could be found at top5bestmattress.co.uk when this was not the case, we concluded that the ads omitted material information, did not make clear their commercial intent, and were therefore likely to mislead. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.3 (Recognition of marketing materials), and 3.1, 3.3 and 3.9 (Misleading advertising).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Geekvape Electronic Cigarettes (UK) Ltd,,"A TikTok post from Lucci Love’s account, @ lucci.love98, posted on 19 April 2023. The video showed Lucci Love opening a box of Geek Bar vapes and saying, “…I just want to come on here and tell you what has come in the post today […] they are Geek Bars, the new and improved ones, so I’m going to be doing some content over the next few days and weeks and whatnot, I’m going to test them all and let you know how they get on. They are actually 600 puffs and it's, like, a consistent thing where the flavour stays throughout the whole 600 puffs. So not only is it aesthetically pleasing […] they've actually made the battery last a lot longer as well. Shout out to Perry at Fresh Vapes.” On-screen text seen throughout the video stated “GeekBar Vapes”. Text at the bottom of the video stated “#e600mesh #geekbar #freshgeek #ad”.","The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code by promoting unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components on TikTok.","Geekvape Electronic Cigarettes (UK) Ltd did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. TikTok said the promotion of vapes was prohibited under their branded content policy, and the ad had been removed. They said they would review Lucci Love’s other posts.","Upheld The ASA was concerned by Geekvape’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries, and told them to do so in future. CAP Code rule 22.12 reflected a legislative ban contained in the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations (TRPR) on the advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes in certain media. The rule stated that, except for media targeted exclusively to the trade, marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components that were not licensed as medicines were not permitted in newspapers, magazines and periodicals, or in online media and some other forms of electronic media. It further stated that factual claims about products were permitted on marketers’ own websites and, in certain circumstances, in other non-paid-for space online under the marketer’s control. The CAP guidance “Electronic cigarette advertising prohibitions” (the Guidance) explained that the prohibition on ads in “online media and some other forms of electronic media” reflected the legal prohibition on ads in “information society services”. The Guidance indicated that ads placed in paid-for social media placements, advertisement features or contextually targeted branded content were likely to be prohibited. We considered whether TikTok was an online media space where such advertising, using factual claims only, was permitted. We understood that, while promotional content was prohibited on retailers’ own websites, rule 22.12 specified a particular exception that the provision of factual information was not prohibited. The basis of the exception to the rule was because consumers had to specifically seek out that factual information by visiting the website. The Guidance stated that, in principle, there was likely to be scope for the position relating to factual claims being acceptable on marketers’ websites, to apply to some social media activity. A social media page or account might be considered to be analogous to a website and able to make factual claims if it could only be found by those actively seeking it. We understood that public posts could be seen by anyone who visited the TikTok website on a web browser and by any users of the app. It was possible for public posts from a TikTok account to be distributed beyond those users who had signed up to follow the account due to TikTok’s algorithms and account settings. We considered that was consistent with content being pushed to consumers without having opted-in to receive the message it contained, and therefore it was not equivalent to actively seeking out information about e-cigarettes. Given that characteristic, we considered that material from a public TikTok account was not analogous to a retailer’s own website, and that material posted from such an account was therefore subject to the prohibition on advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes, meaning that neither promotional nor factual content was permitted. We considered that advertising content from @lucci.love98’s TikTok account was similarly not analogous to a retailer’s own website and that material posted from that account was therefore subject to the prohibition on advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes, meaning that the restriction that applied to online media under rule 22.12 was applicable, and neither promotional nor factual content was permitted. In the post, Lucci Love stated, ""I just want to come on here and tell you what has come in the post today"" and ""Shout out to Perry at Fresh Vapes"" and we therefore understood that she had been sent and gifted the e-cigarettes, which constituted a payment to the influencer. The post was also tagged as “#ad”, was labelled as being a “paid partnership” with the brand, and on-screen text stated “#GeekBar Vapes” throughout the course of the post. We also considered that statements, such as “new and improved”, “the flavour stays throughout the whole 600 puffs”, and the hashtags ““#e600mesh”, “freshgeek” and “#geekbar” had the appearance of brand and marketing slogans and hashtags. We therefore considered that the post was a marketing communication falling within the remit of the CAP Code. We considered whether the ad directly or indirectly promoted a nicotine-containing e-cigarette. Unlicensed e-cigarettes were prominently featured in the ad, which also made reference to the product’s technological features, aesthetic design and the available flavours. We therefore considered that the ads contained promotional content for the product and consequently the restriction that applied to online media under rule 22 .12 was applicable. Because the ad had the direct or indirect effect of promoting e-cigarettes which were not licensed as medicines in non-permitted media, we concluded that it breached the Code.",The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Geekvape Electronic Cigarettes (UK) Ltd that marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components which were not licensed as medicines should not be made from a public TikTok account. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/geekvape-electronic-cigarettes--uk--ltd-a23-1205195-geekvape-electronic-cigarettes--uk--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Indiralaxmi Vignesh Ltd t/a Hale Clinic,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on long COVID treatments, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 30 August 2023.","A website and a paid-for search listing for The Hale Clinic, a complementary medicine practise: a. The website www.haleclinic.com, seen on 26 June 2023, included text on the hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) webpage that stated “HBOT AND POST-COVID SYNDROME […] around 17% of patients continue to have problematic symptoms up to 3 months after the onset of COVID-19 — even after tests no longer detect virus in their body. This is known as long COVID. The most common symptoms that people with long COVID-19 experience include: Loss of taste and/or smell Sleep issues Tachycardia Gut issues Anxiety Difficulty breathing Joint pain Chest pain Brain fog, including an inability to concentrate and impaired memory Fatigue”. Further text stated “HBOT supplements the amount of oxygen dissolved by body’s tissues following infection and is quickly proving to be a useful method complementary to long COVID treatment, with studies and clinical trials already in place […] Over the past year there have been several people sharing the healing HBO treatment has brought to them after experiencing lingering symptoms of the Covid-19 virus”. b. The paid-for Google search result, seen during May 2023, featured headline text which stated “Long-Covid Treatment – Accelerates Healing & Recovery”. Further text below stated “HBOT Helps In Alleviating Symptoms Such As Fatigue, Insomnia and More. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) - £79 for 60 Minutes. Book an Appointment”.",The ASA challenged whether the claims in ads (a) and (b) that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) could treat long COVID were misleading and could be substantiated.,"Indiralaxmi Vignesh Ltd t/a The Hale Clinic said they appreciated the importance of ensuring that any advertising claims about medical treatments, including HBOT for long COVID, were fully substantiated and not misleading. They took their responsibilities to provide accurate, evidence-based information to the public seriously. They provided evidence to support their claims about the potential effectiveness of HBOT for long COVID. The Hale Clinic said that while they believed the studies substantiated their claims, they understood that medical research was a continuously evolving field and they remained committed to updating their understanding and communications based on the latest evidence. They also said they never presented HBOT as a guaranteed cure for long COVID. Instead, they presented it as a potential treatment option that may provide relief for some patients, based on scientific studies and under the guidance and supervision of medical professionals.","Upheld Ad (a) stated “The most common symptoms that people with long COVID-19 experience include: Loss of taste and/or smell Sleep issues Tachycardia Gut issues Anxiety Difficulty breathing Joint pain Chest pain Brain fog, including an inability to concentrate and impaired memory Fatigue"" and ""HBOT […] is quickly proving to be a useful method complementary to long COVID treatment […] Over the past year there have been several people sharing the healing HBO treatment has brought to them after experiencing lingering symptoms of the Covid-19 virus”. Ad (b) stated “Long-Covid Treatment – Accelerates Healing & Recovery […] HBOT Helps In Alleviating Symptoms Such As Fatigue, Insomnia and More”. The ASA considered consumers would understand the ads to mean that HBOT could treat long COVID and the symptoms of it. We therefore expected to see robust scientific evidence to substantiate the claims. We assessed the evidence provided which included a published study, two medical press releases and two news articles. We did not consider that the news articles, one of which discussed the results of a study that used HBOT in subjects with long COVID and the other discussed the personal experience of someone who used HBOT for their long COVID symptoms, met the standard of evidence we required for the type of claims being made. Both press releases discussed the outcomes of the same small, double-blind, randomised controlled trial that measured the effect of HBOT on heart function in patients with long COVID. However, because they were only press releases, and we had not seen the study to which they related, we did not consider that they met the standard of evidence we required for the type of claims being made. The study, which involved giving ten HBOT sessions over a 12-day period to ten patients with long COVID-related fatigue symptoms, measured the change in fatigue and cognitive profile. The results showed a statistically significant improvement to both fatigue and some cognitive outcome measures. However, because the number of participants in the study was small, there was no control group, and it was not blinded, we considered that it did not meet the standard of evidence we expected to see. Furthermore, there was no follow-up to assess whether any of the measured improvements following HBOT were sustained. Therefore, because we had not seen adequate evidence to substantiate the efficacy claims that HBOT could treat long COVID or certain symptoms of it, we concluded that the ads were misleading. Ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ads must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on NUMA Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on long COVID treatments, identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by the ASA. See also related rulings published on 30 August 2023.","A website and Facebook post for NUMA, a Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy clinic: a. The website www.numaoxygen.com, seen on 26 June 2023, included a page labelled “Conditions”. Text under the “Complementary Therapy” heading stated “A growing number of people who have chronic and debilitating conditions use Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy alongside their standard medical treatment. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an emerging therapy, and so research into its efficacy is ongoing. HBOT is being studied for the conditions listed below […] Emerging Indications: Long Covid […]”. b. The post on the NUMA Facebook page, dated 8 February 2023, stated “Make sure you’re in the know! Check out our blog post for a detailed breakdown of how HBOT can help with Long Covid Symptoms.

In relation to ad (a), they had provided consumers with a disclaimer which stated “However, at this time, neither the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) nor NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) had cleared or authorised the use of any HBOT to treat COVID-19 or any emerging conditions beyond those listed above”. They provided evidence which included studies which they said related to the potential benefits of HBOT use in long COVID. NUMA said they had referrals for patients with long COVID from cardiologists, respiratory consultants, and neurologist colleagues because of that evidence. They ensured that all their patients were thoroughly informed about the potential benefits, side effects and limitations of HBOT and the lack of randomised controlled trials in the field. They provided a screenshot from an anonymised patient file which they said demonstrated their processes.","Upheld Ad (a) stated “A growing number of people who have chronic and debilitating conditions use Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy alongside their standard medical treatment […] HBOT is being studied for the conditions listed below […] Emerging Indications: Long Covid […]”. Ad (b) stated “Check out our blog post for a detailed breakdown of how HBOT can help with Long Covid Symptoms”. The ASA considered that consumers would understand the claims in the ads to mean that HBOT could treat long COVID and its symptoms. We acknowledged ad (a) stated that research into HBOT's efficacy was ongoing. However, particularly as HBOT was listed on the “Conditions” page under the ""Complementary Therapy"" heading on the website, we considered that statement did not alter the overall impression that HBOT could treat long COVID and its symptoms. We therefore expected to see robust scientific evidence to substantiate the claims. We understood from the NICE website that long COVID was a multi-system condition with a range of debilitating symptoms. Its signs and symptoms continued or developed after acute COVID-19, continued for more than 4 weeks, and were not explained by any alternative diagnosis. Long COVID may consist of a number of distinct syndromes, which could include post-ICU (intensive care unit) syndrome, post-viral fatigue syndrome, long-term COVID syndrome, and permanent organ damage. We also understood that HBOT involved breathing 100% (pure) oxygen in a special pressurised chamber. We assessed the evidence provided which included three published studies and two case studies. We had only been provided with the abstracts of the two case studies. They were on the use of HBOT to treat a single individual and six patients, respectively, who had long COVID. Although we had not seen the case studies in full, we considered that in any case, results could not be drawn from such small patient sizes and that the case studies did not meet the standard of evidence required for the type of claims being made. The first published study, which involved giving ten HBOT sessions over a 12-day period to ten patients with long COVID-related fatigue symptoms, measured the change in fatigue and cognitive profile. The results showed a statistically significant improvement to both fatigue and some cognitive outcome measures. However, because the number of participants in the study was small, there was no control group, and it was not blinded, we considered that it did not meet the standard of evidence we expected to see. Furthermore, there was no follow-up to assess whether any of the measured improvements from receiving HBOT were sustained. We considered that the study was insufficient to substantiate the claims in ads (a) and (b). The second study was a randomised, controlled, double-blind trial which evaluated the effect of HBOT in 73 post COVID-19 patients with ongoing symptoms, and in particular their neurocognitive function. Patients received either 40 daily HBOT or sham sessions within a two-month period. Follow-up assessments were performed at baseline and 1–3 weeks after the last treatment session. In those who were treated with HBOT, compared to the control group, there were significant improvements in the primary outcome which was the global cognitive score and the attention and executive function domains, but not in the memory, information processing speed and motor skills domains. Whilst there were also some significant improvements in the HBOT group, compared to the control group, for a number of the secondary outcomes that were assessed using self-reported questionnaires that related to quality of life, sleep, psychological distress, and pain, many of the specific domains were not significantly improved. We considered that although there were significant improvements in some specific areas of both the primary and secondary outcome measures, there were also areas, which in some instances were closely related to the improved areas, where improvement was not seen. There were also limitations with the study. We considered that the number of participants in the study was small and the results were obtained 1-3 weeks after the last HBOT session, after which there was no follow-up to assess whether any of the measured improvements from receiving HBOT were sustained. Additionally, the study stated that the optimal number of HBOT sessions to achieve maximal therapeutic effect was yet to be determined. For the reasons stated, we therefore considered that the study was insufficient to substantiate the claims in the ads. The third study, which we understood was part of the same study population as the one referenced above, followed the same randomised, sham-controlled, double blinded protocol and evaluated the effect of HBOT on cardiac function. In this trial, 60 participants underwent an ECG (echocardiography) exam at baseline and 1-3 weeks after the last session. The results showed a significant improvement in global longitudinal strain (GLS) (a measure of myocardial deformation) in the HBOT group, particularly in those who had reduced GLS at baseline. We understood that of the 60 patients, 29 had reduced GLS at baseline, with 16 and 13 being allocated to the HBOT and sham groups, respectively. Following HBOT treatment, 10 patients (62.5%) from the HBOT group had normalised GLS levels and 5 (38.4%) in the sham group. It was therefore only a proportion of those patients who received HBOT, having had a reduced GLS at baseline, who showed an improvement in GLS – which was only one measure of HBOT’s effectiveness. We understood that the primary outcome measure of the study was to assess neurocognitive function in long COVID patients and that the effect of HBOT on cardiac function was one of a number of secondary outcome measures. The study was therefore designed primarily to study neuro-cognitive function and we considered that there may be other measures needed to adequately assess cardiac function. We also considered that the claim “people who have chronic and debilitating conditions use Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy” in ad (a), suggested that people who had HBOT would experience an overall and general improvement in how they actually felt on a day-to-day basis, rather than improving one specific measure, GLS, which did not affect all participants in the study and may not have demonstrably improved their long COVID symptoms. As mentioned above in relation to the second study, we considered that the number of participants in the study was small, there was no follow-up to assess whether any of the measured improvements after receiving HBOT were sustained following results obtained 1-3 weeks after the last HBOT session, nor had the optimal number of HBOT sessions been determined. For the reasons stated, we therefore considered that the study was insufficient to substantiate the claims in the ads. Therefore, because we had not seen adequate evidence to substantiate the efficacy claims that HBOT could treat long COVID or certain symptoms of it, we concluded that the ads were misleading.

ASA Ruling on TJC & BLC Aesthetics Clinic & Training Academy,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A post on the Facebook page for Tjc Blc Aesthetics, dated 29 May 2023, promoted a training course called “PATHWAY TO AESTHETICS”. Text stated “Fully Accredited […] it doesn’t cost us much to train you & teach you the skills we have, which could potentially change your life just like it did with us, The [sic] average cost for this course is £1000+ […] NOT WITH US - You will get the exact same but with a fraction of the price £299 for the next 3 people to book onto our start from scratch course”. Underneath the opening text, the ad contained a list of nine subjects the course covered, which included “Foundation Dermal Filler […] Foundation Botox […] Vitamin b12 [sic] injections […] Anatomy & Physiology Level 3/4 […] First Aid / CPR / Anaphylaxis”. Further text stated “Fully Accredited Certificates […] Please please ring my accredited provider & get confirmation that u will be FULLY QUALIFIED […] We are fully accredited with ARAP! […] My AET LEVEL 3 teaching qualification is also with the same provider !!!!”.","The Joint Council for Cosmetic Practitioners, who believed the training course did not conform to their own standards, challenged whether the: 1. ad was misleading because it offered a training course for aesthetics procedures without making clear the nature, requirements, qualifications and possible professional registration details of the course; and 2. claims that the course was “Fully Accredited” and that potential students would be “FULLY QUALIFIED” were misleading and could be substantiated.","1. In their response to the ASA, TJC & BLC Aesthetics Clinic & Training Academy did not directly comment on Issue 1. 2. TJC & BLC Aesthetics said that they purchased training manuals for the courses they provided from an online aesthetics supplies wholesale supplier, and that they were approved training manuals with the relevant accreditation. They said that prospective students would receive comprehensive training in all relevant areas.","1. Upheld The ASA noted that the ad contained the words “Fully Accredited Course” and “Fully Accredited Certificates”. Further claims stated that the course could “teach you the skills we have, which could potentially change your life”, and included a list of nine subjects which it covered. We considered that prospective students seeking a qualification which would enable them to perform aesthetics treatments would understand from the ad that completing the ““PATHWAY TO AESTHETICS” training course would give them the knowledge and skills needed to begin administering such treatments professionally. As such, we considered that the ads should have provided them with the information they needed to make an informed decision as to whether or not to enquire further about enrolling on the course. We noted that on their web page “Choosing who will do your cosmetic procedure”, the NHS advised patients that they could check if professionals offering cosmetic procedures were listed on a voluntary register accredited by the Professional Standards Authority, including the Joint Council of Cosmetic Practitioners, which informed patients that practitioners met set standards of training, insurance and skill.The NHS page advised patients considering undergoing cosmetic treatments - which both required a prescription and those that did not - to ensure that the person giving them the injections was trained and safe to do so, and to make sure they knew what training and experience they had. Further advice recommended that patients avoided practitioners who had only completed a short training course, due to potential complications and risk. We considered that prospective students might have been unfamiliar with the advice given by the NHS, but that such information was likely to impact on prospective patients’ choice of practitioner. In that context, we considered that ads for training courses that were intended to provide students with qualifications relevant to the administration of aesthetics treatments should have provided information on: the minimum requirements for acceptance onto the course; the qualification that would be attained; the nature and duration of the training; and whether the qualification met the standards necessary for admittance onto a relevant professional register. We considered that information to be material because it gave students an indication of the likelihood of the course giving them the knowledge and skills required to safely carry out the procedures independently. We noted that the ad did not state what the minimum requirements for acceptance onto the course were, what qualification would be attained upon completion of the course, the nature and duration of the training, and whether the qualification met the standards necessary for admittance onto a relevant professional register. We acknowledged that the ad stated “Fully Accredited Course”, ““Fully Accredited Certificates”, and “We are fully accredited with ARAP”. We understood ARAP to refer to the Alliance of Registered Aesthetic Practitioners, an independent organisation who reviewed training providers and supported the attainment of Continuous Professional Development (CPD) accreditation. It was not clear from the ad, however, what that accreditation entailed, how ARAP accreditation worked, or how it related specifically to the training of people to carry out aesthetics treatments. Because the ad omitted the material information listed above, we concluded that it was likely to mislead. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation). 2. Upheld The CAP Code required that marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so, and must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information. The course seen in the ad was titled “PATHWAY TO AESTHETICS”. Text seen in the ad stated “Fully Accredited Certificates” and “u [sic] will be FULLY QUALIFIED”. Further claims included “We are fully accredited with ARAP”. We considered that prospective students seeking a career in aesthetics treatments would understand from the ad that completing the “PATHWAY TO AESTHETICS” course would mean that they were fully qualified to start professionally carrying out such treatments.In their response, TJC & BLC Aesthetics said that students were made aware during the course of the requirements governing the prescription and injections aspect of aesthetics treatments, and were told that the majority of insurance companies required new starters in the industry to have a minimum of six months experience in medical needling. They said that the “PATHWAYS TO AESTHETICS” course had been designed for people who were starting their journey towards becoming qualified to provide aesthetics treatments. We again noted the claim that TJC & BLC Aesthetics were “fully accredited with ARAP”, who reviewed CPD training providers. We understood that to be accredited with ARAP, they would take actions such as reviewing course materials, checking that materials were written to the correct educational level and were accurate, and that relevant insurance cover was in place. While we acknowledged that CPD training was a widely recognised form of ongoing professional development and training, we understood that there was a distinct difference between a CPD certificate and a recognised qualification. We understood that CPD training sat outside of the qualifications framework and could not offer recognised qualifications, such as a National Vocational Qualification. Prospective students would have understood from the ad that they would be “FULLY QUALIFIED” after completing the course, but in fact the course was designed as an introduction to the topic, and further training and experience would be expected to be completed in order to work independently. Also, because the ad made reference to achieving a qualification, when in fact students would receive a CPD certificate, and not a recognised qualification, we concluded that the ad was likely to mislead. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told TJC & BLC Aesthetics Clinic & Training Academy to ensure their future advertising did not omit material information, such as the requirements for acceptance onto the course, the nature and duration of the training, the qualification that would be attained and whether the qualification met the standards necessary for admittance onto a relevant professional register. We also told them to ensure that they did not imply that courses they offered provided consumers with recognised qualifications, if that was not the case.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/tjc---blc-aesthetics-clinic---training-academy-a23-1198894-tjc--blc-aesthetics-clinic-training-academy.html
ASA Ruling on Vaporesso,,"Two TikTok posts, promoting Vaporesso brand e-cigarettes: a. A TikTok post from the account of Ethan Overton (@ethanovertonn), posted on 26 May 2023. The video showed a box containing a Vaporesso LUXE XR e-cigarette being opened. The audio stated, “So today a little random present came through the door. This is the Vaporesso XR, and this isn’t just your standard reusable vape. In the package it comes with an extra pod, charging cable and of course the vape itself. It’s up to you what flavour you want to pick, and whether you want it to be a tobacco liquid or not [...] Very nifty bit of kit. […] The Vappresso Luxe XR. Link in bio.” Text at the bottom of the video stated “#ad #vaporesso #luxex #vaporessoluxe”. TikTok’s “Paid Partnership” label was seen beneath the hashtags. b. A TikTok post from the account of Lucky Ben (@luckyyben), posted on 10 April 2023. The video showed Lucky Ben and a friend discussing the Vaporesso LUXE XR e-cigarette, including saying, “It’s got the leak resistant technology audio and it’s got the coil compatibility” and “Flavour boosting […] This is new on the market right now […] Check the link in the bio, people.” The speech also appeared as on screen text. Text at the bottom of the video stated “@Vaporesso #vaporesso #luxexr #vaporessoluxexr”.","The ASA challenged whether the ads breached the Code by promoting unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components on TikTok.","Vaporesso said the posts had been removed. Ethan Overton said the post had been removed. TikTok said ad (a) was not a paid-ad, but Branded Content. The promotion of vapes was prohibited under their branded content policy and the ad had been removed. They said ad (b) was User Generated Content and the user had not engaged the Branded Content toggle. The user had deleted the post.","Upheld CAP Code rule 22.12 reflected a legislative ban contained in the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations (TRPR) on the advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes in certain media. The rule stated that, except for media targeted exclusively to the trade, marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components that were not licensed as medicines were not permitted in newspapers, magazines and periodicals, or in online media and some other forms of electronic media. It further stated that factual claims about products were permitted on marketers’ own websites and, in certain circumstances, in other non-paid-for space online under the marketer’s control. The CAP guidance on “Electronic cigarette advertising prohibitions” (the Guidance) explained that the prohibition on ads in “online media and some other forms of electronic media” reflected the legal prohibition on ads in “information society services”. The Guidance indicated that ads placed in paid-for social media placements, advertisement features and contextually targeted branded content were likely to be prohibited. We considered whether TikTok was an online media space where such advertising, using factual claims only, was permitted. We understood that, while promotional content was prohibited on retailers’ own websites, rule 22.12 specified a particular exception that the provision of factual information was not prohibited. The basis of the exception to the rule was because consumers had to specifically seek out that factual information by visiting the website. The Guidance stated that, in principle, there was likely to be scope for the position relating to factual claims being acceptable on marketers’ websites, to apply to some social media activity. A social media page or account might be considered to be analogous to a website and able to make factual claims if it could only be found by those actively seeking it. We understood that public posts could be seen by anyone who visited the TikTok website on a web browser and by any users of the app. It was possible for public posts from a TikTok account to be distributed beyond those users who had signed up to follow the account due to TikTok’s algorithms and account settings. We considered that was consistent with content being pushed to consumers without having opted-in to receive the message it contained, and therefore it was not equivalent to actively seeking out information about e-cigarettes. Given that characteristic, we considered that material from a public TikTok account was not analogous to a retailer’s own website, and that material posted from such an account was therefore subject to the prohibition on advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes, meaning that neither promotional nor factual content was permitted. We considered that advertising content from the @ethanovertonn and @luckyyben TikTok accounts was similarly not analogous to a retailer’s own website and that material posted from those accounts was therefore subject to the prohibition on advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes, meaning that the restriction that applied to online media under rule 22.12 was applicable, and neither promotional nor factual content was permitted. We understood from Ethan Overton’s video in ad (a) that the brand had sent the e-cigarettes to the influencer, which constituted a payment to the influencer. We noted the post was tagged “#ad”, “#vaporesso” and “#vaporessoluxe”, and was labelled as a paid partnership. We considered that statements such as “this isn’t just your standard reusable vape”, “it comes with an extra pod, charging cable and of course the vape itself”, “It’s up to you what flavour you want to pick, and whether you want it to be a tobacco liquid or not”, “leak resistant technology”, “coil compatibility” and “Flavour boosting”, which described the features of the products, and that text such as “#vaporessoluxe” and “#vaporessoluxexr” had the appearance of brand and marketing slogans and hashtags. Moreover, we considered that the similarity of the hashtags “#luxex” and “#vaporessoluxe” in ad (a), and “#luxexr” and “#vaporessoluxexr” in ad (b) indicated that the posts were part of a wider and coordinated marketing approach. We therefore considered that ads (a) and (b) were marketing communications falling within the remit of the CAP Code. We considered whether the ads directly or indirectly promoted a nicotine-containing e-cigarette. Unlicensed e-cigarettes were prominently featured in the ads, which also made reference to the technological features and available flavours of the product. We also considered that statements such as “Link in bio”, in ad (a), and “Check the link in the bio, people” in ad (b) expressly directed viewers to the brands website. We therefore considered that the ads contained promotional content for the product and consequently the restriction that applied to online media under rule 22.12 was applicable.

ASA Ruling on Chengyi Daily Department Store t/a Shop1102829235 Store,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for ad from a store on the AliExpress website, www.aliexpress.com, seen on 27 July 2023, displayed alongside product listings which were returned following a search for “belly button slimming patches”. The ad included the headline text “Lose weight” with smaller text underneath that stated “Accidentally thin”. A photo on the left showed the torso of an overweight woman with text underneath that stated “before”. A photo on the right-hand side showed a woman, shown full length from behind wearing only pants, whose spine, shoulder blades and ribs were very prominent, and with very thin arms and legs. The price and the text “Belly Slimming Patch Lose Weight …” were shown underneath.","The ASA challenged whether the ad: 1. was irresponsible, because the featured model appeared unhealthily thin; and 2. made medicinal claims for an unlicensed product.","1. & 2. Chengyi Daily Department Store t/a Shop1102829235 Store did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. Alibaba Group, who owned the AliExpress website, said they had removed the ad. They had also flagged the image to prevent it, or similar images, being used in ads by other businesses on their platform. They would pay additional attention to ads relating to weight loss products in future, and were looking further into the requirements of the Code in relation to the use of medicinal claims for unlicensed products. They further confirmed that they were planning to announce a ban on product listings involving improper or misleading advertising for medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products on AliExpress and were in the process of reviewing their internal procedures accordingly.","Upheld The ASA was concerned by Chengyi Daily Department Store’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. 1. Upheld The ad included a photo of a woman who was so thin she appeared skeletal and malnourished. The image was presented as the “after” result of using the advertised product to lose weight and be “Accidentally thin”. It was displayed to users of AliExpress who had searched for products to help with slimming. The ASA considered the ad had the effect of normalising the aspiration to be dangerously thin, and encouraging those who saw it to have that aspiration. We further considered it encouraged people to purchase unlicensed and potentially unsafe products (see below) to achieve extreme weight loss. We concluded the ad was socially irresponsible. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition12) rule 1.3 (Responsible advertising). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that medicines must have a licence from the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency), VMD (Veterinary Medicines Directorate) or under the auspices of the EMA (European Medicines Agency) before they were marketed. We noted that unlicensed medicines had not been assessed for efficacy, quality or safety. The MHRA confirmed that, because the ad made medicinal claims for the product, it fell within the definition of a medicinal product. The product was not licensed by the MHRA and therefore was an unlicensed medicine. The ad claimed that the “Belly Slimming Patch” would cause weight loss, which was a medicinal claim; the product therefore was a medicinal product which must be licensed. Because the ad promoted an unlicensed medicine, we concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Chengyi Daily Department Store t/a Shop1102829235 Store to ensure the images used in their ads were prepared responsibly and did not portray dangerously or unhealthily thin people.

ASA Ruling on Daniels Vapes t/a danielsvapes1,,"A paid-for TikTok ad for Daniels Vapes, seen in July 2023, featured a video depicting someone asleep. A thought bubble above their head depicted their dream. The scene inside the bubble panned around a shop and showed shelves of brightly coloured e-cigarette products, while music played.",The ASA challenged whether: 1. the ad breached the Code by directly or indirectly promoting unlicensed nicotine-containing e-liquids and their components in online media; and 2. TikTok had breached the rules for Video Sharing Platforms regulated by statute by including an ad for electronic cigarettes.,"1. Daniels Vapes said when they had uploaded the video they had simply been following a trend on TikTok and had not realised that it represented a breach of the Code. They believed they or another account user had accidentally marked the video as a paid ad. 2. TikTok said they took their responsibilities as a Video Sharing Platform (VSP) very seriously and were committed to keeping users safe from inappropriate paid advertising. They said the promotion of e-cigarettes was prohibited under their Advertising Policies and confirmed that the ad had been removed from the platform. They had established that an element of their moderation systems did not identify the ad as a vape promotion and prohibit it accordingly. Vapes might appear to resemble pens, highlighters, lipstick tubes and even toys and so at times raised challenges for moderation models. Since the ad in question had a very small circulation, generating fewer than 1,000 views before it was removed, it did not trigger additional rounds of moderation. TikTok added that they were continuing to review and enhance their moderation systems as part of their internal quality assurance process. They were also committed to engaging with external bodies to identify regulatory challenges and develop partnerships to educate TikTok users about the risks of such products.","1. Upheld CAP Code rule 22.12 reflected a legislative ban contained in the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations (TRPR) on the advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes in certain media.

The Guidance indicated that ads placed in paid-for social media placements, advertisement features and contextually targeted branded content were likely to be prohibited. Under the CAP Code, marketers were responsible for ensuring that their ads were compliant. The ASA considered whether the ad directly or indirectly promoted a nicotine-containing e-cigarette. Unlicensed e-cigarettes featured prominently in the ad, which was for an e-cigarette store. We considered that the ad contained promotional content for the product and consequently the restriction that applied to online media under rule 22.12 was applicable. We acknowledged that Daniels Vapes had placed the ad in error. However, because the ad had the direct or indirect effect of promoting e-cigarettes that were not licensed as medicines in non-permitted media, we concluded that it breached the CAP Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 22.12 (Electronic cigarettes). 2. Upheld VSP Appendix rule 31.3 stated that advertisements for electronic cigarettes and electronic cigarette refill containers were prohibited. That rule applied to advertising that was “marketed, sold or arranged” by VSPs that were subject to statutory regulation in the UK under the Communications Act 2003 (as amended). As a VSP in UK jurisdiction, TikTok was responsible for ensuring that ads appearing in paid-for space on its platform complied with the Appendix rules. We acknowledged that TikTok’s moderation system had on this occasion not identified the ad as an e-cigarette promotion and that once notified they had taken swift action to remove it. However, because the ad was for a prohibited product, we concluded that it breached the VSP Appendix. On that point, the ad breached VSP Appendix rule 31.3.",The ad must not appear again in the form complained about.

ASA Ruling on Dr Rani Ltd t/a Daily Chemist,,"A paid-for search ad for DailyChemist, an online pharmacy, seen on 18 May 2023 which appeared under the search term “Ventolin”, and was titled ""Fast Dispatch, 24hr Delivery - Prices as low as £6.99/ihhaler"". Text beneath that stated, “UK Regulated […] Asthma Inhaler from our online treatment service […]”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it promoted prescription-only medicines (POMs) to the public.,"Dr Rani Ltd t/a Daily Chemist said in their view the ad did not promote POMs or contain terminology that directly referred to them. They said that if a consumer initiated a search for a POM, it meant they had a degree of prior knowledge that distinguished them from the general public, and that the ad was therefore targeted at a specialist audience. Their content, be it in the search ad or the website it linked to, did not facilitate the purchase of Ventolin, or any other POM, to the public without a consultation. They said their website made clear to consumers that having a POM prescribed remained at the prescriber’s discretion, and that they had not made any claims in their advertising that implied there was a discount on the sale price of a POM. They referred to various screenshots of their website that outlined that discounts or incentives did not apply to POMs. They said they were committed to working collaboratively with the ASA to address and rectify any potential issues with the ad.","Upheld The ASA acknowledged and welcomed Daily Chemist’s willingness to work with the ASA and to make amendments to the ad. The CAP Code stated that POMs or prescription-only medical treatments must not be advertised to the public. The ad appeared under the search term “Ventolin” and stated “Prices as low as £6.99/inhaler” and “Buy Asthma Inhaler from our online treatment service”. We understood that Ventolin was the brand name for salbutamol sulphate reliever inhalers. We also understood that asthma inhalers were POMs. We therefore considered that consumers using that search term were likely to be looking for an online doctor consultation and prescription service that offered those POMs. We further considered consumers would understand the claims in the ad as referring to POM inhalers for the treatment of asthma. We considered the ad’s reference to an “online treatment service” would be understood by consumers as a general description of the Daily Chemist’s service. Additionally, the ad did not refer to any other treatment options. We therefore considered the ad had a clear implication that a POM inhaler for the treatment of asthma would be the outcome of using Daily Chemist’s service. For those reasons we considered the ad promoted a POM to the public and had therefore breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Dr Rani Ltd t/a Daily Chemist not to advertise POMs to the public in the future.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/dr-rani-ltd-a23-1198508-dr-rani-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Essential Sounds Hearing,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website for ES Hearing, www.eshearing.co.uk, a hearing aid company, seen on 7 May 2023. The homepage contained the text “ESH’S FOURTH GENERATION INVISIBLE HEARING AIDS”. The product page for the fourth generation hearing aid contained a video of a person inserting a hearing aid into their ear until it was no longer visible, and text which stated, “Invisible. Discreet and difficult for the naked eye to spot”. It also contained several images, one of which was headed “product parameters”. The page further stated, “30-day money-back guaranteed … 30-Day Risk-Free Cover … Immerse yourself in them for a full 30 days, if you’re not satisfied you're covered with our 30 day performance promise for a brand new pair”. Next to the image of the product was the text “17 sold in 24 hours … 3 left in stock”. Under the heading named “Description” text stated, “Nearly invisible”.","The complainant challenged whether the ad was misleading, because: 1. the hearing aid was visible when placed in the ear; and 2. they were unable to obtain a refund within thirty days. 3. The ASA challenged whether the claim “17 sold in 24 hours … 3 left in stock” was misleading.","1. Essential Sounds Hearing t/a ES Hearing told us that the hearing aid was invisible because it could go directly into the ear canal, but whether it would become invisible depended upon the ear canal in question. They told us the measurements of the hearing aids were displayed in a picture on the website, and the same picture also showed that the exterior part of the hearing aid was visible when it was in the ear. They had since substituted the word “invisible” for “in-ear” to give a more accurate description for those consumers whereby the hearing aids did not become invisible when placed in the ear. The video of a person inserting a hearing aid into their ear until it was no longer visible was removed from the website. 2. ES Hearing told us that the 30-day guarantee was in place for those occasions where the product did not meet certain performance standards, and they provided an annex which detailed those standards. They said that in the case of the complainant, there were no performance related issues with the product, and only aesthetic issues were raised. However, the complainant had since been issued with a refund. They removed the phrase “30-day money-back guaranteed”. 3. ES Hearing explained that the claim “17 sold in 24 hours … 3 left in stock” was based on the number of fourth-generation hearing aids expected to be sold and dispatched per day.","1. Upheld The ad stated “ESH’S FOURTH GENERATION INVISIBLE HEARING AIDS” on the homepage; under the heading “Description” on the product page was the text “Nearly invisible”. The product page also contained a video of a person inserting a hearing aid into their ear until it was no longer visible and text which stated, “Invisible. Discreet and difficult for the naked eye to spot”. The ASA considered that the messages on the website about the visibility of the product were contradictory. As such the ad was ambiguous, but it was reasonable for consumers to assume, from the references and demonstration as a whole, that once the hearing aids had been inserted, they would be barely visible, or only visible under close inspection. However, the hearing aids received by the complainant were easily visible when placed in their ears. We acknowledged that visibility may depend on the individual ear as ES Hearing explained, but this was not made clear, and the ad’s messaging was ambiguous about the visibility of the device. We concluded that the ad was likely to mislead. We welcomed ES Hearing’s assurance that they had edited the ad to give a more accurate description of the product. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.4.1 (Misleading advertising, and 3.11 (Exaggeration). 2. Upheld The product page for the fourth generation hearing aid contained text which stated, “30-day money-back guaranteed … 30-Day Risk-Free Cover! … Immerse yourself in them for a full 30 days, if you’re not satisfied you're covered with our 30 day performance promise for a brand new pair”. We acknowledged ES Hearing’s comment that a 30-day money-back guarantee was applicable only if the product did not meet certain performance standards. These performance standards included the following technical metrics: mean of frequency, maximum sound deviation, equivalent input noise level, total harmonic distortion, frequency response range, rated current and the maximum OSPL 90. However, there was no link drawn between the text concerning the 30-day money-back guaranteed claim, and the performance standards for the product. In the absence of a clear indication of the applicable criteria, consumers were likely to understand the references to mean that they could return the hearing aids within 30 days if they were not satisfied with their performance, which could include visibility. Because the ad failed to clarify the terms of the “money-back guaranteed”, “risk-free cover” and “performance promise” claims, we concluded that the ad was likely to mislead. We welcomed ES Hearing’s willingness to edit the ad. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.53, 3.54, and 3.55 (Guarantees and after-sales service). 3. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not falsely state that a product, or the terms on which it is offered, would be available only for a very limited time to deprive consumers of the time or opportunity to make an informed choice. Text stated, “17 sold in 24 hours … 3 left in stock”. We considered that consumers would understand from this that that there had been a high demand for the hearing aids, such that 17 pairs had been sold in the last 24 hours, and 3 pairs were left in stock. Consumers would therefore need to act quickly to secure a pair. We acknowledged ES Hearing's explanation of the claim. However, this did not accurately reflect available stock and hurried consumers into a decision to purchase unnecessarily. We therefore concluded that the claim “17 sold in 24 hours … 3 left in stock” had not been substantiated as consumers were likely to understand it and was misleading. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation), and 3.31 (Availability).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Essential Sounds Hearing t/a ES Hearing to ensure that in future claims relating to the appearance of the fourth generation hearing aids did not exaggerate their visibility. Claims relating to a money-back guarantee must be adequately qualified, and any quoted “in stock” and “sold” figures should be accurate.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/essential-sounds-hearing-a23-1197770-esh-hearing.html
ASA Ruling on Petfre (Gibraltar) Ltd t/a Betfred,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work banning gambling ads which, under strengthened rules, are prohibited from being likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","Three tweets for Betfred, which promoted an upcoming Anthony Joshua fight, seen in March and April 2023: a. The first tweet featured a video of boxer Anthony Joshua being interviewed by commentator Dom McGuinness about his diet ahead of his fight against Jermaine Franklin. Text on the post stated, “How does @anthonyjoshua stay in shape? A diet consisting of bananas with rice & ketchup with sweetcorn. How does @ant_crolla stay in shape? Guinness. Hear from @EddieHearn and @JermaineFrankl6 too on the Lightweight Boxing Show. #JoshuaFranklin @MatchroomBoxing”. b. The second tweet featured a video of Anthony Joshua being interviewed by Dom McGuinness about how he prepared for fights.

Watch the Lightweight Boxing Show on YouTube NOW! #JoshuaFranklin @MatchroomBoxing”. c. The third tweet featured a video of Anthony Joshua being interviewed about his mentality when fighting. Text on the post stated, “‘I'm going in there with pure confidence because I know the work I've done’ There are NO doubts in @AnthonyJoshua's mind ahead of his fight with Jermaine Franklin! Full interview #JoshuaFranklin”.","The ASA challenged whether the ads included an individual who was likely to be of strong appeal to those under 18 years of age, and therefore breached the Code.","Petfre (Gibraltar) Ltd t/a Betfred said they had carried out a thorough risk assessment of Anthony Joshua against the CAP guidance on gambling and lotteries advertising and were satisfied that he was not of strong appeal to under-18s. They said their social media channels were age-gated to users who were aged 18 years and over. They explained that where a platform did not have robust age verification methods in place, Betfred’s targeted campaigns were only served to users identified as 25 years and over and who had relative interests. They also said the posts were not advertising a gambling product or offer and that they were editorial in nature. Betfred said Mr Joshua was a 33-year-old former world champion boxer known almost exclusively for his sporting achievements. They explained that he had not held a championship title of any type since 2021 and his activities were almost exclusively limited to boxing and activities focused on his boxing career. Although they acknowledged that he was undoubtedly a “star” in the sport of boxing, they said he was reaching the end of his career and there was no evidence that he was a “notable star” and that, as per CAP guidance, he therefore posed a ‘low risk’ of appealing to children. They said that this inevitably had a bearing on not only his popularity but also his awareness and recognition amongst under-18s. In terms of his general profile, they said he had not appeared on any form of reality TV, further reducing the potential for him to strongly appeal to children. They said his brand deals, which included Under Armour, Beats By Dre and JD Sports, had universal appeal and were all well-known ‘household’ brands which were universally popular, irrespective of Mr Joshua’s endorsement. They provided data which showed less than 1% of each of these brands were followed by under-18s on social media. Whilst they acknowledged that Mr Joshua did have an extensive social media presence and media profile, Betfred said that stemmed almost exclusively from his sporting career and not from any other activity which could be deemed to have strong appeal to under-18s. They said social media data showed that 0% of his followers on Twitter/X, Facebook and TikTok were registered as being between 13 and 17 years old; 5% of his Snapchat followers and 6.6% of his Instagram followers were registered as being between 13 and 17 years old. Overall, they said he had 29.3 million followers worldwide, which they acknowledged meant he had a substantial social media presence. They said 1.1 million users were registered as being under 18. As this was 3.85% of his total followers, they considered Mr Joshua had an overwhelming adult following on social media. Further to this, they said only UK specific data should be assessed. They stated he had 7.2m followers in total in the UK and, assuming age breakdowns in the UK mirrored worldwide figures (3.85%), Betfred believed approximately 280,000 of Mr Joshua’s UK followers were under 18. They acknowledged that the total number excluded Snapchat, for which they did not have UK specific data. They argued 280,000 (specifically 279,936) was not a significant number of followers in absolute terms. Betfred stated that, as per CAP guidance, boxing was an adult-orientated sport which was unlikely to be of strong appeal to under-18s. They said Mr Joshua’s fights were usually shown late at night and that they were mostly shown on a pay-per-view or subscription basis, which required payment from someone over the age of 18. For example, they said that his most recent fight was shown on DAZN, a paid-for subscription service which was not directly available to under-18s. They acknowledged that the fight was later uploaded to YouTube, but said that viewing figures did not indicate that people below the age of 18 had watched it.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications for gambling products must not be likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture. They must not include a person or character whose example was likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who had strong appeal to those aged under 18. The ASA expected advertisers to provide evidence that they had identified what persons or characters were generally known for outside the context of an ad, and had used appropriate sources of data and information to assess their likely level of appeal to under-18s. Because the ads appeared in a medium where under-18s could not be entirely excluded from the audience, they needed to comply with that rule. CAP guidance stated that sportspeople involved in clearly adult-oriented sports who were ‘notable’ stars with significant social media and general profiles which made them well-known to under-18s were likely to be of ‘moderate risk’ of strong appeal to under-18s and stated that they would be assessed on the basis of their social and other media profile. CAP guidance also stated that sports like boxing were more adult-oriented and unlikely to be of inherent ‘strong’ appeal to children. That was due to a number of factors, including because UK government statistics outlined that the proportion of children participating in boxing was low. We also noted that live boxing was often broadcast later at night and often only accessible on pay-per-view channels. Although we acknowledged that some children would still have an interest in boxing, we considered that it was an adult-oriented sport and one that generally had low appeal to under-18s. We therefore assessed the appeal that Mr Joshua was likely to have to under-18s based on his social and other media profile. Mr Joshua was a 33-year-old former world champion boxer who was considered a high profile ‘star’ in the sport. He had not held a championship title of any type since 2021, but he was still considered one of the most well-known British boxers. He was a two-time former unified heavyweight champion of the world, having held most of the boxing titles between 2016 and 2021. He had been ranked among the world’s top 10 boxers since 2014. He also won a gold medal at the Olympics in 2012. We considered that, although he would still be considered widely recognisable and a notable ‘star’ of boxing, he was nearing the end of his career. However, due to his success and celebrity status, he would likely still have been considered as an influential figure and a notable star within the sport. We then assessed Mr Joshua’s social and other media profiles. We understood that he had appeared on a number of talk shows. For example, he appeared on the Graham Norton show in 2017, A League of Their Own in 2019, Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway in 2020 and The Jonathan Ross Show in 2021. He had appeared on many sports related shows, including Gary Neville’s The Overlap in 2021 as well as various Sky Sports shows. His career had been a point of discussion on national news and sports channels and in newspapers for over a decade. Although he had been a storyteller in a CBeebies Bedtime Story in 2022, we considered most of the programmes he appeared in were primarily aimed at adult audiences and that the majority of his other media appearances were focused around boxing, a sport which, as previously stated, was not likely to be of strong appeal to children. We considered that some of his commercial relationships were with adult-focused brands, such as Jaguar Land Rover, William Hill and Hugo Boss. However, he also had endorsement deals with brands including Under Armour, Beats By Dre and JD Sports, which we considered would have also been popular with under-18s. Based on his extensive media appearances and marketability, we considered Mr Joshua had a significant media profile in general. As per the CAP Guidance, we therefore considered Mr Joshua to be in the ‘moderate risk’ of strong appeal to under-18s category and went on to assess his social media profiles.In terms of his social media presence, we understood that Mr Joshua had accounts on Twitter/X, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube. He had a total of 29.3 million followers across all platforms. Given that Mr Joshua was a prominent celebrity within the UK, we considered it was appropriate to assess the total number of under-18 followers on each of his social media platforms. Of Mr Joshua’s 15.7 million Instagram followers, approximately 6.6% were registered as under 18, which amounted to approximately 1 million users. Of his 1.6 million Snapchat followers, approximately 5% were registered as under 18, which amounted to approximately 82,000 users. Of his 764,000 YouTube followers, approximately 0.9% were registered as under 18, which amounted to approximately 6,900 users. Betfred said none of his followers on TikTok, Twitter/X or Facebook were registered as being under 18. Therefore across his active social media accounts he had at least 1.1 million followers worldwide who were aged under 18, which we considered to be a substantially high number. We acknowledged Betfred’s view that only UK specific data should be considered. They were unable to provide UK data on each social media platform specifically and we had not seen evidence that age breakdowns in the UK would mirror worldwide figures (3.85%). In any case, if Betfred’s estimation was accurate, we considered at least 280,000 followers (likely to be higher due to the absence of UK Snapchat data) aged under 18 was still a significant number in absolute terms. The CAP Guidance stated, “a generally high social media following that attracts a significant absolute number of under 18 followers, as determined through quantitative or qualitative analysis, is likely to be considered an indicator of 'strong' appeal”. Although they made up a small proportion of his total followers, we considered that over 1.1 million followers aged under 18 was a significant number in absolute terms. We therefore considered that because he had such large numbers of social media followers who were under 18, Mr Joshua was of inherent strong appeal to under-18s. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1, 16.3 and 16.3.12 (Gambling).",The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Petfre (Gibraltar) Ltd t/a Betfred not to include a person or character who had strong appeal to those under 18 years of age in their advertising in future.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/petfre--gibraltar--ltd-a23-1197806-petfre--gibraltar--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Shenzhen Guangming District Kangshuo E-Commerce Firm t/a Health Support Store,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for ad from a store on the AliExpress website, www.aliexpress.com, seen on 27 July 2023, displayed alongside product listings which were returned following a search for “belly button slimming patches”. The ad included the headline text “Lose weight” with smaller text underneath that stated “Accidentally thin”. A photo on the left showed the torso of an overweight woman with text underneath that stated “before”. A photo on the right-hand side showed a woman, shown full length from behind wearing only pants, whose spine, shoulder blades and ribs were very prominent, and with very thin arms and legs. The price and the text “Slimming Detox Lose Weight Prod...” were shown underneath.","The ASA challenged whether the ad: 1. was irresponsible, because the featured model appeared unhealthily thin; and 2. made medicinal claims for an unlicensed product.","1. & 2. Shenzhen Guangming District Kangshuo E-Commerce Firm t/a Health Support Store did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. Alibaba Group, who owned the AliExpress website, said they had removed the ad. They had also flagged the image to prevent it, or similar images, being used in ads by other businesses on their platform. They would pay additional attention to ads relating to weight loss products in future, and were looking further into the requirements of the Code in relation to the use of medicinal claims for unlicensed products. They further confirmed that they were planning to announce a ban on product listings involving improper or misleading advertising for medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products on AliExpress and were in the process of reviewing their internal procedures accordingly.","Upheld The ASA was concerned by Shenzhen Guangming District Kangshuo E-Commerce Firm’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. 1. Upheld The ad included a photo of a woman who was so thin she appeared skeletal and malnourished. The image was presented as the “after” result of using the advertised product to lose weight and be “Accidentally thin”. It was displayed to users of AliExpress who had searched for products to help with slimming. The ASA considered the ad had the effect of normalising the aspiration to be dangerously thin, and encouraging those who saw it to have that aspiration. We further considered it encouraged people to purchase unlicensed and potentially unsafe products (see below) to achieve extreme weight loss. We concluded the ad was socially irresponsible. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition12) rule 1.3 (Responsible advertising). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that medicines must have a licence from the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency), VMD (Veterinary Medicines Directorate) or under the auspices of the EMA (European Medicines Agency) before they were marketed. We noted that unlicensed medicines had not been assessed for efficacy, quality or safety. The MHRA confirmed that, because the ad made medicinal claims for the product, it fell within the definition of a medicinal product. The product was not licensed by the MHRA and therefore was an unlicensed medicine. The ad claimed that the product would cause weight loss, which was a medicinal claim; the product therefore was a medicinal product which must be licensed. Because the ad promoted an unlicensed medicine, we concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Shenzhen Guangming District Kangshuo E-Commerce Firm t/a Health Support Store to ensure the images used in their ads were prepared responsibly and did not portray dangerously or unhealthily thin people. We also told them not to advertise unlicensed medicines to the public.

ASA Ruling on THG Nutrition Limited t/a My Protein,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A TikTok post from MyProtein, seen on 14 January 2023, featured a person speaking to the camera. They said, “2023 is your year and you’re already ready to smash your goals. For that extra motivation MyProtein is running a TikTok competition with your chance to win big. Whatever you’re into or looking to get into this year, whether it’s cycling, boxing, gymnastics or running like me, we want you to capture your journey using our filter.” At the same time, text flashed up on the screen stating “I AM A CYCLIST”, “I AM A BOXER”, “I AM A GYMNAST”, “I AM A RUNNER”. The presenter continued, “No matter what point you’re at. And tag MyProtein to be in with a chance of winning some amazing prizes. They’ve got stuff like a luxury yoga retreat in Morocco, Mirafit flat weight equipment, an Apple watch, and much much more. So get creating and tag us in any videos you make with the filter. Good luck!” Text in the video stated “#YOUREALREADYREADY”. A caption on the post stated ""2023 is your year to smash your goals!! #yourealreadyready #Myprotein #Yoga #Running # Swimmimg [sic] #Gymnastics"".","1. The complainant, who asked MyProtein for a list of winners but was not provided with one and doubted that the prizes had been awarded, challenged whether the promotion breached the Code. 2. The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it omitted the significant conditions of the promotion.","1. THG Nutrition Ltd t/a MyProtein explained that there were three prize bundles available to be won. First, there was a ‘Running Prize Bundle’ which consisted of Saloman tailor made running shoes, Freetrain v1 running vest, MyProtein Clear Whey electrolytes, MyProtein BCAA Energy Drinks (6 pack), Apple Watch SE and MP Velocity clothing range. Second, there was a ‘Yoga Prize Bundle’ which consisted of a luxury 5* retreat in Morocco, one year’s membership for unlimited digital yoga classes, MP Composure clothing range, MP Composure yoga mat, MP Recovery yoga mat and MyProtein yoga block. Third, there was a ‘Weightlifting Prize Bundle’ which consisted of a Mirafit flat weight bench and hex weight, Pulseroll massage gun, Apple Watch SE, a year’s supply of MyProtein Clear Whey, a year’s supply of MyProtein’s Creatine Monohydrate, a one year’s membership of the FIIT app and MP Temp clothing range. The prize bundles were available to be awarded and the intention was that one winner would be selected for each category. They understood that following changes in the law on data protection, they were not obliged to publish or make available the full name and details of prize winners, but they were obliged to publish and make available information that indicated that a valid award had taken place. They provided the name and TikTok handle of the person who had been awarded the Running Prize Bundle and confirmed that the winner of that prize bundle had been announced on the MyProtein TikTok account. However, they explained that, because of the reasons set out in 2. below, winners for the Yoga Prize Bundle and Weightlifting Prize Bundle had not been selected and those prizes had not, therefore, been awarded. They said that having become aware of the issue, they had reviewed the entrants again and had now awarded the Yoga Prize Bundle and Weightlifting Prize Bundle (or an appropriate alternative prize, equivalent to the value of the original prizes advertised) to one winner in each category who had met the criteria that were specified in the terms and conditions. 2. MyProtein explained that having reviewed the prize promotion, it was clear that unfortunately certain conditions were omitted from the TikTok post itself. Whilst the terms and conditions posted on the advertiser’s website set out details of the three prize bundles, the post itself did not. Furthermore, they accepted that neither the TikTok post nor the terms on the website set out the full eligibility criteria, which were (i) use the appropriate TikTok filter according to which prize category they were entering (running, yoga or weightlifting), (ii) tag the MyProtein account in their entry, and (iii) be following the MyProtein account. Their social media team responsible for reviewing entries and selecting winners did so on the basis of the eligibility criteria. The omission of the full eligibility criteria had resulted in there being no valid entries for the Yoga Prize Bundle and the Weightlifting Prize Bundle and accordingly no prize had been awarded for those categories. They said they had issued training materials on the relevant parts of the CAP Code to their marketing and social media teams and would continue to carry out spot checks on promotions run on social media platforms to ensure they were compliant with the CAP Code. TikTok explained that the post appeared in two different formats: a Spark ad (i.e. boosted organic content) and a non-Spark ad, both of which were VSP-controlled advertising. They said the Spark ad was not linked to a landing page. The non-Spark ad was linked to a landing page, but because it did not disclose the terms and conditions of the promotion or provide a link to them, they concluded that the post violated their ad policies and they had removed it from the platform.","1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that promoters must conduct their promotions equitably, promptly and efficiently, be seen to deal fairly and honourably with participants, and avoid causing unnecessary disappointment. Promoters must ensure that their promotions are conducted under proper supervision, and that they make adequate resources available to administer them, to avoid giving consumers justifiable grounds for complaint. The CAP Code, which reflected the current legal requirements, also required that promoters must award the prizes as described in their ads or reasonable equivalents, and stated that withholding prizes was justified only if participants had not met the qualifying criteria set out clearly in the rules of the promotion. Promoters must either publish or make available information that indicates that a valid award took place – ordinarily the surname and county of major prizewinners and, if applicable, their winning entries. They must also inform entrants at or before the time of entry of their intention to publish or make available the information and give them the opportunity to object to this or to reduce the amount of information published or made available. In such circumstances, the promoter must nevertheless still provide the information and winning entry to the ASA if challenged. The ASA understood that there were three categories of prize bundles: running, yoga and weightlifting and that one winner would be selected for each of the three categories. We understood that one winner had been selected for the Runing Prize Bundle and had been awarded their prize. We had been provided with the name and TikTok handle of that winner. However, we understood that no winners had been selected for the Yoga Prize Bundle or the Weightlifting Prize Bundle because there were no entries for those categories that had fulfilled all three eligibility requirements. We considered that the ad did not clearly set out the qualifying criteria. Whilst it did make sufficiently clear that one of the entry requirements was to tag MyProtein in any video submitted, we considered that the ad did not make sufficiently clear the other two entry requirements, namely, the requirement to use the appropriate filter depending on the particular prize category they were entering and the requirement to follow MyProtein’s TikTok account. Although we acknowledged that the ad referred to “capture your journey using our filter” and “tag us in any video you make with the filter”, we considered that did not sufficiently explain which filter they were referring to and that there was more than one filter to reflect the different prize categories. Because the ad did not clearly set out the qualifying criteria, we considered it was not justified for MyProtein not to select and award the Yoga Prize Bundle and Weightlifting Prize Bundle from the entries that had been received. We considered that by not awarding the prizes for the reasons given, MyProtein had not dealt fairly with participants and had caused unnecessary disappointment to participants. We also considered that MyProtein had failed to publish or make available information that a valid award had taken place for the Running Prize Bundle. For those reasons, we concluded that the prize promotion had breached the Code. On that point, the promotion breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.2, 8.15.1 (Promotional marketing) and 8.28.5 (Prize promotions). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that all marketing communications referring to promotions must communicate all applicable significant conditions or information where the omission of such conditions or information is likely to mislead. Significant conditions or information may, depending on the circumstances, include information about how to participate, a closing date, the number and nature of prizes to be won and whether they were to be awarded in instalments or to be shared among recipients. The Code also stated that marketing communications that include a promotion and are significantly limited by time or space must include as much information about significant conditions as practicable and must direct consumers clearly to an easily accessible alternative source where all the significant conditions of the promotion are prominently stated. Participants should be able to retain those conditions or easily access them throughout the promotion. As stated in point 1, we understood that there were three prize bundles to be won: a Running Prize Bundle, a Yoga Prize Bundle and a Weightlifting Prize Bundle. We understood from the terms and conditions on MyProtein’s website that it was intended that one winner would be selected from each category at the end of each calendar month and winners would be announced by MyProtein ambassadors on TikTok. They would then have five working days in which to reply to claim their prize. We also understood from those terms and conditions that the closing date was 31 March at 12pm GMT, that entrants must be 18 or over and living in the UK and must be following @myprotein on TikTok to be eligible. We considered those were significant conditions which were likely to influence consumers’ understanding of the promotion and their decision to participate. Therefore, we considered the omission of that information from the ad was likely to mislead. We also considered that information about the number and nature of the prize bundles available (including the individual prizes and that they would be awarded to one winner as a bundle, for each of the three categories) as well as information about which filter to use and how prize winners were to be selected were significant conditions likely to influence consumers’ understanding of the promotion and their decision to participate. For example, it was not clear from the ad how winners from each category would be selected; whether it would be a random selection or based on their skill at performing the activity in their video submitted. It was also not clear from the ad which referred to “the filter” and “our filter”, that there were different filters for each of the three categories. The ad also referred to activities that were not one of the three categories such as boxing and cycling. We considered that the TikTok post was not sufficiently limited by time or space to justify the omission of the significant conditions of the promotion from the ad itself and the omission of those significant conditions from the ad was likely to mislead participants or potential participants. We therefore concluded that the ad breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.17, 8.17.1, 8.17.4a, 8.17.6, 8.17.6b and 8.18 (Significant conditions for promotions).","The promotion must not be run again in the form complained of. We told THG Nutrition Ltd t/a MyProtein to ensure that in future promotions they awarded the prizes as described in their ads or reasonable equivalents, and did not withhold prizes unless justified, i.e., where participants had not met the qualifying criteria set out clearly in the rules of the promotion. We also told them to ensure they either published or made available information that indicated that a valid award had taken place and included in their ads significant conditions or information about the promotion, where the omission of such conditions or information was likely to mislead.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/thg-nutrition-limited-a23-1198333-thg-nutrition-limited.html
ASA Ruling on TheGreatEvape Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for TikTok ad for The Greatevape.com, seen in July 2023, featured a video of a military-style badge and silhouetted figures marching while music played. Superimposed text stated “ENDLESS FLAVORS, LIMITLESS CHOICE FAST UK DELIVERY UNBEATABLE PRICES THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS THEGREATEVAPE.COM”.",The ASA challenged whether: 1. the ad breached the Code by directly or indirectly promoting unlicensed nicotine-containing e-liquids and their components in online media; and 2. TikTok had breached the rules for Video Sharing Platforms regulated by statute by including an ad for electronic cigarettes.,"1. The Greatevape.com said they took full responsibility for any oversight, and that their internal investigation had found no intentional violation of the advertising rules. They were in the process of reviewing their advertising practices and implementing measures to ensure stricter compliance. Those measures included enhanced employee training and regular audits to prevent any future breaches. 2. TikTok said they took their responsibilities as a Video Sharing Platform (VSP) very seriously and were committed to keeping users safe from inappropriate paid advertising. They said the promotion of e-cigarettes was prohibited under their Advertising Policies and confirmed that the ad had been removed from the platform. They had established that an element of their moderation systems did not identify the ad as a vape promotion and prohibit it accordingly. Vapes might appear to resemble pens, highlighters, lipstick tubes and even toys and so at times raised challenges for moderation models. Since the ad in question had a very small circulation, generating fewer than 1,000 views before it was removed, it did not trigger additional rounds of moderation. TikTok added that they were continuing to review and enhance their moderation systems as part of their internal quality assurance process. They were also committed to engaging with external bodies to identify regulatory challenges and develop partnerships to educate TikTok users about the risks of such products.","1. Upheld CAP Code rule 22.12 reflected a legislative ban contained in the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations (TRPR) on the advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes in certain media. The rule stated that, except for media targeted exclusively to the trade, marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components that were not licensed as medicines were not permitted in newspapers, magazines and periodicals, or in online media and some other forms of electronic media. The CAP guidance “Electronic cigarette advertising prohibitions” (the Guidance) explained that the prohibition on ads in “online media and some other forms of electronic media” reflected the legal prohibition on ads in “information society services”. The Guidance indicated that ads placed in paid-for social media placements, advertisement features and contextually targeted branded content were likely to be prohibited. Under the CAP Code, marketers were responsible for ensuring that their ads were compliant. The ASA considered whether the ad directly or indirectly promoted a nicotine-containing e-cigarette. We considered that the ad contained promotional content for the product and consequently the restriction that applied to online media under rule 22.12 was applicable. We acknowledged that the Greatevape.com had placed the ad in error. However, because the ad had the direct or indirect effect of promoting e-cigarettes that were not licensed as medicines in non-permitted media, we concluded that it breached the CAP Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 22.12 (Electronic cigarettes). 2. Upheld VSP Appendix rule 31.3.b stated that advertisements for electronic cigarettes and electronic cigarette refill containers were prohibited. That rule applied to advertising that was “marketed, sold or arranged” by VSPs that were subject to statutory regulation in the UK under the Communications Act 2003 (as amended). As a VSP in UK jurisdiction, TikTok was responsible for ensuring that ads appearing in paid-for space on its platform complied with the Appendix rules. We acknowledged that TikTok’s moderation system had on this occasion not identified the ad as an e-cigarette promotion and that once notified they had taken swift action to remove it. However, because the ad was for a prohibited product, we concluded that it breached the VSP Appendix. On that point, the ad breached VSP Appendix rule 31.3.b.",The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told The Greatevape.com that marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components which were not licensed as medicines should not appear in online media. We reminded TikTok of their responsibility under the VSP Appendix to ensure that ads for electronic cigarettes did not appear on their platform.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/thegreatevape-ltd-a23-1207694-thegreatevape-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Whaleco UK Ltd t/a Temu,"Summary of Council decision: Four issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","Four display ads and an in-app ad for Temu, an online marketplace: a. The first display ad seen on a regional online newspaper on 19 June 2023, featured six images in a row. The first image was of a young girl wearing a bikini, the girl was shown looking at the camera, one hand on her hip and the other pushing her hair behind her ear. The second image was of a woman wearing a white halterneck dress, the image was cut so only her torso and arms were shown. The third image was of a silver metallic facial roller. The fourth image was of three balloon tying tools in pink, red and blue colours. The fifth image was a woman wearing a white crop top. Only the woman’s chest, arms and midriff were shown. The sixth image was of a grey jock strap. b. The second display ad seen on a chess website on 18 June 2023, featured six images. The first image featured a woman wearing a burgundy one shoulder jumpsuit that was cut at one side showing part of the woman’s midriff, the top of her chest and her left arm. The image was cut just below the woman’s eyes, showing the bottom part of her face only. The second image was of padded cycling underwear. The third image was of three balloon tying tools in pink, red and blue. The fourth image was a woman wearing a grey tight fitting jumpsuit. The image was cut to show her face from the eyes down to the top part of her thighs only. The fifth image was of a grey jock strap. The sixth image was a pair of red boots. c. The third display ad seen on a chess website on 17 June 2023, featured three of the images seen in ad (b); the woman wearing a burgundy jumpsuit, padded cycling underwear and three balloon tying tools in pink, red and blue. d. The fourth display ad seen on a language translation website on 18 June 2023, featured eight images. Five that were also in ad (b); three balloon tying tools in pink, red and blue, padded cycling underwear, a woman wearing a burgundy jumpsuit, a pair of red boots and a woman wearing a grey jumpsuit. The sixth image was featured in ad (a) and was a woman wearing a white halterneck dress. The seventh image was of a woman wearing a tight fitting pink cat suit, the woman’s head was not shown. The eighth image was of a rubber pink foot massager. e. The in-app ad seen within a puzzle app on the 18 June 2023, featured images of leopard print underwear with the back removed and a woman wearing a short black skirt and tights, only the woman’s legs were shown.","The ASA received five complaints. 1. Three complainants, who considered that the content of ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) were sexually graphic, objected that the ads were likely to cause serious or widespread offence. 2. One complainant, who believed the pose and clothing of the model in a bikini, sexualised someone who was a child, challenged whether ad (a) was irresponsible and offensive. 3. Two complainants, who believed ads (a), (b) and (c) sexually objectified women, challenged whether they were offensive and irresponsible. 4. Two complainants challenged whether ads (b), (c) and (e) were inappropriately targeted.","1. Whaleco UK Ltd t/a Temu said they were a global online platform, launched in the United Kingdom in 2023. Third-party sellers listed and sold a wide range of products on their marketplace. The product descriptions, including the images, displayed on the marketplace were provided by the third parties. Sellers were obliged to adhere to Temu’s marketplace policies which prohibited pornographic, obscene or harassing images. Regarding the silver metallic facial roller, balloon tying tools, padded cycling underwear, jock strap, red boots and foot massager, Temu said the images shown were the products in their original state unaltered. They were found on the manufacturer’s website and other e-commerce platforms. They believed the images were not sexual or offensive. Bylines Network, the regional newspaper publisher where ad (a) appeared, stated they had strict controls to prevent inappropriate advertising and proactively blocked sensitive content. However, as the ad was listed as a shopping site the content had been permitted. They stated that the advertiser was selling items they did not want displayed on their platforms and they had now blocked Temu from future advertising on their websites. The chess website, where ads (b) and (c) appeared, explained that while they did not operate direct control over what companies advertise on their website, they did put in place strict guidelines for their third-party Ad Management Partner (AMP) to ensure that images with sexual content, gambling, alcohol or any other categories seen as inappropriate for the general public were prohibited. The AMP was then responsible for ensuring compliance with the guidelines. They believed Temu, as an e-commerce platform, was not considered a part of any banned category. However, after reviewing the ads, they confirmed the images displayed did not align with their values and therefore, had contacted their AMP to prevent Temu ads being shown on their platform again. In addition, they had asked their AMP that similar content and images would not be shown on their website again. 2. Temu explained that the image of the child in the bikini in ad (a) was provided by the seller and violated Temu’s marketing policy. The image had been removed from their Google Ads account and would not be shown again. 3. Temu said that images of models without a face were not intended to sexually objectify the women. The pictures were there to show customers a clear representation of how the clothing was worn and helped them to select goods to purchase. They explained that a similar approach could be found on other e-commerce platforms. They said the images contained no description or language that sexually objectified women. They had not used the women’s features as a way to draw attention to an unrelated product. The clothes themselves did not feature any offensive words or slogans. The images further had not focused on the model’s specific body parts and had not been presented in such a way as to feel voyeuristic. The models were all appropriately dressed and were not posed in a sexual way. 4. Temu said all the ads were served by Google Ads. Over one million product descriptions and images were uploaded to their Google Ads account, labelled by product category, price range and sales volume. Temu chose the product categories to be promoted and Google Ads used their algorithm to pick products from that category and serve them. If Temu did not pick an ad category, Google Ads would select the most appropriate one from all product categories. Temu said they did not get to decide the specific products advertised, the arrangement or combination of products or the websites/apps that the ads were displayed on.","1. Upheld The disputed images were a silver metallic facial roller, which appeared in ad (a), balloon ties, that appeared in ads (a), (b), (c) and (d), a jockstrap, found in ads (a) and (b), cycling underwear, that appeared in ads (b), (c) and (d) and a foot massager, found in ad (d) only. All the objects in the ads were therefore either underwear or household products. However, no accompanying text, explanation or context was given about the items. Therefore, the nature of the products and their original intended use, were not easily identifiable. Both the facial roller and balloon ties were phallic shaped and in the absence of any explanation could have been interpreted as sexual in nature. The foot massager, which was plastic and tapered to a round end, could also have been understood in the same way. Regarding the underwear, the jockstrap was augmented in the crotch, emphasising the outline of genitalia. The cycling underwear, which had pink padding at the back, was not immediately clear it was for cycling and appeared as underwear with the bottom cut out. Both items, especially juxtaposed with the other products, appeared to be sexual in nature, rather than functional underwear. The disputed images in ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) all appeared alongside images of adult women wearing tight fitting clothing that accentuated their body shape. While the portrayals of the women in isolation were not necessarily sexual, the styling of the images, including the revealing nature of the clothing, meant that their inclusion alongside products that appeared to be sexual in nature, added to the impression that the items and underwear were meant for an adult purpose, rather than functional objects. Ad (a) appeared on a regional online newspaper, ads (b) and (c) were seen on a chess website and ad (d) was found on a translation website. They were websites for general use and did not contain adult themed products or services of a sexual nature. The ASA noted Temu’s explanation that the items had not been chosen directly by them but picked by their ad server’s algorithm based on very broad product categories. However, while we acknowledged that Temu had stated there had been no intent to curate the ads in a sexual way, we assessed how they were likely to be interpreted by readers, regardless of the mechanics behind them. We considered that ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) taken in their entirety with the accompanying images of the models, and with no explanation or labelling, contained products that were likely to be seen as sexual in nature. The ads appeared in general media where adult themed or sexual products were unlikely to be anticipated. On that basis the ads were likely to cause widespread offence. On that point, ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) breached CAP code (Edition 12) rule 4.1 (Harm and offence). 2. Upheld We considered that the young model in ad (b) appeared to be a girl of eight to eleven years of age. The girl wore a two piece bikini. The image was cut off just beneath the bikini bottoms. The girl was posed with one hand on her hip and the other appearing to push her hair behind her ears. The pose was quite adult for a girl of her age and she appeared alongside two other images also in the ad that featured mature women modelling clothing intended for adults. We noted further the facial roller, balloon ties and jockstrap that were also displayed in the same ad. The lack of explanation and labelling meant that both the facial roller and balloon ties appeared to be items sexual in nature. Further to that the jockstrap, with its accentuated crotch, gave the impression of being sexual, rather than for utility. The collection of items portrayed together added to the impression that the ad was of a sexual nature and by association, therefore, the girl was sexualised. We concluded that the ad had the effect of portraying a child in a sexual way and was irresponsible. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social Responsibility) and 4.8 (Harm and offence). 3. Upheld Ad (a) showed a woman wearing a tight-fitting white dress, the image was cut so only her torso and arms were shown. A second image featured a woman wearing a white crop top and only her chest, arms and midriff were shown. The images appeared alongside a jockstrap and items such as a facial massager and balloon ties, which were phallic in shape and appeared sexual in nature. Further to that the jockstrap, with its accentuated crotch, gave the impression of being sexual, rather than for utility. Focusing on a person’s body while obscuring or removing their face was likely to be seen as objectifying. As the disembodied images of the women wearing tight and revealing clothing appeared alongside items that were likely to be understood as sexual, we considered the women were presented as stereotypical sexual objects. Ads (b) and (c) showed a woman wearing a one shoulder jumpsuit that was cut at one side exposing part of her midriff, the top of her chest and her left arm. A second image in ad (b) was of a woman wearing a tight fitting jumpsuit. We noted that the first image included the woman’s face from her nose downwards and the second image included her face from her eyes downwards. Therefore, unlike the models in ad (a), the women were represented more fully, rather than as reduced body parts. However, we again noted the context of the ads overall, with the accompanying images of a jockstrap in ad (b) and cycling underwear and the balloon tie in ads (b) and (c). We understood that the cycling underwear, in the absence of explanatory text or explanation, would be interpreted as underwear but not necessarily for cycling and noted the padded section appeared that there was a hole in the bottom and could have been seen as sexual. Further to that, the phallic shaped balloon tie and the jockstrap with the augmented crotch would have been seen as sexual in nature. The overall impression of the ads was that they featured sexual imagery of which the women in tight fitting, partially revealing clothing played a part. The women in ads (b) and (c) were therefore presented as stereotypical sexual objects. On that point, ads (a), (b) and (c) breached CAP code (Edition 12) rules 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence). 4. Upheld We considered that ads (b) and (c) featured content that sexually objectified women and ad (b) featured an image of a person under 18 years of age in a sexual way. Therefore they were unsuitable to be seen by audiences of any age, regardless of whether the advertiser had taken steps to target them towards audiences over 18. Ad (e) showed an image of backless leopard print underwear and we considered that the ad would be interpreted as promoting underwear of an adult nature. We therefore expected Temu to have targeted the ad responsibly including limiting the audience to users aged 18 years and over. That should have been achieved using age verification measures including interest-based targeting factors that described an adult audience and excluded a child audience. The puzzle app where ad (e) was served, was rated as “EVERYONE” in the Google Play App Store – meaning it was generally considered suitable for all age groups. Concerning ads (b) and (c) they appeared on a website for playing chess. We understood that chess had a wide appeal and so those under 18 would make up a significant number of those on the site. We understood that ads for Temu would not be served to those who were explicitly known to their ad server as under 18. However, if the user had an undeclared age they could be served any Temu ad and this included users of both the puzzle app and the chess website. Because ads (b) and (c) included objectifying material and we had not seen evidence to demonstrate that Temu had taken appropriate action to minimise the risk of under-18s being served for all the ads, for instance by using interest-based targeting factors, we concluded that they had not been responsibly targeted. On that point, ads (b), (c) and (e) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social Responsibility).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Whaleco UK Ltd t/a Temu to ensure that future ads were prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society and that they did not cause serious or widespread offence by presenting products in a sexual way in general media or by presenting individuals as stereotypical sexual objects. In addition, persons who were or appeared to be under 18 years of age in ads must not be portrayed in a sexual way and ads must be responsibly targeted.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/whaleco-uk-ltd-g23-1202845-whaleco-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Hurtigruten UK Ltd t/a Hurtigruten,,"A website for Hurtigruten, www.hurtigruten.com, an expedition cruise company, seen on 6 June 2023, featured text stating, “Northen Lights Expedition Cruise from London”. Crossed out text below stated, “Price from £4,932”. A new price of £1,994 was shown in larger text below.","The complainant, who had previously booked the cruise at a lower price than £4,932 and had never seen it sold at that price, challenged whether the savings claim was misleading.",Hurtigruten Ltd said the savings claim was pulled from the wrong location on the website due to a recent change in IT systems. They said they would correct the IT error as a matter of urgency. They explained that the incorrect savings claim affected only one cabin category on the cruise and that they did not intend to publish misleading savings claims.,"Upheld The ASA considered that consumers would understand the crossed-out price of £4,932 to represent the price at which the cruise was usually sold and therefore they would be able to make significant savings by purchasing the cruise at the discounted price of £1,994. We understood that the crossed-out price had been included in error due to an IT issue and we welcomed the action of Hurtigruten to correct the error as soon as they became aware of it. However, because Hurtigruten were unable to supply evidence that showed that £4,932 was the established usual selling price of the cruise and that the price reduction represented a genuine saving for consumers, we concluded that the ad was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (Prices).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Hurtigruten Ltd to ensure their future savings claims did not mislead by including a crossed-out price that was not the usual selling price of the cruise.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/hurtigruten-uk-ltd-a23-1202064-hurtigruten-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd t/a Royal Caribbean International,,"A website for Royal Caribbean Cruises, www.royalcaribbean.com, seen on 13 May 2023: a. A search results webpage featured a cruise named “7 Night Italy Greece & Croatia”. Text below stated “Leaving from: Venice (Ravenna), Italy” and “Visiting: Venice (Ravenna), Italy, Dubrovnik, Croatia […] Sicily (Messina), Italy”. b. The cruise itinerary page featured text “THIS IS YOUR 7 Night Italy, Greece & Croatia […]” and “ Leaving from Venice (Ravenna), Italy”. The page included a list of departure locations and times that included the text “Day 1 Port Venice (Ravenna), Italy Departs at 6:00PM”.","The complainant, who understood Ravenna was over two hours away from Venice by car, challenged whether the claims relating to the location of the port were misleading.","Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd said cruise ships were banned from docking in Venice and therefore were required to use whatever alternative cruise port was available to provide reasonable access to Venice and other regional attractions. They said that “Venice (Ravenna)” was used consistently in their webpages, and that the use of “Ravenna” as the qualification clarified that the ship did not dock or depart from the Port of Venice. They added that their booking materials did not suggest the ship would be docked in the Port of Venice. They believed that the use of qualifying words or place names was common practice in the travel industry and was well understood by the average consumer, and proposed reversing the qualification to “Ravenna (Venice)”. They explained that, since most of their guests were mainly from the US, many were familiar with Venice, but not Ravenna. Therefore, they suggested that consumers would be less likely to book the cruise unless Venice was featured prominently, whilst using Ravenna to qualify the docking port. They said they understood that there was a potential for consumer confusion, but they had always provided sufficient information to consumers regarding the departure point and itinerary before they booked the cruise.","Upheld Both ads promoted the same cruise, and stated “Leaving from: Venice (Ravenna), Italy”. The ASA considered the claim “Leaving from Venice (Ravenna)” would be interpreted by consumers to mean that the cruise would depart from a port in Venice. We considered that consumers were likely to understand that “Ravenna” was included to give a more specific location within Venice from which the cruise would depart. Ad (b) listed the ports the cruise left from, with the first port listed as “Venice (Ravenna)” as well as a further port that was listed using similar qualifying brackets as “Sicily (Messina)”. Since Messina was a place within Sicily, we considered this further added to the impression that Ravenna was a location in Venice. Consumers would likely assume they could travel to Venice to join the cruise at its departure port. However, we understood that both cities were independent ports that were distinct from one another. Venice was the capital of the Veneto region, whilst Ravenna was situated in the Emilia-Romagna region, and was approximately 90 miles away, with a journey time of over two hours by car. In order to reach the departure point, consumers who travelled to Venice would need to arrange separate transport to reach the actual departure port, which was a significant distance away. We noted there was an information page within the website that provided further information about Ravenna and within this the distance travel time of over 2 hours was detailed. However, we understood it was possible to reach the booking process without accessing that information and we considered that was information that consumers needed to know before deciding to proceed. In any case, such a qualification was likely to contradict rather than qualify the claim. We acknowledged that Royal Caribbean Cruises had proposed to reverse the qualification so that the ad stated “Ravenna (Venice)”. However, we considered that was still likely to be interpreted by consumers to mean that the cruise departed from Venice. Because consumers were likely to understand from the ad that the cruise would depart from Venice, and that was not the case, we concluded the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.9 (Qualification).","The ad must not appear in the form complained of. We told Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd to ensure ads made clear where cruises departed from, and not to misleadingly imply a cruise departed from or visited a particular place if that was not the case.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/royal-caribbean-cruises-ltd-a23-1198946-royal-caribbean-cruises-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Bonne Terre Ltd t/a Sky Bet,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work banning gambling ads which, under strengthened rules, are prohibited from being likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathered by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A promoted tweet for Sky Bet, posted on 9 February 2023, contained an embedded video clip from The Overlap football podcast. The video showed Gary Neville discussing which team might win the Premier League. The Sky Bet logo appeared intermittently throughout the video. On-screen text at the end stated, “BROUGHT TO YOU BY SKY BET” and the BeGambleAware logo appeared after that. Text in the caption stated, “Is Gary changing his title prediction? [eyes emoji] Thanks to Man City, It seems @GNev2 is having a change of heart [sweat grinning emoji][trophy emoji] Part three of The Overlap Fan Debate is out now [television emoji]”.","The ASA challenged whether the ad included an individual who was likely to be of strong appeal to those under 18 years of age, and therefore breached the Code.","Sky Bet said they had worked extensively with CAP to ensure their ads complied with the requirements of the Joint CAP and BCAP Advertising Guidance “Gambling and lotteries advertising: protecting under-18s” (the B/CAP Guidance). They firmly believed that Gary Neville did not hold strong appeal to under-18s. They explained that The Overlap, a YouTube series sponsored by Sky Bet and produced by Mr Neville, featured interviews with individuals from sporting, political and business backgrounds discussing contemporary sporting issues, with a focus on football. They said it was distinctly adult in tone and did not feature any content of a childish nature. The episode that featured in the tweet was made up of fan debates covering subjects such as “the impact of Ten Hag [Manchester United’s manager] and the style of football at Manchester United” and “what is going wrong at Liverpool?”. They pointed out that such pundit-based discussions had been judged in previous ASA rulings not to be of strong appeal to children. They said just 1.2% of The Overlap’s audience was aged 13-17, with that figure dropping to 0.5% for the advertised episode. They acknowledged that Gary Neville was well known for his time at Premier League club Manchester United, where he progressed from the youth team in 1991 to become club captain in 2005, a position he retained until his retirement in 2011. He was notable as one of the “Class of 92” team, which won the FA Youth Cup in 1992 and went on to form the basis of Manchester United’s highly successful senior team. They pointed out, however, that 1992 was more than 30 years ago and more than a decade before today’s 18-year-olds were even born. They added that his professional playing career had ended nearly 12 years previously, in 2011, when today’s 18-year-olds would have been five or six years old; furthermore, he had made only three Premier League appearances in the final year of his playing career. They believed that met the B/CAP Guidance’s definition of “long retired” and therefore he was at low risk of strongly appealing to under-18s. Similarly, although they acknowledged he had made a number of appearances for the England team from 1995 onwards, Mr Neville had not been a member of the England squad since 2007, and had made only one appearance in the final year of his international playing career. They cited previous ASA rulings where more recently-retired footballers who had moved into punditry had been judged not to be of strong appeal to under-18s. They believed that Gary Neville was now more widely recognisable as a football pundit, political commentator and successful businessman, and they had assessed his profile, including his social media profile, on that basis before publishing the tweet. As of March 2023, he had 5,504,262 Twitter/X followers, of which 1% were aged 13-17. Assuming the 1% were all UK-based, they said that equated to just 0.39% of the UK’s total population of under-18s. They contrasted that with the 53% of his followers who were aged 25-34. They provided details of the top 20 subjects that his followers tweeted about; those included US and domestic politics, political figures, business, finance and Government institutions. They considered those to be markedly adult in nature with nothing that denoted an interest in children’s media or topics. Of the top five hashtags used by his followers, four pertained to football but the fifth most popular was #generalelectionnow. They said that showed the very mature and politically motivated nature of his Twitter/X audience. They added that Gary Neville was 47 years old at the time the ad appeared, and that his media profile was consistent with his mature age. They added that he was well-known for being outspoken about his political views and used his social media platforms to address a broad range of social justice and political matters, once prompting a direct response from the Prime Minister in December 2022. In March 2023, 42% of his 183 tweets were related to political matters. He was frequently invited to appear on TV shows, news programmes and podcasts to discuss political topics. Having joined the Labour Party in 2022, he spoke at their conference with Sir Keir Starmer that year. Sky Bet believed Mr Neville was intrinsically connected to political matters in the public consciousness, which was unlikely to appeal to children and young people, who, they suggested, could be said to be entirely disinterested in such matters. Sky Bet said Gary Neville did not have active public personal accounts on YouTube or Twitch. They provided data to show that of his 1.6 million Instagram followers, 5% were aged 13-17. They sent audience demographics for his TikTok and Facebook accounts, but said those platforms did not publish data for individuals registered as under 18. In his capacity as a pundit for Sky and ITV, Gary Neville appeared on a range of football-themed TV shows. They pointed out that many of the programmes were scheduled later in the evening which, they believed, reduced the likelihood that they were regularly watched by children. They provided Broadcaster’s Audience Research Board (BARB) data that they said highlighted the overwhelmingly adult appeal of those programmes. They reiterated that the inherent strong appeal of football was unlikely to extend to pundit-based discussion that took place around a football game and cited a previous ASA ruling based on that rationale. While they were not able to provide demographic data for Sky Sports’ “The Gary Neville Podcast”, which contained Mr Neville’s review of the previous weekend’s footballing activity, they believed that this would not be of strong appeal to children because it focused solely on punditry. Outside of his work as a pundit, Gary Neville appeared in Sky’s “Class of 92” series of TV documentaries about Salford FC. Sky Bet said those programmes focused on the day-to-day administration of the club and its business management and were therefore adult in tone. They provided BARB data that they said demonstrated its overwhelmingly adult appeal. Mr Neville also hosted Sky’s Soccer Box TV show where he interviewed retired footballers about their careers, content which Sky Bet believed would categorically not hold strong appeal to children. He appeared in a one-off documentary called “Gary Neville in Qatar” prior to the 2022 World Cup. Sky Bet were not able to obtain demographic data from Amazon who currently aired the show, but because it appeared on a subscriber-only platform and tackled mature themes, they believed it very unlikely to appeal to children. He appeared as a guest presenter on the satirical political panel show “Have I Got News For You” in November 2022. Sky Bet sent BARB data that they believed highlighted the very limited appeal that programme had to children. They said they had assessed his current and previous endorsements, which were few and clearly targeted at an adult audience, such as a partnership with Castore (a high-performance sportwear brand for athletes), columns in the Daily Mail and The Telegraph and a number of books. As owner of a property investment company and co-owner of a hospitality management company, he was also known as a successful businessman. They believed that his co-ownership and former CEO role at EFL League 2 football team, Salford City, would not make him of strong appeal to under-18s because he operated behind the scenes at a lower-league club. They said Gary Neville had been a brand ambassador for Sky Bet since 2018 and was widely recognised for his connection to their products, which were solely targeted at adults. They confirmed that the promoted tweet had been targeted at users registered as being over 25 years old who had a known interest in sport and who would therefore be likely to be interested in The Overlap. Twitter/X believed the ad did not breach any of their current policies and said they had not received any complaints in relation to it.","Upheld From 1 October 2022, the CAP Code stated that marketing communications for gambling products must not be likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture. They must not include a person or character whose example was likely to be followed by those aged under 18 years or who had strong appeal to those aged under 18. The ASA expected advertisers to provide evidence that they had identified what persons or characters were generally known for outside the context of an ad, and had used appropriate sources of data and information to assess their likely level of appeal to under-18s. We acknowledged that the ad was targeted at over-25s, however, because it had appeared in a medium where under-18s could not be entirely excluded from the audience due to users self-verifying their age on sign-up, it needed to comply with that rule. We acknowledged that Gary Neville had achieved prominence as a Premier League and England football player; he had won eight Premier League and two Champions League titles during his long club career and had represented his country in three European Championships and two World Cups. However, he had retired from Premier League football in 2011 and had not played for England since 2007. We considered, therefore, that at the time the ad appeared he not would have been of strong appeal to children and young people due to his career as a footballer. We considered that he was now more likely to be widely recognised as a TV sports pundit. The B/CAP Guidance classed retired footballers who had moved into punditry as likely to be of ‘moderate risk’ of strong appeal to under-18s and stated that they would be assessed on the basis of their social and other media profile. We therefore assessed the appeal that Mr Neville was likely to have to under-18s on that basis. We noted he was a regular and well-known pundit on Sky Sports, appearing on several different programmes. He also featured in ITV’s football programming including World Cup coverage. The BARB data did not show that a significant proportion of viewers for any of those appearances was under 18. We also noted some of the programmes were scheduled later in the evening, post-9pm, which we considered reduced the likelihood that those programmes would be regularly watched by children. He also appeared as a pundit on Sky’s live coverage of Premier League football games, and we acknowledged that live Premier League games, along with live World Cup coverage, could be of strong appeal to under-18s. However, we considered that Gary Neville’s role as one of a group of pundits or commentators, whose discussion of performance and tactics was at a remove from the game, would not hold the same interest for young people as the roles of players and managers, who were direct participants and therefore more likely to be aspirational or influential figures to them. We therefore considered that his appearance in that context would be unlikely to hold strong appeal for under-18s. We considered that Gary Neville’s commercial partnerships and roles outside of football punditry were adult-focused. We also considered that the TV programmes and podcasts he appeared on were primarily aimed at an adult audience and were unlikely to strongly appeal to a younger audience. In terms of his social media presence, we understood that Mr Neville did not have active public personal accounts on YouTube, Twitch or Snapchat. However, he did post regularly on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter/X. Although figures for under-18 followers on TikTok and Facebook were not available, of his 1.6 million Instagram followers, 5% were registered as under 18, which amounted to 80,000 users. Of his 5,504,262 Twitter/X followers 1% were registered as under 18, which amounted to over 55,000 followers. Therefore across his active social media accounts he had at least 135,000 followers who were aged under 18. The BCAP Guidance stated, “… a generally high social media following that attracts a significant absolute number of under 18 followers, as determined through quantitative or qualitative analysis, is likely to be considered an indicator of 'strong' appeal”. Although they made up a small proportion of his total Instagram and Twitter/X followers, we considered that over 135,000 followers aged under 18 was a significant number in absolute terms.

ASA Ruling on Codeway Dijital Hizmetler Anonim Sirketi t/a Codeway,,"A paid-for Instagram post by @pixelup.app, seen on 15 May 2023, featured a black and white picture of a person which had been split into two separate images. A vertical line was in the middle of them to show that the image on the left was the original, blurred version, while the image on the right was of a higher resolution. A caption on the post stated “Enhance your Photos with AI”.","The complainant, who believed the app could not improve the quality of old images to such an extent, challenged whether the ad misleadingly exaggerated the capabilities of the product.","Codeway Dijital Hizmetler Anonim Sirketi t/a Pixelup acknowledged the complaint, but did not provide a substantive response. They said the ad in question was not used to promote their product.","Upheld The left-hand image in the ad, which the ASA considered consumers were likely to understand was the original photo, was extremely blurry. That was in stark contrast to the image on the right, which we considered consumers were likely to understand was the image after using the app, was sharp and clear. For example, in the right-hand image, the person’s facial features were clearly visible whereas they were not in the left-hand image. We considered that in the context of the ad, consumers would understand the two images as objective visual claims about the app’s capabilities. We considered that consumers would understand from the imagery, in conjunction with the claim in the caption “Enhance your photos with AI”, that they would be able to achieve similar results when using the app. We therefore expected to see evidence that the image of the original version of the photo used in the ad was genuine and had not been distorted to exaggerate the efficiency of the app, and that the sharper image had been achieved using only the app and without any additional digital enhancement. We also expected to see evidence that consumers would be able to achieve similar results when enhancing old photos using the app. Pixelup did not provide any evidence to demonstrate how the app worked or the results that could be achieved using the app. In the absence of adequate evidence to show the results featured in the ad were achievable, we concluded that the ad exaggerated the performance of the app and was therefore misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.11 (Exaggeration).",The ad must not appear again in its current form.

ASA Ruling on HMK V AG t/a Windsor Mint,THIS RULING REPLACES THAT PUBLISHED 17 MAY 2023. THE WORDING OF THE ASSESSMENT HAS CHANGED BUT THE DECISION TO UPHOLD THE COMPLAINT REMAINS.,"A TV ad for Windsor Mint, seen on 3 December 2022, promoted a coin commemorating Princess Diana. The voice-over stated, “To mark this year’s twenty-fifth anniversary of her tragic death, an exclusive gold coin has been issued […] This especial collectible has been minted in the highest quality proof in one two-hundred ounce fine gold.” On-screen text appeared which stated, “Minted in 1/200 ounce 24-carat gold”. The voice-over continued, “This 24-carat gold coin is now available for just £29.95, saving £85 on the regular price of £114.95 [...] This special offer is only available until the 31st of December.” Images of both sides of the coin appeared on-screen with the text “40 mm” underneath. The voice-over continued, “Order now […] to secure your Princess Diana fine gold coin.”",The complainant challenged whether the ad misleadingly implied that the coin was exclusively made from 24-carat gold.,"HMK V AG t/a Windsor Mint said the advertised coin weighed one two-hundredths of an ounce, and that its entire weight comprised 24-carat gold. The coin’s diameter was 40 mm, and it was 0.063 mm thick. It was produced through a special minting technique that allowed small weights of gold to be rolled out across large diameters. The coin was sealed in foil for protection but could be removed. They provided a coin to demonstrate what consumers would receive. Because the coin’s weight, diameter, and gold content were referenced by the voice-over and on-screen text, they believed that the ad accurately represented the coin’s characteristics. They provided a test report, produced by a third-party precious metal laboratory, which indicated that the purity of the gold that the coin contained was determined to be 99.97%. They also provided a certificate of authenticity from the third-party company that minted the coin. That certificate listed the coin’s weight as one two-hundredths of an ounce. They believed that the coin’s thickness would be irrelevant to viewers’ decision to purchase it. Instead, viewers’ attention would largely focus on the coin’s gold content, price, diameter, the event or individual commemorated, or the quality of any featured designs. As a dimension, the diameter of coins would be particularly important as it dictated their size upon viewing from the front. For that reason, this measure was usually quoted in ads for coins. In contrast, the thickness of coins frequently varied across their face due to the presence of raised decorative elements. As such, quoting the thickness of coins, in addition to their diameter, would not amount to a reliable indication of their overall volume. Even then, the volume of the coin would not be of primary interest to viewers because of their understanding that a coin’s weight would also depend on the density of the metal in question. On that basis, they believed the thickness of coins was not material information which ads were required to include. Because viewers would be aware that there was no standardised ratio between the diameter and thickness of coins, they would not have any expectations regarding the thickness of coins quoted as having a certain diameter. Nonetheless, they explained that, together with the density of gold, the quoted diameter and weight necessitated that the coin was very thin. However, viewers could also infer that the coin was thin on the basis that 40-mm, 24-carat gold coins were normally much more expensive than the advertised price. Clearcast supported the advertiser’s view that the ad gave an accurate overall impression of the coin. They were satisfied that the advertiser’s evidence supported the claims “Minted in one two-hundred ounce fine gold” and “24-carat gold coin”. While some viewers may not have understood the meaning of the claim “1/200 ounce fine gold”, the vast majority of viewers would understand the “24-carat gold coin” claim. They did not believe that the thickness of a coin was material information that ads needed to explicitly state. Thicker 24-carat gold coins of the same diameter tended to be considerably more expensive than the advertised product by virtue of their higher gold content. For that reason, they believed that the advertised price gave a reasonable indication of the coin’s dimensions. They added that it was rare for the thickness of commemorative coins to be explicitly indicated in ads. Because such products were collectibles, viewers interested in purchasing them were likely to have experience of other similar products and therefore be knowledgeable regarding their likely attributes. Those viewers would primarily focus on the value of coins and their appearance upon display. However, if they were specifically interested in the coin’s thickness, they would receive a fair impression via consideration of other information the ad made available.","Upheld The complainant had challenged whether the ad misleadingly implied that the coin was exclusively made from 24-carat gold, because they did not believe that to be plausible given the stated diameter of the coin. The ad referred to the product as a “gold coin” throughout and on-screen text indicated that its diameter was 40 mm. The ads’ visuals gave a flat view of the coin’s faces. Another shot depicted the coin from an angle, but in a display case so its outer edges were not visible. We considered that consumers would expect the dimensions of a product sold as a commemorative coin to resemble those of coins circulated as legal tender. While there was variation in the thickness of coins which were legal tender, in the absence of information in the ad to the contrary, consumers would not expect commemorative coins to be significantly thinner than them. Although references to weight were made in the voice-over (“one two-hundred ounce”) and on-screen text (“1/200 ounce”), those claims all appeared alongside references to the high purity of the coin. In that context, we considered consumers would not understand them as referring to the total weight of the coin. Instead, they were more likely to interpret them as additional technical references related to the gold’s purity. We therefore considered that few consumers would understand from the references to weight that the coin must therefore be very thin. While we recognised that a solid gold coin of the 40 mm size advertised would be worth significantly more than the coin’s advertised price of £29.95, the ad nonetheless gave the overall impression that it was comprised of pure gold and took the form of a typical 40 mm coin. While the test report substantiated that the coin was entirely comprised of 24-carat gold, it only weighed 0.14 g (1/200 oz) and was 0.063 mm thick. We considered those measures were very small for a 40 mm coin. For comparison, information on the Royal Mint website reflected that a 50p coin with a smaller diameter of 27.33 mm was more than 28 times as thick (1.78 mm). Likewise, a 24-carat gold coin issued by the Royal Mint with a diameter of 32.69 mm weighed 28.35 g (1 oz). Examining the sample product received, we noted that the coin itself appeared to be flexible and was laminated in thin plastic, subsequently encased in two additional layers of plastic, then housed within a square display case. We considered that the coin’s atypical thinness was material information regarding the product’s main characteristics which was likely to affect a consumer’s transactional decision. In the absence of any such information, the ad implied that the coin took the form of a typical 40 mm coin when that was not the case. We therefore concluded that the ad was misleading. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.3.1 (Misleading advertising).",The ad must not be broadcast again in the form complained of. We told HMK V AG t/a Windsor Mint to ensure their future ads did not mislead by omitting material information regarding the dimensions of coins where they differed from what consumers were likely to expect.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/hmk-v-ag-a22-1178286-hmk-v-ag-1.html
ASA Ruling on Imiracle (HK) Ltd t/a Elfbar,,"A post for Elf Bar, an electronic cigarette brand, on social media platform Discord, www.discord.com, dated 4 January 2023. The post appeared on Elf Bar’s server, “EB Planet” in a group titled “# GB | uk-website-news”, under a channel called “ELFBAR”, and stated, “Regular Discord User Discount @ United Kingdom https://www.elfbar.co.uk/” and “All UK Discord Users will enjoy 5% off on everything. Code: DISCORD5”. A circular image featured text stating, “USE CODE DISCORD5” and “5% OFF NEXT ORDER”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code by directly promoting unlicensed nicotine-containing e-liquids and their components in online media.,"Imiracle (HK) Ltd t/a Elf Bar said they considered the post was factual in nature, and it had been produced by Elf Bar’s in-house marketing team on the basis of providing material to a platform considered to be analogous to the Elf Bar UK website. They said they had considered the functionality of the Discord site and the look of the relevant channels, and believed that the material in question was published on a site that could only be found by those actively seeking it, and was not available to general unprotected or unregistered views. Elf Bar said they had, however, removed the post from Discord and welcomed further guidance on the matter from the ASA.","Upheld CAP Code rule 22.12 reflected a legislative ban contained in the Tobacco and Related Products Regulations 2016 (TRPR) on the advertising of unlicensed, nicotine-containing e-cigarettes in certain media. The rule stated that, except for media targeted exclusively to the trade, marketing communications with the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components which were not licensed as medicines were not permitted in newspapers, magazines and periodicals; or in online media and some other forms of electronic media. It further stated that factual claims about products were permitted on marketers’ own websites and, in certain circumstances, in other non-paid-for space online under the marketer’s control. We understood that, while promotional content was prohibited on retailers’ own websites, rule 22.12 specified a particular exception that the provision of factual information was not prohibited. The basis of the exception to the rule was that consumers had to specifically seek out that factual information by visiting a website, as opposed to it being actively promoted to them, as set out in the CAP guidance ‘Electronic cigarette advertising prohibitions’. We considered that, in principle, there was likely to be scope for the position relating to factual claims being acceptable on marketers’ websites to also apply to some social media activity. A social media page or account might be considered to be analogous to a website and able to make factual claims if it could only be found by those actively seeking it. We considered whether Discord was a non-paid-for online space where such advertising, using factual claims only, was permitted. The ad was posted on Discord within Elf Bar’s ‘EB Planet’ server, a space for members comprised of various channels containing chat groups, and appeared in a group related to news about Elf Bar’s UK website. We understood that the EB Planet server on Discord was accessible via invitation only, and upon accepting an invitation users joined the server and could view the content and communicate within the chat groups. Additionally, we understood that the content within Elf Bar’s server was not accessible to, or otherwise shared with, other users on Discord unless they had joined that server. Because the content in the EB Planet server could only be found by those actively seeking it, we considered Elf Bar’s server on Discord was a non-paid-for online space under the marketer’s control which was analogous to Elf Bar’s website. Therefore, we considered that factual claims about nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components were permitted in that space. Notwithstanding that, we considered the ad contained claims that were promotional in nature. It stated “All UK Discord Users will enjoy 5% off on everything. Code: DISCORD5”, and the claim “5% OFF” also featured prominently in the accompanying image. We considered the discount was presented as an incentive to purchase Elf Bar products, and that the post suggested there was an element of exclusivity to being a Discord user or having seen the discount on Discord. We therefore considered that the claims in the ad went beyond factual descriptions of Elf Bar’s products. The advertised discount applied to all products on the Elf Bar UK website, the Official Elf Bar Online Vape Store, and we understood that a range of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components were available on that site. We therefore considered the ad had the direct effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarette products which were not licensed as medicines. Because promotional claims for nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were not permitted in online media, we concluded the ad breached the Code. We welcomed Elf Bar’s assurance that they had removed the ad. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 22.12 (Electronic cigarettes).","The ad must not appear again in the form challenged. We told Imiracle (HK) Ltd t/a Elf Bar that marketing communications with either the direct or indirect effect of promoting nicotine-containing e-cigarettes and their components, which were not licensed as medicines, must not appear in prohibited media.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/imiracle--hk--ltd-a23-1196835-imiracle--hk--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Nexusbird Inc t/a Motion,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad for Motion, an AI-controlled calendar, seen on 11 May 2023. The caption stated, “There’s a new way to get 25% more done”. The ad featured a video of a text message exchange between two people. Messages from the first person stated, “My deadlines keep piling up and my ADHD brain doesn’t know what to prioritize” and “I think the boss is starting to notice, HELP!!”. The other person replied, “You should try Motion!” and “It’s the best way to get organized when you have ADHD”. More messages from them stated, “Motion is an AI personal assistant!” and then “The automations that Motion offers are soooooo [sic] helpful”. The first person then responded, “How?! Cause [sic] I keep forgetting my tasks”, “Missing deadlines” and then “And messing with my schedule”. The second person responded “Motion’s AI does it all for YOU” and “It’s the only way I was able to get a promotion!”.",The complainant challenged whether the: 1. medical claims breached the Code; and 2. ad discouraged essential treatment for a condition for which medical supervision should be sought.,"1. & 2. Nexusbird Inc t/a Motion said they were primarily based in the United States, with less than 10% of users of the Motion app coming from the UK. Whilst their ads sometimes appeared outside of the USA, they did not target a particular country. They said Motion was a generic productivity software that enabled users to manage their tasks, calendar and projects, and that it was not designed to treat any medical conditions. They said the majority of their ads showed people using the product and explaining how it helped with their productivity. They explained, for ads that mentioned ADHD, the condition was only highlighted because of the impact the app had on the productivity of users who had the condition. They did not believe the ad claimed to diagnose, treat or cure or prevent ADHD, or that Motion should be used as a replacement of treatment for the condition. They also stated their ads did not suggest it should be used in conjunction with medical treatment for ADHD. However, they said the ad had been removed and similar ads would not be published in future.","1. Upheld The Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) required that a medical device was registered with them before it was placed on the market in Great Britain. The ASA understood that the product was not registered with the MHRA as a medical device. The CAP Code stated medicinal or medical claims and indications were made only for a medicinal product that was licensed by the MHRA, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. The ad stated “my deadlines keep piling up and my ADHD brain doesn’t know what to prioritize [sic]”. In response, the message in the ad stated that Motion was “the best way to get organized [sic] when you have ADHD” and “the automations that Motion offers are soooooo [sic] helpful”. The ad also showed that the person with ADHD was forgetting tasks, missing deadlines and struggling to keep on top of their schedule, to which the message responded “Motion’s AI does it all for YOU”. The ASA acknowledged Motion’s intention to highlight the ways in which the product could help people, including those with ADHD, increase their productivity and that they did not believe they had made any medical claims in the ad. However, we considered the statements implied that Motion could help individuals with ADHD to manage and reduce certain symptoms of the condition and increase their productivity, and thereby help to treat the condition. The ad also implied that using the Motion app would enable individuals who were struggling at work because of their ADHD to get a promotion. Similarly, we considered that suggested the product could help alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and, therefore help to treat the condition. We therefore considered those statements were medical claims which therefore required that the product met the requirements for medical devices. However, as above, because we understood the product was not registered with the MHRA, nor had we seen any evidence that the Motion app had the applicable conformity marking, we therefore considered that no medical claims could be made for the product. Therefore, because the ad made medical claims, we concluded it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.10 (Legality) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). 2. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketers must not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical conditions should be sought. Advertisers must not offer specific advice on diagnosis of or treatment for such conditions, unless that advice, diagnosis or treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. As discussed above, we considered the ad suggested those with ADHD could use the Motion app to alleviate certain symptoms of the condition. We considered that ADHD was a condition for which medical supervision should be sought, and therefore advice, diagnosis or treatment should be conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. However, we did not receive evidence to show that treatment for those with ADHD using the Motion app was carried out under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. We considered that, in the absence of such a professional, the ad discouraged consumers from seeking essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought, and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.2 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Nexusbird Inc t/a Motion not to make medical claims for products that did not have the applicable conformity marking and were not registered with the MHRA. We also told them not to make claims that discouraged the essential treatment for a condition for which medical supervision should be sought.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/nexusbird-inc-a23-1197735-nexusbird-inc.html
ASA Ruling on Nissan Motor (GB) Ltd t/a Nissan Motor (GB) Ltd,,"Two TV ads for Nissan’s Qashqai model: a. The first TV ad, seen in May and September 2023, featured stylised footage of a car driving through a city at night. In its opening shot, an electrical transmission tower threw off sparks as the car drove past it, while the voice-over stated, “Who said electrification can’t spark excitement when unplugged?”. On-screen text stated “FUELLED BY PETROL DRIVEN BY ELECTRIC” while a spark trailed the car through the streets. Along the way, the spark traversed electric vehicle charging cables while further on-screen text stated, “NO NEED TO PLUG IN”. As the voice-over said, “New Nissan Qashqai with e-POWER. A unique electrified experience, unplugged”, the spark leapt onto the “e-POWER” logo embossed on the side of the car, before tunnelling into the car’s motor through a stylised vortex. A close-up shot depicted the vehicle’s display screen featuring the text “Energy Flow”. The ad’s closing shots featured on-screen text that stated “New Nissan Qashqai with e-POWER, unplugged” and the Nissan logo. The ad’s opening shots were accompanied by small on-screen text that stated “*e-POWER comprises a 100% electric motor-driven system, powered by a lithium ion battery and a petrol engine”. b. The second TV ad, seen on 27 June 2023, featured a voice-over, visuals and on-screen text that were similar to those in ad (a). Ad (b) included an additional closing shot whose visuals depicted The Flash, a DC superhero, running around two Nissan cars and leaving a trail of sparks in his wake. The accompanying voice-over stated, “Nissan Qashqai and X-Trail with e-Power. Get your own electrical superpower like The Flash”.",Four complainants challenged whether ads (a) and (b) made the nature of the vehicle’s power source sufficiently clear.,"Nissan Motor (GB) Ltd said that the ads made the nature of the vehicle's power source clear. There was nothing in the ads to suggest it was a new type of 100% electric vehicle that did not need charging. They did not make any references to the car being fully electric, but instead made clear that it was part of their “e-Power” range. This was a unique system that was neither hybrid nor fully electric, but rather used a petrol engine and lithium-ion battery to power an electric motor which solely turned the wheels. This was different from conventional hybrids where the wheels were powered by a petrol engine, electric motor, or a combination of both. The driving experience between an “e-Power” car and a hybrid car was different; unlike driving a hybrid, which switched between power sources, the “e-Power” system did not do this and so was smooth throughout. They did not believe that their technology should be described as “hybrid”. They had always been fully transparent about the “e-Power” technology and were mindful that it was a new technology that consumers needed to understand. The ads included on-screen text which stated “FUELLED BY PETROL DRIVEN BY ELECTRIC” and “NO NEED TO PLUG IN”, as well as the qualifier “e-POWER comprises a 100% electric motor-driven system, powered by a lithium ion battery and a petrol engine”. These all appeared on screen for longer than the legally stipulated time for a consumer to read. These made clear that petrol was required for the vehicle to function, and there was no need to charge it, making it clear that the vehicle was not a 100% electric vehicle that needed charging. Given that they set out clearly that the car needed petrol, to fuel an electric motor that powered the wheels of the vehicle all of the time, they strongly believed that they had not been misleading in explaining “e-Power” technology and all that information was added to help consumers to understand it. The tagline “electrification sparking excitement” was used in reference to their entire range of electricity-based models, which also included fully electric cars, hybrids and mild hybrids. The close-up shot in each ad of the advertised cars’ display screen, which included the text “Energy Flow”, accurately depicted a feature of the car that showed the electric flow to the wheels. As the ads clearly stated “FUELLED BY PETROL” and there were no references to the vehicle being solely powered by electricity, and there were no claims as to fewer emissions, they did not consider that consumers would believe that the car had fewer emissions. Neither ad featured environmental claims and therefore they did not consider that the BCAP Code Rules on environmental claims were relevant. They said the ads were no longer being broadcast in the form complained of, and that in future they would include additional wording to clarify that the vehicle was not a fully electric vehicle and required petrol to fuel the electric motor. Clearcast believed the ad made clear how the car was powered and that it was not misleading. Although the ad referred to “electric” and “charging”, they believed it was acceptable to include these in an ad for a hybrid car because not needing to charge the advertised car was a legitimate point of difference between it and a fully electric car. Nonetheless, they recognised that they needed to make it clear in the advert that the advertised car was not solely powered by an electric battery to avoid confusion. They endorsed the advertisers’ comments that the drive system was unique, and that the on-screen text and qualifier gave a clear description of how the car was powered and made it clear that it was not solely powered by electricity. They also endorsed the advertisers’ comments about there being nothing in the ads about emissions. The avoidance of such claims, coupled with the references to the car having a petrol engine and being powered by petrol, made it clear the car was not emission free.","Upheld Ads (a) and (b) showed a Nissan Qashqai being driven around a city whilst a spark of electricity simultaneously traversed the city, including along electric vehicle charging cables that were plugged in to other cars, until it ultimately leapt onto the Nissan Qashqai’s “e-Power” badge. The ads featured a voice-over that stated, “Who said electrification can’t spark excitement when unplugged? New Nissan Qashqai with e-Power. A unique electrified experience unplugged”. The ads included on-screen text that stated “FUELLED BY PETROL DRIVEN BY ELECTRIC”, “NO NEED TO PLUG IN” and “New Nissan Qashqui with e-POWER A unique electrified experience, unplugged”. Ad (b) also included on-screen text and voice-over that stated “Nissan Qashqai and X-Trail with e-Power. Get your own electrified superpower”. The ads therefore placed strong emphasis on electricity as a means of power. We considered that viewers would understand the ads to mean that the advertised car used “e-Power”, a new, electric technology that did not require the car to be plugged in in the same way as electric powered vehicles. We understood that the “e-Power” technology used an electric motor to drive the cars’ wheels, but that the electric motor was powered either directly by petrol, or from a battery that was recharged by petrol. Additionally, the car had a regenerative braking system that recharged the battery. Therefore, whilst the car only drove using an electric motor, it nonetheless required petrol. As referenced above, the ad stated “FUELLED BY PETROL DRIVEN BY ELECTRIC”. It also included qualifying text that stated “*e-POWER comprises a 100% electric motor-driven system, powered by a lithium ion battery and a petrol engine”. We considered that whilst viewers may have understood from those claims that the car required petrol, because they were alongside claims about the car being driven by electric and the ad as a whole strongly emphasised the role of electricity in the car, the extent of the role petrol had in powering the car was unclear. Further, because “e-Power” was a unique and new technology, most consumers would not be aware of how it differed from other forms of hybrid technology. We therefore considered that the ads did not make the nature of the vehicle’s power source sufficiently clear. Furthermore, whilst the ad did not include any explicit claims in relation to the car’s environmental impact, we considered that by focusing on the car’s use of electricity, consumers were likely to understand that the car was a better choice for the environment than traditionally fuelled vehicles. However, because the ads did not make sufficiently clear the nature of the vehicle’s power source and because it required petrol to power the electric motor, which would produce tailpipe emissions, we considered that the ads were also misleading in this regard. We concluded that the ads did not make sufficiently clear the extent to which the car required petrol and were therefore misleading. Ads (a) and (b) breached BCAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 9.2 and 9.3 (Environmental claims).",The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Nissan Motor (GB) Ltd to ensure that their future ads made sufficiently clear the nature of a vehicle’s power source.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/nissan-motor--gb--ltd-g23-1206694-nissan-motor--gb--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Repsol SA,,"A paid-for online display ad for Repsol, a global energy company, seen on the Financial Times website on 12 July 2023, featured an image of a water droplet with text that stated “Renewable hydrogen, another alternative to reduce emissions. At Repsol, we are committed to renewable hydrogen as an energy source that offers up different uses such as zero net emissions synthetic fuel production”. The ad also featured a series of graphics: the text “H2” encircled by two arrows; a solar panel with a sun; a car with a stylised letter “e” that had a plug at the end; a wind turbine; two arrows that formed a circle; a sapling; and a petrol pump with a leaf on it.",Adfree Cities challenged whether the ad was misleading because it omitted significant information about the overall environmental impact of Repsol’s business activities.,"Repsol SA said they were committed to reducing emissions from operated assets and net emissions by 55% and 30% by 2030, respectively. They were also committed to reducing their methane emissions by 85% to 0.2% by 2025. Their investments in low carbon energy made up a third of their total spending, and they aimed to have 45% of their total employed capital invested in the area by 2030. They were in the process of transforming their seven industrial complexes in Spain, Portugal and Peru into multi-energy hubs to aid in the production of renewable hydrogen by 2030. Energy consumption at those complexes had fallen by 20% between 2011 and 2022, equivalent to three metric tonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide (CO2). They also aimed to achieve net zero emissions across their business by 2050. They highlighted that extensive development and upscaling of new technology, such as renewable hydrogen, was needed before it existed in a commercial form. As such, the transition to renewable energy that used new or emerging technology could not always be expressed in ads in terms of existing production. Repsol said they were the largest operator in the Spanish electric vehicle (EV) charging network. They also developed and sold liquid fuels, gasoline and diesel, renewable biofuels, and natural gas for vehicles. They produced an average of 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which nearly 70% was gas. Their hydrocarbons production was focused on gas since that fuel helped electricity production in the transition from higher-emitting fuels such as coal. They also produced oil and petrochemical products such as plastics. Lighter, stronger plastics played an important part in manufacturing EVs since the batteries for those vehicles increased their overall weight. They envisaged that renewable hydrogen would be an effective way of producing and decarbonising fuels used in transport, such as gasoline and diesel. They highlighted that the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that oil would still be needed in a decarbonised world. Repsol said that renewable hydrogen was one of the main alternative fuels needed for synthetic fuel production to foster a transition away from fossil fuels, which in turn would help to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Renewable hydrogen was a nascent industry of key importance to Europe, the UK and the US that required a large amount of investment. They explained that Repsol was a Spanish company with no relevant presence for consumers in the UK market. The ad had therefore been targeted at potential investors in the energy sector rather than the general public, and was aimed at increasing visibility of renewable hydrogen, and highlighting Repsol’s commitment to renewable hydrogen, rather than selling a specific product. The icons used in the ad displayed other alternative sources of energy, complementing the ad’s principal message. Additionally, the ad had been designed for inclusion in the Financial Times’ (FT) digital energy newsletter, sponsored by Repsol, which was aimed at an informed audience of users who subscribed to it specifically for energy sector-related news. Repsol said the format and medium of the ad, which was constrained by time and space, meant they had been unable to add more information about their general business activities. Clicking the ad took consumers to Repsol’s corporate website where they could find more information about those activities, and their environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting; the latter of which included information about their annual emissions and plans to reduce them. They said there was no obligation on them to describe the totality of their business activities in an ad and that the ad could not have misled consumers or investors into making a transactional decision that they would not have taken otherwise.","Upheld The CAP Code stated that unqualified environmental claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. The complainant had seen the ad on the FT website, and the ASA understood it had also appeared in the FT digital energy newsletter. It would therefore have been of interest to investors and those interested in purchasing Repsol’s products. We considered both audiences would have an awareness that many companies in carbon-intensive industries, including the oil and gas sector, were in the process of developing renewable alternatives to fossil fuels to help consumers dramatically reduce their emissions in response to the climate crisis. In addition, both groups were increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon products. They would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, who were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services, including those developing alternative, synthetic fuels such as renewable hydrogen. However, we considered that consumers and many business readers were unlikely to be aware of the specific details of such technology – for example, that the development of renewable hydrogen was in its infancy and was not yet commercially available. The ad included several icons, including solar panels, an electric vehicle, a wind turbine, and a petrol pump with a leaf on it, which we considered would be understood by consumers as references to lower carbon energy sources. We considered both consumers and business readers were likely to understand the claim “Renewable hydrogen, another alternative to reduce emissions […] At Repsol, we are committed to renewable hydrogen as an energy source that offers up different uses such as zero net emissions synthetic fuel production” to mean that renewable hydrogen was an alternative to fossil fuels whose production and use could help to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and that lower carbon energy – of which renewable hydrogen was one such example – formed a significant proportion of Repsol’s overall energy production that was aimed at helping to achieve net zero emissions. We considered the icons depicting examples of other lower carbon energy sources strengthened that impression. We further considered that, in the absence of qualifying information, the cumulative effect of the claim relating to renewable hydrogen, in combination with the icons displayed in the ad, gave the impression that renewable energy products comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Repsol developed and sold, or were likely to develop or sell in the near future. We understood Repsol were in the process of transforming several of their industrial complexes to aid in the production of renewable hydrogen by 2030, and that extensive development and upscaling of the technology was needed before it existed in a commercial form. However, we also understood Repsol’s operations in the area would not commence until 2024, and that their development and production of renewable hydrogen was not yet in operation. We understood Repsol’s carbon emissions stood at 171 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2021 (50% of the emissions of the UK in 2021, 346.7 Mt CO2e), and they produced approximately 600,000 barrels of oil per day. They also had a substantial oil and gas exploration strategy, owning an interest in 40,660 acres (gross) of oil and gas development and exploration across Europe, Latin America, North America, Africa, and Asia and Oceania. We therefore understood that large-scale global oil and gas investment and exploration formed the vast majority of Repsol’s business interests. We considered the ad gave the overall impression that a significant proportion of Repsol’s business comprised lower carbon energy, such as renewable hydrogen, and therefore further information about the proportion of Repsol’s overall business model that comprised lower carbon energy was material information that should have been included. Because the ad did not include that information, we concluded it omitted material information and was likely to mislead. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1, 3.3 (Misleading Advertising), and 11.1 (Environmental Claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Repsol SA to ensure that their future ads featuring environmental claims did not mislead by omitting significant information about the proportion of their business activities that were comprised of renewable energy, or the role renewable energy and renewable hydrogen played in their business activities.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/repsol-sa-a23-1206254-repsol-sa.html
"ASA Ruling on Shop TJC Ltd t/a TJC, The Jewellery Channel Ltd",,"A teleshopping presentation for the Opatra Pro Light Machine, seen on 1 May 2023 on 5USA, featured a TJC presenter who demonstrated the product and an Optra brand ambassador. During the presentation a number of claims were made regarding the device’s capacity to treat medical conditions including osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis as well as skin inflammation, rosacea and melasma that included “it helps inflammation, things like tennis elbow, Carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis” and “customers out there who may be suffering with osteoarthritis or osteoporosis […] it can help actually to strengthen your bones”.",The complainant challenged whether the medical claims breached the Code.,"Shop TJC Ltd said they were investigating whether the claims had been taken from information provided by the product manufacturer and had suspended promotion of the product. They stated they would not repeat the claims in any future presentations of the product, and had spoken to the presenter and the product manufacturer about the complaint. They said they would be commencing a training programme for their staff in relation to their responsibilities under the BCAP Code, as well as reminding product suppliers of their responsibilities in relation to compliance and the accuracy of product claims.","Upheld The Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) required that a medical device was registered with them before it was placed on the market in Great Britain. The ASA understood that the product was not registered with the MHRA as a medical device. The BCAP Code stated that teleshopping presentations for medical treatments for humans or animals were not acceptable. We considered that within the context of the ad as a whole, viewers were likely to understand the claims that were made throughout the presentation to mean that the product could be used to treat and alleviate various medical conditions in humans. Those claims included, but were not limited to, “it helps inflammation, things like tennis elbow, Carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis” and “customers out there who may be suffering with osteoarthritis or osteoporosis […] it can help actually to strengthen your bones”. We therefore considered the ad breached the Code on that basis. In addition, the Code required that medicinal or medical claims and indications were made only for a medicinal product that was licensed by the MHRA, the VMD or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or for a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. We considered the claims set out above were medical claims which therefore required that the product met the requirements for medical devices. However, as above, we understood the product was not registered with the MHRA, nor have we seen any evidence to demonstrate the product was a medical device with the applicable conformity marking. Notwithstanding that the ad breached the Code by being a teleshopping presentation for medical treatments for humans, we therefore considered no medical claims could be made for the product, and the ad also breached the Code on that basis. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 1.3 (Compliance), and 11.4 and 11.12.3 (Medical devices).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Shop TJC Ltd to ensure teleshopping ads did not promote products or services that were medical treatments for humans, and not to make medical claims for products that did not have the applicable conformity marking and were not licensed by the MHRA.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/shop-tjc-ltd-a23-1196566-shop-tjc-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on ThruDark Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An Instagram post from clothing retailer ThruDark, posted 18 July 2023, featured a video that began with a human-shaped figure wearing a hooded pink coat, seen at a distance standing against one of three wooden frames in front of an earth bank in a field. A person wearing a black hooded coat stepped into view close to the camera, pulled out a semi-automatic rifle and began shooting at the pink-coated figure. Slow motion close-ups showed bullet holes appearing in the coat. The black-hooded individual walked whilst firing, towards the pink-coated figure, changing magazines before pulling out a pistol and continuing to fire. A close-up of the pink-coated figure revealed that it was a mannequin. Further shots destroyed the mannequin’s head while a short scream was heard. The black-hooded individual walked away, towards a building with a corrugated iron roof, showing the ThruDark logo on the back of the coat. They then turned back, pulled out a shotgun that was hidden under the coat and began firing again. Large holes appeared in the mannequin’s head and torso and its head fell off. The black-hooded individual finally walked away and the video cut to a black screen with the text “There can be only one”, followed by ThruDark’s logo. Throughout the ad, classical music was played in the background. The video’s caption stated “‘There can be only one.’ #shroud #thrudark #endeavourthroughadversity”.","The ASA received 11 complaints. 1. The complainants, who believed the ad implied the pink-coated figure was female and the black-coated figured was male, challenged whether the ad was irresponsible, offensive and condoned and encouraged violence, particularly against women. 2. Some of the complainants challenged whether the ad was also irresponsible because it glamourised guns and gun violence.","1. & 2. ThruDark Ltd said they had a proud military heritage and had shown weaponry in previous brand communications and content as a reference to their background. They had established themselves as a brand that was known for their tongue-in-cheek humour and disruptive messaging. They said the ad’s scenario was filmed in good humour and had comedic intention. They had used classical music by Chopin in the background, which they specifically chose to soften and mock the crude nature of the scenario. Additionally, they had used the “Wilhelm scream” stock sound, an inside joke among sound designers, for slapstick comedic effect. They considered that the “Wilhelm scream” was particularly illustrative of the humorous nature of the ad. Some aspects were filmed in slow motion to lessen the sense of realism and heighten the slapstick tone, which was intended to parody the glamorisation of violence frequently shown on television. They considered it was clear from the beginning of the ad that the pink-coated figure was a mannequin. They said it was male in form and did not have feminine facial features, as shown in a “behind the scenes” video shared by a co-founder. They considered that if viewers believed the mannequin was female because it was wearing a pink changing robe, that belief was rooted in the viewer’s own prejudices. They said they had taken positions against the “shrink it and pink it” culture shown by other brands and pointed to previous posts in which they questioned why womenswear was equated with the colour pink. They had used the colour pink because that was the most radical visual departure from their signature black branding and it was the first, brightest-coloured robe they had to hand. They had consistently spoken out against brightly coloured clothing given their background in night operations as part of elite military units. They also did not consider that the black robe would be assumed to indicate the male gender. In the context of the music, comedy sound effects and slow motion, the contrast in the colour of the robes portrayed a fantastical battle between light and dark. The slogan “There can only be one” was a clear reference to the changing robe comparison. It also referenced the cult 1980s fantasy film Highlander, reinforcing the sense of fantastical battle. On the use of guns during the ad, they stated that the simple presence of a gun was not, in and of itself, evidence of a particular stance on gun usage. They said ads for violent action films, children’s toy guns and clay pigeon shooting were permissible on social media platforms. They considered the presence of weapons in the ad was in keeping with their brand’s military heritage and identity. They said that the ad was not irresponsible, because the actions took place in a secure firing range by a highly trained former UK Special Forces operator, and the use of an inanimate object minimised any potential risk of harm. They considered that it was clear that the location was a firing range and not a field because of the target stations, sand bank and covered firing positions. They also said that public disclaimers were messaged at the time. They believed it was not relevant that the firearms used were semi-automatic, but highlighted that the use of semi-automatic weapons would typically be considered to be less extreme than the use of automatic weapons.The ad did not include any form of encouragement or incitement of violence against minority groups, or anti-social behaviour. The ad was in line with their military heritage and was overall well received by the 350,000 people who had viewed it. In their view, the 11 complaints reflected the internalised biases of the complainants and did not evidence that the ad caused serious or widespread offence or was irresponsible. Meta said that they investigated the matter and had restricted the ad from appearing in the United Kingdom.","1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. It further stated that marketing communications must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence and that particular care must be taken to avoid causing offence on the grounds of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability or age. The ad depicted a black-hooded figure repeatedly shooting at a figure wearing a pink coat. The ASA noted that the distinctive colouring of its coat was particularly prominent against the otherwise gloomy colour-scheme. While we agreed that colours were not inherently gendered, we considered that pink was culturally associated with femininity in the UK. In that context, we considered that the simplistic imagery of the stark contrast between the black and pink figures visually alluded to the figures being, respectively, male and female. A close-up of the mannequin’s delicate facial features, which when surrounded by the pink hood we considered would be read as feminine, further enhanced this contrast with the black-hooded figure. We considered that viewers would interpret the ad as alluding to a man shooting and killing a woman or as practising and preparing for a similar scenario. We considered that the ad glamorised and condoned that scenario and was unlikely to be understood as a parody. Rather than suggesting a comedic tone, we considered the use of gentle classical music, with slow-motion emphasis on the damage inflicted on the mannequin, added an eerie tone to the ad. We also considered only a small proportion of the ad’s audience were likely to recognise the “Wilhem scream” and be aware of its background. We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious and widespread offence, that it condoned and encouraged violence against women, and was irresponsible. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.4 (Harm and offence). 2. Upheld We understood the ad was intended to promote the changing robe worn by the black-hooded figure. We further understood that ThruDark had a military legacy as its founders had previously served in the UK Special Forces. While the ad was set in an outdoor environment and the brand was focused on outdoor clothing, we understood that the guns shown in the ad were not equipment which would typically be used for sport or legal hunting in the UK. We therefore considered that, in the context of an ad from a clothing retailer for outerwear, the presence of three semi-automatic firearms was incongruous and jarring. Throughout the ad, the black-hooded figure repeatedly fired at the mannequin using a semi-automatic rifle, pistol and shotgun, until its head fell off. We considered that the particular weapons used, and the relentless shooting at the target, displayed an extreme level of violence which, as referenced above, would not be interpreted as a comedic parody. Although we accepted that the inclusion of a gun in an ad would not always be irresponsible, we considered that the use of multiple guns (and the particular weapons used), in an ad which promoted an item of outerwear, together with the focus on the guns’ destructive capacity and the added emphasis of the slow-motion effect, glamorised guns and gun violence. We therefore concluded that the ad irresponsibly glamorised guns and condoned gun violence and was in breach of the Code. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.4 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told ThruDark Ltd to ensure that their ads were socially responsible, did not cause serious or widespread offence, and did not condone and encourage violence, particularly against women. We also told them not to glamorise guns and gun violence in their advertising.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/thrudark-ltd-g23-1206049-thrudark-ltd.html
