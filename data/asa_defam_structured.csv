ASA Ruling on air up GmbH,,"A paid-for TikTok ad for air up, a water bottle company, seen on 13 February 2025, featured a man lying on a road marking of a bicycle and pretending to pedal. A voiceover said, “What the fuck, are you high? Get hydrated.” On-screen text stated, “What the f#%l? Are you hy?”. A caption stated, “Ready to Get Hy?”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad was offensive.,"air up GmbH said that the phrase “Are you high” was not a reference to the use of drugs. They said that the phrase was a colloquial reference to someone acting strangely or ‘out of their mind’. They said that the use of the word “fuck” was not offensive in the context of the ad and was used as a colloquial expression of surprise and frustration. On both of those points, air up provided various examples which they believed demonstrated the colloquial meaning of those phrases.air up said that the ad was no longer running.","The CAP Code stated that ads must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. The ad was a TikTok video which featured a man pretending to pedal whilst lying on top of a road marking of a bicycle. The voiceover stated, “What the fuck? Are you high?” and on-screen text stated, “What the f#%I? Are you Hy?”. We understood that the ad was targeted to a general adult audience. We considered that consumers would understand the phrase “are you high”, in combination with the imagery used, to imply that the man was behaving out of character due to being under the influence of recreational drugs. We understood that while the use of “high” was a play on the word “hydrated”, the use of drugs was not relevant to the product. We considered that, by presenting the effects of drugs as a subject of humour and including the caption “Ready to get Hy”, the reference trivialised recreational drug use by humourising the serious psychological effects it could have on an individual. Although we acknowledged that the word “fuck” had numerous connotations, consumer research by the ASA and other bodies showed that the use of words such as “fuck” were likely to offend to such an extent that they should not be used at all in marketing communications even if they were relevant to the product, unless very carefully targeted to an audience that was unlikely to be offended by them. We understood that was not the case for this ad. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad was irresponsible and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. The ad breached CAP (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social Responsibility) and 4.1 (Harm and Offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told air up GmbH to ensure their ads were prepared responsibly and did not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence by, for example, avoiding expletives and claims which trivialised recreational drug use.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/air-up-gmbh-a25-1281155-air-up-gmbh.html
ASA Ruling on GreenPixel Ltd t/a Hotel Merge Empire,,"An in-game ad for the mobile game Hotel Merge Empire, seen in the Block Puzzle mobile app on 19 February, showed a woman holding a baby while standing on a porch. She was surrounded by a man, a younger woman and an older woman. The man pointed to her and said “NOW”, while the younger woman pushed her down the stairs. The older woman then forcibly took the baby from the woman’s arms, as she was shown saying “NO!”. The woman walked back up to the porch and was then kicked back down the stairs again by the man.","The complainant, who believed that the ad trivialised and condoned domestic violence, challenged whether the ad was offensive and irresponsible.","GreenPixel Ltd t/a Hotel Merge Empire said that they did not intend to cause offence and took their responsibility to adhere to the CAP Code seriously. The ad was part of a test campaign, which they said was shown to only a small number of users. However, they understood the importance of compliance, regardless of scale. They said that they placed age-targeting measures in all their ad campaigns to ensure that their content was only viewed by mature audiences. The animated, cartoonish style of the ad was consistent with the visual identity of their game. They believed that style was integral to their brand, and its use in the ad was intended to ensure visual design consistency, rather than to trivialise serious issues. They said the storyline shown in the ad did not depict domestic violence because the woman shown in the storyline was not the child’s mother or a member of the family. Instead, the woman was portrayed as the child’s nanny, who had failed to meet the expected standards of care for her role. The father’s aggression was driven by his fear that she might attempt to take the child and reflected an exaggerated response in the context of the narrative. They highlighted that the story concluded with the child returning unharmed to a loving family, which they believed reinforced that lasting harm did not occur. They confirmed that the ad had been withdrawn, and that it, along with similar creatives, would not be used in future. Big Cake Group Ltd, the creator of the Block Puzzle game in which ad had appeared, said that they were unable to identify which network served the ad. This was because they worked with several ad networks who sold their inventory using a bidding model. They did however provide a list of all of the ad networks that they used.","The CAP Code required marketers to avoid causing serious or widespread offence and to ensure advertising was prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. It further stated that marketing communications must contain nothing that was likely to condone or encourage violence. The ad showed a woman being pushed down the stairs, outside a home, by another woman, while holding a baby. After being pushed, the woman was then shown having the baby forcibly taken from her and appeared visibly distressed as she shouted “NO”. In her attempt to take the baby back, she was kicked down the stairs for a second time by a man, who was depicted in an angry and aggressive manner. We considered that consumers would understand that the woman and baby had been physically assaulted. We considered there was nothing in the ad to indicate that the woman was the baby’s nanny, and we further considered consumers would likely assume that the woman was the baby’s mother, because of her visible distress after the baby was taken from her care. On that basis, we considered that some consumers would understand that the woman was, or had previously been in, a relationship with the male character. Irrespective of the nature of the relationships between the characters, we considered the violence depicted in the ad was unacceptable. Furthermore, the ad featured bright colours and a cartoonish animation style which we considered gave the ad a playful and light-hearted tone. We considered that the ad appeared to present portrayals of assault with the purpose of entertaining viewers and made light of violence. We considered that the ad, in portraying assault in that way, had the effect of condoning violence, including domestic violence, and furthermore, was irresponsible and likely to cause serious and widespread offence, particularly in the context of an ad for a mobile app game. On that basis, we concluded that the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.4 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told GreenPixel Ltd t/a Hotel Merge Empire to ensure that their ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious or widespread offence, including by trivialising, condoning or encouraging domestic violence.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/greenpixel-ltd-a25-1279874-greenpixel-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Cloud Whale Interactive Technology,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An in-game ad for the mobile app PolyBuzz, an AI chat platform, seen on 10 February 2025 in the app game ‘Room Sort’ featured an animated image of a woman who had her mouth open. The image was partially obscured by overlaid text that stated, “Me after finding a cai alternative with No Filters!!”. It also featured a text-message exchange in which one party asked, “so do you want me to kiss you”, “or do you want me to f**k you”, “you know what I want to hear from you”, “say something” [sic]. The other party replied, “Please taste me”.","The complainant, who understood that the 'Room Sort' game was classified as being suitable for all ages, challenged whether the ad:","Cloud Whale Interactive Technology did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. Gamincat Inc, the developer of the game in which the ad was seen, said that they had implemented restrictions on adult-related ads through ad network filters but somehow this ad had been displayed. They had therefore asked ad network companies to block the advertiser, so that it would not appear again. Gamincat Inc also told us that they had not received any direct complaints about the ad.","The ASA was concerned by Cloud Whale Interactive Technology’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code required marketers to avoid causing serious or widespread offence and to ensure advertising was prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. The ad depicted a text exchange between two characters which was of a sexual nature. It featured the text “Me after finding a cai alternative with No Filters!!” which we considered users of the app would be likely to understand to mean an AI-generated character which had no filters or restrictions on what it could say. It included the text “do you want me to f**k you” [sic]. We considered that those who saw the ad would understand that it implied the word ‘fuck’ and the question was therefore pertaining to sexual intercourse. We considered ‘fuck’ a word so likely to offend that it should not generally be used or alluded to in advertising. The ad also featured the text “Please taste me” which we considered, in that context, some users of the app were likely to understand as being sexual innuendo alluding to engaging in oral sex. The ad had appeared in the game 'Room Sort'. 'Room Sort' was rated as suitable for those aged 12 years and older which meant it could be downloaded by children. The advertiser provided no information about how they targeted their advertising, or if they used interest-based criteria to do so. Because the ad contained extremely offensive language which was also pertaining to sexual intercourse in a medium that would have had broad appeal, including to children, as well as other sexual references, we considered it was likely to cause serious and widespread offence, and had been targeted irresponsibly. We therefore concluded that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.1 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Cloud Whale Interactive Technology to ensure that future ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious or widespread offence, including by avoiding references to expletives or sexual references unless in a suitably targeted medium. We also told them to ensure that their ads were responsibly targeted. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/cloud-whale-interactive-technology-a25-1278753-cloud-whale-interactive-technology.html
ASA Ruling on Whaleco UK Ltd t/a Temu,,"An in-game ad for Temu seen on 11 February 2025 in the app Spider Solitaire Fun. The ad included a picture of a greetings card, on which text stated, “I’VE MET SOME CUNTS IN MY TIME, BUT YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE THE CUNTIEST HAPPY BIRTHDAY”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread offence.,"Whaleco UK Ltd t/a Temu stated that the ad did not reflect their usual standards of practice and was the result of an isolated incident caused by a temporary glitch in their screening process during a system upgrade for enhancing the screening process. They said that the word “cunt” was already on their blocklist and would normally have been blocked automatically. However, the upgrade caused the product image (a birthday card) to bypass normal checks. They had since run a full system search to ensure no blocklisted terms were being used across other advertising channels. They stated that the ad was served via Meta Audience Network and was chosen by Meta’s algorithm, rather than by Temu directly. They said the ad had been removed proactively before they were contacted by the ASA. Temu emphasised their ongoing collaboration with the ASA and commitment to UK advertising compliance, including implementing more robust processes to avoid similar issues in future.","The CAP Code required marketers to avoid causing serious or widespread offence. The ad, for a birthday card, included the swear word “CUNTS” and “CUNTIEST” and appeared in a solitaire game app rated as being suitable for those aged four years and older. Consumer research by the ASA showed that use of words such as “CUNT” was so likely to offend that they should not be used at all in marketing communications. That was the case even if they were relevant to the product, unless very carefully targeted to an audience that was unlikely to be offended by them. We acknowledged Temu’s commitment to collaborate with the ASA and their proactive removal of the ad, which appeared in error. However, we considered that “CUNT” was a particularly offensive swear word. We therefore concluded that its appearance in the untargeted medium of the solitaire game app was likely to cause both serious and widespread offence. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 4.1 (Harm and Offence).","The ad should not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Belle Baby Ltd,"Update to Advertising Codes (7 April 2025): On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ad and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code .","A website for Belle Baby, www.bellebaby.co.uk, a retailer of baby products seen on 22 December 2024, listed a “Cupcake Swimsuit” for sale. The ad contained an image of a young girl wearing the swimsuit, popping her hip to one side and looking down at a bow on the side of the swimsuit.",The complainant challenged whether the ad portrayed a child in a sexual way.,Belle Baby Ltd said they had removed the image from their website.,"The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not portray or represent anyone who was, or seemed to be, under 18 years of age in a sexual way. The girl was aged around five or six years. She appeared to be wearing eye shadow, heavy mascara and lipstick and had her long hair styled in curls. She was standing in a pose in which her hip was popped to one side, her back was arched and her eyes were downcast to look at a bow sewn on to the hip of her swimsuit, which she was also holding with one hand. We considered the pose and styling would be typically associated with older models, rather than being the natural posture or pose of a child. Although the swimsuit she was wearing was appropriate and intended for a child of her age, and the ASA acknowledged that young children typically enjoyed dressing up and looking older, we nevertheless considered that the combination of her styled hair and heavy make-up, her downward and submissive-looking glance and the way her hip was popped to one side had the effect of portraying her in a sexual way. We therefore concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 4.8 (Harm and offence).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We welcomed Belle Baby Ltd’s decision to withdraw the ad. We told them to ensure their future ads did not include images that portrayed anyone under 18 in a sexual way.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/belle-baby-ltd-a25-1273764-belle-baby-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Wahed Invest Ltd,,"Six posters for Wahed Invest Ltd, an online Halal investment platform, seen in September and October 2024 on various Transport for London (TfL) services, including London Underground tubes and buses: a. The first poster featured images of two men pointing upwards with their index fingers, and US dollar banknotes on fire. Large text stated, “Join the Money Revolution” above the advertiser’s logo. Smaller text stated, “Capital at risk. Wahed Invest Ltd is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority”. b. The second poster featured similar images as seen in ad (a) of two men pointing upwards with their index fingers, and US dollar banknotes on fire. Large text stated, “Join the Money Revolution”. c. The third poster included the same text and small print as ad (a). The image showed a man holding an open briefcase filled with US dollar and Euro banknotes on fire. d. The fourth poster included the same briefcase image as ad (c), and the same small print as the other ads. A large heading stated, “Withdraw from Exploitation”. Text below stated, “Charging people to borrow money was once called exploitation. Sadly, that perception has changed and now interest has caused a massive wealth gap, enriching the few while the majority get poorer. Join the growing community moving their money to a fairer system, one that serves you! Download Wahed now. Join the Money Revolution”. e. The fifth poster included the same briefcase image as ad (c). Large text stated, “Withdraw from Riba”. Smaller text stated, “Join the Money Revolution. Capital at risk”. f. The sixth poster included the same text and small print as ad (a). It featured a similar image seen in ad (a) of one man pointing upwards and US dollar and Euro banknotes on fire.",Seventy-five complainants challenged whether the ads were offensive.,"Wahed Invest Ltd believed that although their ads were thought-provoking, they were not offensive. They explained they were a digital investment platform which allowed consumers who were predominantly Muslim to invest in an ethical manner which aligned with their faith and values. They said a major component of their platform was that it did not charge consumers interest on loans. They explained that their ads often used the term ‘Riba’, which was an Arabic word that meant ‘excess’ and was commonly used to describe the prohibition of interest under Islamic law. Wahed Invest provided links to several articles on their website, as well as external reports, which they believed highlighted the ways in which interest, or Riba, contributed to social and financial inequality. They also believed inflation was not a properly understood concept and provided a survey which supported that view. They believed it was important to educate people to properly understand interest. They believed Muslims who held the belief that interest contributed to financial inequality had limited options for where to store their money and understood that some often requested for financial institutions to not pay them interest. They believed that, due to rising inflation, consumers who followed Islamic law by not accepting interest on savings suffered from further long-term wealth inequality than those who did accept interest. They said their advertising stated, “Interest has caused a massive wealth gap, enriching the few while the majority get poorer”. They said the burning of banknotes within their ads was designed to be a powerful visual illustration that money stored in a way that was growing at a rate lower than inflation created a decrease in value and purchasing power in real terms. The purpose of the ads was therefore to show that, when inflation grew faster than the rate of savings, money was akin to ‘going up in flames’. They believed all viewers, including those who were not Muslim, would have understood that expression. They said the ads had not criticised specific groups and that they used US dollar and Euro banknotes because they were amongst the most recognised currencies in the world. The purpose of the ads was to promote ethical investing as defined by Islamic law. Wahed Invest acknowledged that currencies were a symbol of national identity but believed the burning of banknotes was not offensive and was portrayed in popular culture, like film and TV. They also believed the burning of money was a commonly understood concept. For example, due to hyperinflation, there had been famous examples of people burning money. They said popular phrases such as ‘money to burn’ and ‘burning a hole in my pocket’ were used to describe someone who had money to spend. They also said the phrase ‘burn rate’ was used to describe how quickly a company was spending money. They believed that, had the idea of burning money been a cause for widespread offence, such language or visual representations would not be as commonly used or as easily understood in society as it was. TfL said their advertising partners, which included Global, reviewed all campaigns before they were approved to run on the network. They said in some cases, such as with ads (a)–(f), TfL also reviewed campaigns internally. They believed the ads complied with TfL’s ad policy and the CAP Code. They received some complaints about the ads and had paused all campaigns from Wahed Invest pending the outcome of the investigation. Global said they reviewed the ads internally and submitted them to the CAP Copy Advice team, who considered they were unlikely to raise issues under the CAP Code. They said they had not received any complaints about the ads. The ads were no longer appearing.","The CAP Code stated that ads must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. Particular care must be taken to avoid causing offence on certain grounds, including race (which includes nationality). We acknowledged Wahed Invest’s view that the burning of banknotes illustrated that money which grew at a rate lower than inflation decreased in value in real terms. The ads represented the expression that viewers’ money was ‘going up in flames’ and that images of burning money were commonly encountered. However, regardless of whether viewers would have understood that message or understood it as a defiant act designed to show a challenge to financial institutions, the currencies which were burned in all of the ads were clearly visible as US dollar and Euro banknotes. In the case of the US dollars depicted, in all instances the ads showed the words “The United States of America” in flames. The ads were shown on several sites across the TfL network, including on London Underground tubes, which was an untargeted medium, and they were therefore likely to be seen by many people. It was also a service regularly used by tourists. Due to the vast number of people who used TfL services and because London was a tourist hotspot, people from the United States or Eurozone countries would have seen the ads. We considered some viewers, particularly people from the United States or Eurozone countries, would have viewed their nation’s currency as being culturally significant and a symbol of their national identity. Although we acknowledged Wahed Invest’s view that they had not directly criticised a specific group, and that depictions of burning banknotes were commonly encountered, we considered the burning of banknotes would have caused serious offence to some viewers. We therefore concluded that the ads were likely to cause serious offence. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 4.1 (Harm and offence).","The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of. We told Wahed Invest Ltd to ensure that future ads did not cause serious offence, including by featuring images of burning US dollar or Euro banknotes.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/wahed-invest-ltd-g24-1262171-wahed-invest-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Jaded London Ltd,,"An Instagram post by Jaded London, a clothing retailer, seen on 29 September 2024, featured two images. The first image featured a nude woman wearing a motorbike helmet and boots. She was placed between two motorbike wheels and was holding the front wheel, while her feet were on the back wheel. The second image featured a woman wearing a motorbike helmet, boots and a faux fur coat that was raised to expose her bottom. She was placed between two motorbike wheels and was holding the front wheel, while her feet were on the back wheel. A caption on the post stated “Introducing our newest collaboration with @newrock. 4 styles. Hand crafted in Spain. Launching 3rd October. Stay tuned”.","The complainant, who believed that the images objectified and sexualised women, challenged whether the ad was offensive and promoted a harmful gender stereotype.","Jaded London Ltd believed that the ad did not objectify or sexualise women. They said the purpose of the ad was to celebrate the strength of the female form and had received positive feedback from their customers, who they believed were predominately female. They said they wanted to ensure their customers felt respected.","The CAP Code stated that ads must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, must not cause serious or widespread offence and must not include gender stereotypes that were likely to cause harm. The women were seen holding the front wheels of a motorbike while their legs were on the back wheels, which meant that their bodies and arms were stretched out in a horizontal position. That gave the impression that they formed the main component of a bike. The ASA considered this suggested they should be viewed as parts of machinery and as objects, rather than as people. Both women were wearing motorbike helmets, meaning their faces were not visible. We considered obscuring the women’s faces made their bodies the focus of the ad and further presented them as objects. The women’s bodies were positioned so their buttocks were in the place of the motorbike seat and both women’s legs were bent at the knees. That had the effect of raising their buttocks in a manner which would have been understood as being sexually suggestive, as well as being a central focus of the ad. The woman’s body in the first image was entirely naked, meaning her breasts and buttocks were exposed, which added to that sexual impression. The woman in the second image was wearing a faux fur coat. However, the coat was raised, which exposed both her legs and her buttocks and made them the focus of the image. We acknowledged that the raised coat could have been interpreted as a reference to a motorbike moving at speed as the wind blew the coat upwards. However, we considered exposing her buttocks in that manner gave the image a voyeuristic feel. We considered that by presenting the women as motorbikes, in conjunction with the nudity and sexually suggestive position in which their bodies were posed, the images featured the harmful gender stereotype that women were sexual objects. Although the ad promoted a shoe brand, we considered the women’s bodies were the focus of the images, not the boots, and the nudity was not relevant to the products.For those reasons, we considered that the ad objectified the women depicted and gave the impression that their bodies were sexual objects. We therefore concluded that the ad included a harmful gender stereotype and was likely to cause serious offence. The ad breached CAP (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Jaded London Ltd to ensure that future ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious offence, including by featuring a harmful gender stereotype by objectifying or sexualising women.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/jaded-london-ltd-a24-1262531-jaded-london-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on get_0ut_0f_debt Ltd,,"A TikTok video from the get_0ut_0f_debt TikTok account, seen in September 2024, showed a man standing on a chair in an empty office. He placed a looped length of cord around his neck. The other end of the cord was suspended above his head. Text stated, “Had to sleep here last night because got evicted due to debt, everyone knows I’m not in a good place, can’t take it any more… can you relate?” The scene then cut to colleagues running through the door. The man was lying face down and motionless on the floor with the cord around his neck and the other end of the cord reaching up towards the ceiling. One of the colleagues attempted to rouse the man and dialled 999 on their mobile phone. The man remained lying on the floor as the camera zoomed out. The soundtrack to the video featured the song lyric “One step closer”.","The Insolvency Service challenged whether the ad was irresponsible, distressing and offensive.","get_0ut_0f_debt Ltd t/a get_0ut_0f_debt said the video was an organic post rather than a paid ad. They said they posted regularly on a variety of subjects. Their aim was to highlight mental health issues and their causes. They said on reflection they could appreciate why the post, which was no longer appearing, might have been perceived in the way it had. They gave an assurance that they would not repeat the approach and that they would remove any posts of a similar nature. They intended to seek guidance in future to ensure that their content was in line with the Code.","The ASA first assessed whether the post was an ad for the purposes of the Code. The video was posted on get_0ut_0f_debt’s business account on TikTok. Text showing the TikTok handle for the page appeared on screen throughout the video. We considered that viewers would understand that the video, which referenced debt problems, promoted the service offered by get_0ut_0f_debt. We therefore considered that the video constituted an ad for the purposes of the Code. The CAP Code required that ads be prepared with a sense of responsibility to the audience and to society and not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. They must not cause fear or distress without justifiable reason and, if it could be justified, the fear or distress should not be excessive. The video showed a man placing a cord around his neck. He was then seen lying face down on the floor and did not respond to an attempt to rouse him. The on-screen text referred to eviction due to debt and stated, “… everyone knows I’m not in a good place, can’t take it any more”. We considered that viewers would understand that the man was distressed due to being in debt and had chosen to end his life because of his financial situation. We considered that the depiction of colleagues rushing to help, alongside the implication that it was too late to save the man, added to the distressing tone. We considered that the ad, in highlighting and demonstrating a method of suicide, and creating an association between debt and suicide, was irresponsible, and that the graphic nature of the portrayal was likely to cause serious offence, and significant distress, which was not justified by its context. In particular, we considered that the question “can you relate?” was irresponsible in appealing to consumers who were experiencing problems with debt, who were likely to be particularly vulnerable. We concluded that the ad was irresponsible and likely to cause serious offence and unjustified distress. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.2 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Fern Brady,,"A paid-for ad for comedian Fern Brady, seen on the Sky News website on 18 August. The ad contained an image with the text “FERN BRADY” at the top and “I GAVE YOU MILK TO DRINK” overlayed on a stained-glass window. The image contained a woman with Fern Brady’s face, holding a baby, and spraying milk directly from her partially obscured breast into the mouth of a kneeling holy figure.","The complainant challenged whether the ad was offensive, because they believed it mocked the Christian faith.","Fern Brady explained that the image in the ad was a direct recreation of the religious painting titled “The Lactation of St. Bernard”. That artwork, created in the 17th century by Spanish painter Alonso Cano, depicted the Virgin Mary nursing St. Bernard of Clairvaux by spraying milk from her breast into his mouth. The painting was well known within Christian art and had been widely accepted and respected within religious contexts for centuries. The ad creatively referenced that image, by using satire and humour as part of Fern Brady’s comedic brand. The intention was not to mock or belittle the original religious significance, but to offer a contemporary interpretation that aligned with her public persona as a comedian known for her irreverent style and her religious up-bringing. The text “I GAVE YOU MILK TO DRINK” overlayed a stained-glass window, which emphasised the artistic and cultural reference rather than aiming to offend. Efforts had been made to avoid any unintentional offence, in particular by covering Fern’s breast with a beam of light, which differed from the original painting. Fern Brady acknowledged that religious imagery was a sensitive area, and had approached the ad with the knowledge that the original painting was a respected piece of Christian art. However, humour was also subjective, and she believed while some may have found the portrayal distasteful, that did not necessarily mean it was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. Fern Brady believed that in the context of satire and artistic reenactment, the ad instead reflected a long tradition of artistic reinterpretation. Sky UK Ltd told us that the ad was not individually reviewed or cleared for use. They instead followed their standard processes whereby available advertising had to clear their advertiser and category block-lists, which the ad did. They were not aware of receiving any complaints directly.","The CAP Code stated that ads must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. Particular care must be taken to avoid causing offence on certain grounds, including religion or belief. We acknowledged Fern Brady’s comment that the ad was based on the religious painting titled “The Lactation of St. Bernard”, which we understood showed the miracle of Chatillon-sur-Seine, in which St. Bernard received divine grace from the Virgin Mary. We understood that the painting on which the image was based had been selected for comic effect. Because of the subject matter of Fern Brady’s material, the effect had been compounded by deviations from the original painting, such as her knowing the text “I GAVE YOU MILK TO DRINK”, a ray of light shining through a stained glass window and across her breast, and the more exaggerated presentation of the milk. Regardless of consumers’ familiarity with the painting, or the content of Fern Brady’s work, we considered the ad, which appeared on a general news website, was likely to be seen as depicting the Virgin Mary, a highly revered individual in the Christian tradition, breastfeeding an adult holy figure in a church setting, for the purposes of humour. In that context, we considered that the ad was likely to be seen as mocking the religious figures shown.

ASA Ruling on 247 Home Furnishings Ltd t/a 247Blinds,,"A website for 247Blinds, www.247blinds.co.uk, seen on 8 July 2024, included the text that stated “Made-to-Measure Quality Blinds…WITHOUT HAVING YOUR EYES OUT! […] Blind envy starts here…” alongside an image of a person with paint splatters and stars over their eyes.","The complainant, who was severely sight impaired, challenged whether the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread offence.","247 Home Furnishings t/a 247 Blinds stated that the term “having your eyes out” was widely recognised as an expression used to signify someone’s eyes popping out in disbelief to show unfavourable surprise when faced with something that was overpriced. Their intention was to convey that customers would be pleasantly surprised by their prices and so would not “have their eyes out” when they saw them. Whilst they acknowledged that the play on words “Quality Blinds” may have been seen as in poor taste, they believed that most people would have found it humorous, rather than seriously offensive. This was the only complaint they had received and it had been viewed on their website by 182,000 users and had been shown on various online platforms, resulting in over 1.7 million impressions during this period. The campaign finished at the end of July and would no longer be available online.","The CAP Code required marketers to ensure that ads did not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence, with particular care to be taken to avoid causing offence on the grounds of various protected characteristics, including disability. We acknowledged that the claim “Quality Blinds” was intended as a humorous play on words related to the advertiser’s product, window blinds, and the verb, to blind. We also acknowledged that the claim “Having your eyes out” was an expression known to some people to mean your eyes popping out in disbelief at something, for example, a high price. However, we considered that all the elements of the ad seen together, the play on words, “Quality Blinds”, the use of the expression “WITHOUT HAVING YOUR EYES OUT!” and the image of the person with stars and paint splatters covering their eyes, would be understood as a reference to blindness, and had the effect of making light of the disability. We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious offence to some people. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 4.1 (Harm and Offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told 247 Home Furnishings Ltd t/a 247 Blinds to ensure that their future ads did not cause serious or widespread offence, particularly on the grounds of disability.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/247-home-furnishings-ltd-a24-1251708-247-home-furnishings-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on John Mills Ltd t/a JML Direct,,"A three-minute TV ad for JML’s Hurricane Spin Scrubber, seen on 7 January 2024, depicted a number of women using the cleaning tool in bathrooms, kitchens and other home environments. The ad included a male and female host. The male host described the product and demonstrated how it worked. Four of the women described their experiences with the tool, saying, “As soon as I started using the spin scrubber, it’s so powerful it made cleaning so much easier”; “I love using the extension pole to get the rings out of the bathtub. I love it”; “I’ve given this to my mother as a gift, and it has changed the way she cleans. I don’t have to worry about her slipping she just clips it in, cleans the top of the shower and I don’t have to worry anymore”; and “My favourite brush is the cone brush, it’s amazing. It gets all the little crevices, nooks and crannies. It gets all that calcium built up around the sink and around the tub and faucets.” A male voice-over concluded, “To get your hands on the Hurricane Spin Scrubber and a sparkling clean home call now, or visit jmldirect.com.”","The complainant, who believed the ad perpetuated harmful gender stereotypes by depicting only women in a role that was stereotypically female, and implying that only women cleaned or were interested in cleaning products, challenged whether it breached the Code.","John Mills Ltd t/a JML stated that they had updated their advertising following an ASA ruling in 2021 regarding a TV ad for the JML Hurricane Spin Scrubber which the ASA had concluded had presented gender stereotypes in a way that was likely to cause harm. They believed that the new ad, which featured a male presenter who was shown demonstrating and using the product, provided more of a gender balance. Clearcast stated that they had taken into consideration the previous ruling and that the new ad was in line with the CAP and BCAP “Advertising Guidance on depicting gender stereotypes likely to cause harm or serious or widespread offence”. The new ad included a male presenter who was shown demonstrating and using the product. The women’s testimonials talked only about the product’s functionality. There was no mention of taking pride in the appearance of their house or being judged for their cleaning, nor was there any mention of cleaning up after other people in the house. They believed this removed any impression of cleaning being solely the woman’s responsibility and never done by men. There was no implication that men could not or would not do cleaning in a house. Although the ad featured people undertaking gender stereotypical roles, they believed the inclusion of the male presenter talking about and demonstrating the product, meant that they avoided suggesting that stereotypical roles, cleaning in this case, were uniquely associated with one gender and not carried out by the other.","Upheld The BCAP Code stated that ads must not include gender stereotypes that were likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence. Joint CAP and BCAP guidance stated that gender-stereotypical characteristics included attributes or behaviours usually associated with a specific gender. The guidance stated that ads may feature people undertaking gender-stereotypical roles, such as showing women cleaning, but they should take care to avoid suggesting that stereotypical roles or characteristics were: always uniquely associated with one gender; the only options available to one gender; or never carried out or displayed by another gender. The ad showed a number of women using the product in domestic settings such as kitchens and bathrooms, three of whom described aspects of the product’s functionality, how that related to what they used it for and how much they liked the product. Another woman described how she gave the product to her mother because she was concerned about her safety when reaching to clean the top of her shower. There were also a number of shots of people cleaning or holding the product which showed only the hand or torso of individuals. The ASA considered that many of the torso shots could be identified as being of women, because of their body-shape. It was not easy, however, to distinguish whether the shots of the hands were those of men or women, because they were brief. The ad also included a male host and a female host. We therefore considered that, with the exception of the male host, the ad only featured people who could be readily identified as women. The only readily identifiable man in the ad was one of the hosts. Whilst he was shown demonstrating the features of the product, he did so in his role as an employee of the company, rather than commenting on or showing how he personally used the product to clean his home. We considered that the juxtaposition of the male host in an authoritative position explaining and demonstrating how the product could be used alongside several women using and talking about their personal experiences of using the product to clean their home, reinforced the harmful gender stereotype that cleaning the home was the responsibility of women, and that men did not share that responsibility. Furthermore, the male host was accompanied by a female host who did not demonstrate or describe the features of the product herself, but instead observed and assisted him. In the context of the ad, we considered that this reinforced the harmful gender stereotype that it was a woman’s role to assist men, which contributed to the wider impression that it was their role to keep the home clean rather than a man’s. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad presented gender stereotypes in a way that was likely to cause harm and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP Code rule 4.14 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told John Mills Ltd t/a JML to ensure that their advertising did not present gender stereotypes in a way that was likely to cause harm, including by suggesting that cleaning the home was a responsibility uniquely associated with women.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/john-mills-ltd-a24-1228444-john-mills-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Gamehaus Network Technology Co Ltd,,"An in-app ad for the mobile game Whispers: Interactive Romance Stories, seen on 30 October 2023 in the mobile game app Virtual Families 3. The ad featured an animated scene of a blindfolded woman kneeling on the floor while a man standing in front of her held her face in his hand. A speech bubble appeared which was labelled “Niece”. She said to him, “Uncle, please punish me.” On-screen text then appeared which stated “20 years ago”. The scene cut to the woman as a young child at a funfair. She said, “Uncle, this place is so fun!” He held out his arms, lifted her into the air and nuzzled into her cheek. She said to him, “Uncle, I will marry you when I grow up!” The ad then returned to the opening scene with the woman blindfolded in a kneeling position and her statement, “Uncle, please punish me.” Two buttons appeared: “Accept” and “Reject”. An animated finger reached out from the bottom of the screen as though it was going to press the “Accept” button and then did the same thing with the “Reject” button.","The complainant who challenged whether, by featuring a potentially incestuous relationship between an uncle and his niece, the ad was offensive and irresponsible.","Gamehaus Network Technology Co Ltd did not respond to the ASA's enquiries.Last Day of Work LLC, publishers of the Virtual Families 3 app in which the ad was seen, said they would ensure the ad and any similar content from the advertiser would not appear in their games in future.","Upheld The ASA was concerned by Gamehaus Network Technology Co Ltd's lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The ad appeared in the Virtual Families 3 mobile game, which had a PEGI 3 rating meaning it was suitable for people of all ages, including children. It highlighted the relationship between an uncle and his niece. In the first and last scenes, she was portrayed as an adult and was blindfolded in a kneeling position. She said, “Uncle, please punish me.” We considered that consumers would be likely to understand from her blindfolded, kneeling stance and her request to be punished that she appeared willing to engage in sado-masochistic, sexual behaviour with her uncle. We further considered that the flashback to the funfair scene when she was a child and her statement that she would marry her uncle when she was grown up, added to the impression of them having an incestuous relationship and had overtones of a child being viewed as a sexual object and groomed by an adult relative. We concluded that the ad had the effect of portraying a child in a sexual way. Because the ad featured scenes depicting an incestuous relationship between an uncle and his niece, and suggested that a child had been sexualised and groomed by an adult, we concluded it was likely to cause serious and widespread offence in any medium in which it appeared, and portrayed a child in a sexual way and was therefore irresponsible. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising), 4.1 and 4.8 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Gamehaus Network Technology Co Ltd to ensure future ads were prepared responsibly and did not cause serious or widespread offence, including by featuring incest, depicting a child as a sexual object or being groomed by an adult.

ASA Ruling on Grandbing Technology Co Ltd t/a On Fancy,,"A website for Onfancy, www.onfancy.co.uk, an online clothing retailer seen on 1 November 2023, featured a product listing for a child’s swimsuit. Four images in the ad showed a female child model wearing a one-shoulder swimsuit with a cut out feature on one side at the waist. All the images were cropped to show the model’s face from the mouth downwards and were cut off at thigh level. In three of the images the model’s arm was raised to touch her hair. One image showed the front view of the model with one leg slightly raised. The other three images showed the model in a standing pose viewed from the front, side and back respectively.","The complainant, who believed that the ad portrayed the child model in a sexualised way, challenged whether it was irresponsible and breached the Code.",Grandbing Technology Ltd t/a Onfancy did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"Upheld The ASA was concerned by Onfancy’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. We considered that the model in the ad appeared to be between seven and ten years of age and was definitely under the age of 18.The ad showed images of the model wearing a swimsuit. In the two front view images, the outline of her genitalia appeared to be visible under the swimsuit. We considered that, while that styling may not have been intentional, it was inappropriate and had the effect of sexualising the young model. The images were cropped so that the model’s face was visible only from the mouth downwards. We considered that this anonymised the model and focused the reader’s attention on her body. In the context of an ad for a child’s swimsuit where clothing was limited and tight-fitting, we considered such an approach also had the effect of sexualising the model. In three of the images her arm was raised to touch her hair. In one of the front view images her leg was raised and in the other her legs were slightly apart. In three of the images her head was tilted to the side and she was touching her hair, While not overtly sexual, we considered that the poses had a seductive tone and were quite adult for a model who was clearly under 18. The model also appeared to be wearing red lip gloss, which, emphasised and drew attention to her lips. In the image taken from behind, we considered that the model’s bottom and legs were the main focus and that also had the effect of sexualising her. We considered that those elements in combination had the effect of portraying the model in a sexualised way. Because we considered that the ad depicted a person who appeared to be under the age of 18 in a sexual way, we concluded that it was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising) and 4.8 (Harm and offence).",We told Grandbing Technology Ltd t/a Onfancy to ensure that in future their ads did not portray someone who appeared to be under 18 years of age in a sexualised way.

ASA Ruling on Outsourceful Ltd t/a Outsourceful,,"An email and website www.outsourceful.co.uk for Outsourceful, a recruitment agency, was seen on 11 August 2023: a. The email, which was from Property Industry Eye, a residential property industry news outlet, for Outsourceful stated “if your employees can work remotely, why pay £20ph in the UK when you could pay £5ph using us! we make it cost £5 per hour for one who speaks English perfectly… hire someone who won’t call in sick on Monday morning… one who will give 110% effort. Outsourceful hiring: 1. let us know the job role 2. we find the perfect remote fulltime employee 3. they cost you £950 per month for a 40 hour week We provide outsourced employees for your estate or lettings agency. We hire predominantly in the Philippines as they speak with an American-like accent, they are extremely hard working and very service oriented. They’ll work your UK hours, and will be more dedicated to your team than your UK workers. If you’ve got an admin role going, or you need a client accountant, or someone to just chase those bloody CP12s, or need simply a social media manager. These roles usually cost £950-1150 a month all in, that includes salary, taxes, literally everything. […] One agency has now saved £66k per year on salaries.” At the bottom of the email were photos of three Filipino women and their employment profiles beneath the heading “Meet some of our recent employees”. b. The website www.outsourceful.co.uk included a page which stated “Lettings & Estate Agent employees from £950 p/m”. The page included a ""Cost Comparison"" between the UK and the Philippines. Underneath ""United Kingdom"" text stated ""£20.10 p/h"" and listed alongside question marks ""18.05% Employer Taxes"", ""28 Days Holiday"", ""Strict Employment Laws"", ""High Staff Turnover"" and ""Low Productivity"". Underneath ""Philippines"" text stated ""£5 p/h"" and listed alongside tick marks ""10% employer taxes"", ""10 days holiday"", ""Very Hardworking"", ""Service Orientated"", ""Native English Speakers"". Text underneath the comparison stated “Hire 2 Employees for the price of 1 UK person”. The page included the same employment profiles from three Filipino women as ad (a). Under the section headed “They can…” text included “100% fluent in English with American-like dialects” and “Hard-working and diligent and no need to micromanage”. At the bottom of the page was a “FAQ” section. In response to the question “Proficient in English?”, text stated “Yes, we only recruit employees fully proficient in spoken and written English. In the Philippines, people have an American-like accent, and are extremely service oriented and your customers will not think they’re being scammed”.","The complainant, who believed the ads perpetuated negative racial stereotypes, challenged whether they were harmful and likely to cause serious offence.","In relation to ad (a), Outsourceful Ltd said the claim that they “make it cost £5 per hour for one who speaks English perfectly…” was factually correct; all their employees spoke English perfectly. In relation to the claim that potential employers could “hire someone who won’t call in sick on Monday morning”, if one of their remote employees called in sick, they provided a replacement person immediately, who was equally qualified. With regard to the “Cost Comparison” between the UK and the Philippines in ad (b), they said they had data to support the claims made about high staff turnover and low productivity in the UK from credible external sources. It was true that the UK had stricter employment laws than the Philippines. Their employees were very hard working, service orientated and spoke English natively. Notwithstanding their defence of the ads, they said they had made extensive changes to their website to address the concerns raised, and that they would not use the email ad (a), or similar emails again. Property Industry Eye Ltd said that they were paid by Outsourceful to send the email (ad (a)) to their database of subscribers. Outsourceful provided the content for the email which was clearly prefaced by the words “An offer from a client”. Property Industry Eye had no editorial control over the content of the email. They checked the email content prior to sending for unsuitable or inappropriate content and found there to be none. They did not receive any complaints from their subscribers.","Upheld The CAP code required marketers to ensure that ads were prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, and did not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence, with particular care to be taken to avoid causing offence on grounds of various protected characteristics, including race. CAP Advertising Guidance on avoiding racial and ethnic stereotypes likely to cause harm or serious or widespread offence, stated that even racial or ethnic stereotypes that may be seen as complimentary (for example, being intelligent, hard-working, strong or athletic), also had the potential to contribute to the generalisation of vastly diverse groups, and reinforce or promote limiting beliefs about that particular group or others, and therefore to cause harm. We understood that there was a stereotype that Asian people were hard workers and self-sufficient. We also understood that Filipino people frequently migrated for work abroad. In the UK in 2022, people from the Philippines were the second largest group of foreign domestic workers by country issued with worker visas. Although the ads related to remote workers based in the Philippines, and not those who had migrated from the Philippines to the UK to work, we nonetheless considered there was a risk that ads that reinforced or promoted stereotypes regarding Filipino people’s work ethic, including a propensity not to take sickness absence, could be harmful to both groups and leave them open to exploitation. The ads were for a recruitment company that sourced remote workers who were living in the Philippines and promoted them on the basis that they were significantly cheaper than UK workers, spoke English fluently, would not call in sick, were extremely hard working and service oriented, would work UK hours and be more dedicated than UK workers. Ad (b) also included a comparison with the UK, including that Filipino workers had fewer days of annual leave. We sought a view on the ads from the Kanlungan Filipino Consortium, a charity representing Filipino and other migrant communities in the UK. Their view was that the ads used language which supported racial and ethnic stereotypes about Filipino workers. They considered that such stereotypes might influence UK companies to recruit Filipino and other East and Southeast Asian migrants on low wages, which could increase cases of labour exploitation and trafficking amongst Filipino workers, both in the Philippines and abroad. We considered that the claims in ad (a) “hire someone who won’t call in sick on a Monday morning” and “one who will give 110% effort” played on existing stereotypes of Asian people being hard workers, which could reinforce harmful stereotypes, and leave them open to exploitation by employers. We further considered that the description in ad (a) of people from the Philippines as “Very Hardworking” and “Service Oriented”, and the claim in ad (b) that “In the Philippines, people have an American-like accent, and are extremely service oriented” generalised about people from the Philippines, a diverse population, in a way which was likely to perpetuate harmful stereotypes. We further considered that the text underneath the comparison which stated “Hire 2 Employees for the price of 1 UK person” promoted a harmful stereotype of workers from the Philippines offering cheap, commoditised labour. On that basis we concluded that the ads had not been prepared in a socially responsible way because they promoted harmful racial stereotypes and that they were also likely to cause serious offence to some people. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social Responsibility) and 4.1 (Harm and offence).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Outsourceful Ltd to ensure that they avoided causing harm or serious offence, particularly on the grounds of race.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/outsourceful-ltd-a23-1208780-outsourceful-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on FunPlus International AG t/a Funplus,,"An ad for the mobile app game Stormshot: Isle of Adventure, seen in the mobile app game Hill Climb Racing 2 on 7 October 2023, featured a dark room with a man approaching whilst carrying a torch. He shone the torch in a young woman’s face. She was lying in bed, her hands were gripping the top of her covers and she had a frightened look on her face. The scene then cut to him lifting up her skirt, revealing her bare legs. A voice-over and on-screen text stated “The drunk soldier slowly approached the girl, lifted up her skirt and then started to play Stormshot”. The ad then cut to scenes of animated gameplay from Stormshot.","The complainant, who believed that the ad trivialised and condoned sexual assault against women, challenged whether it was irresponsible, offensive and harmful.","FunPlus International AG t/a FunPlus Interactive said the ad had been published during the period 21 September to 14 October 2023 via Facebook Ads in third-party apps selected by the Facebook algorithm. Publication was limited to the age-restricted category 18+ only. The ad was not published in any other media or platform. As soon as they became aware of the ad they ensured it was immediately withdrawn on 14 October 2023. They said they would not publish the ad, or similar content, in future. They had provided additional training to staff and external agencies on their internal policies, which incorporated complying with the CAP Code, including rules regarding social responsibility and harm and offence. Fingersoft, publishers of the Hill Climb Racing 2 app in which the ad was seen, explained that it had inadvertently got through their pre-inspection measures. They also had measures in place to take action when a player reported an ad using their in-game support form, but that relied on the form being submitted soon after the ad had appeared and before the campaign had been turned off by another publisher or the ad network. They said they would block FunPlus Interactive's ads from appearing in their games in future if there was any indication that those ads featured similar content.","Upheld The CAP Code required that ads must not cause serious or widespread offence and must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. It also required that ads must contain nothing that is likely to condone or encourage violence or anti-social behaviour and must not include gender stereotypes in a way that is likely to cause harm. The ad had been published in the Hill Climb Racing 2 game app, which had a rating of being suitable for everyone and therefore was likely to be seen by children as well as adults. The opening scene of the ad featured a man emerging from the darkness and approaching a woman in bed. She was gripping the covers and looked distressed as he shone a torch at her. The scene then cut to him lifting up her skirt, revealing her bare legs. The voice-over and on-screen text stated “The drunk soldier slowly approached the girl, lifted up her skirt and then started to play Stormshot”. The ASA considered that the mood of the ad was dark and threatening. Although the final part of the voice-over and on-screen text stated that the man then played Stormshot, we considered consumers would interpret the ad as suggesting the man was going to sexually assault the woman without her consent and the only thing to distract him and stop him from doing so was by playing Stormshot, a video game. We considered that by implying an act of sexual violence was going to take place and that it was only interrupted because of the man’s greater desire to play the game, the ad trivialised and condoned sexual assault and sexual violence. By presenting the woman as an object of sexual gratification in that way the ad also included a gender stereotype, which was likely to cause harm. We concluded the ad was likely to cause serious and widespread offence in any medium in which it appeared, that it had not been prepared in a socially responsible manner and therefore breached the Code. We welcomed FunPlus Interactive’s assurance that they would not publish the ad or similar content in future. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Responsible advertising), 4.1, 4.4 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on GIRLvsCANCER,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An outdoor poster for the “Smash the Stigma” campaign from the charity GIRLvsCANCER, seen in October 2023. The ad featured a close-up image of a woman’s torso, as she held one of her breasts in her hand, with her arm obscuring her other breast. The top of her other hand was placed between her legs. Large white text the length of the image stated “CANCER WON’T BE THE LAST THING THAT F*CKS ME”. Text at the bottom of the poster stated the charity’s name. Further text at the bottom right of the image, next to a QR code, stated “SMASH THE STIGMA”.",Two complainants challenged whether the ad was: 1. likely to cause serious or widespread offence; and 2. inappropriate for display in an untargeted medium.,"1 & 2. GIRLvsCANCER said that the ad had intended to represent the real-life experience of women regarding sex and cancer, and the emotions they had experienced. They accepted that this might have made some people feel uncomfortable, but did not believe the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. GIRLvsCANCER said that the imagery in the ad had been carefully crafted so that both of the model’s breasts had been covered, and no other body parts beyond her main torso were visible. GIRLvsCANCER said they took matters of social responsibility seriously. They believed raising awareness of the issues the ad addressed showed a wider sense of societal responsibility, by representing the views and experiences of an under-represented section of society. They did not think the language or images used in the ad had been gratuitous, but rather were relevant to the lived experiences and issues faced by many women with cancer. They felt the use of the word “fuck” was in-keeping with and necessary for the campaign message and creative execution, and re-iterated that the ad had been based on close collaboration with the women whose stories they were conveying. They wanted the ad to spark conversations about how women felt during and after diagnosis and treatment for cancer, because they believed encouraging people to talk was the most effective way to enact change. They said the model, and all other models in the wider campaign were cancer survivors or those currently with cancer, who they had worked with to portray their stories in a way which reflected their experiences. Build Hollywood, the media owner, said that the ad had been removed by the time they were made aware of the complaint. They thought that the ad touched on an important topic which was too often perceived to be a taboo subject, and deserved to be highlighted and talked about openly. They said they had not intended to offend viewers, but rather to educate them, as well as support the cancer community and reduce stigma surrounding the issue. They said that due to the subject matter depicted in the ad, the poster had not been distributed within 100 m of a school. They confirmed that had not received any direct complaints.","1. & 2.Upheld The CAP Code required marketers to avoid causing serious or widespread offence. The ASA acknowledged that the wording of the ad did not explicitly use the word “FUCKS”. However, we considered that the use of an asterisk to obscure the letter “U” in the ad meant that viewers were likely to understand the word as a reference to the expletive “fuck”. We noted the context in which the word appeared, and that the full text stated “CANCER WON’T BE THE LAST THING THAT F*CKS ME” which we considered viewers would understand to be an allusion to a colloquial term for sexual intercourse. We considered that the combination of the image of the woman holding her breast with her other hand placed between her legs, alongside the text, further contributed to that impression. Because of that, we also considered viewers were likely to interpret the images in the ad as depicting sexual behaviour in an explicit manner. We acknowledged GIRLvsCANCER’s comments that the ad was meant to represent the lived experience of women who had, or who had survived, cancer, and had been created to raise awareness of the subject. We also acknowledged their belief that the imagery and language used in the ad had been carefully chosen and was not gratuitous. However, we considered that “fuck” was a word so likely to offend that it should not generally be used or alluded to in advertising, even if viewers would understand that the ads were intended to raise awareness of women’s experience with cancer. We further considered that, within the context of the ad, the image was sufficiently sexually explicit to be likely to offend viewers. For those reasons we concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious and widespread offence, and was therefore also inappropriate for display in an untargeted medium where it could be seen by children. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility) and rule 4.1 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about.

We swear by it”.","Two complainants, who believed that the bleeps alluded to expletives, challenged whether the ad: 1. was offensive; and 2. was unsuitable for children to hear.","1. & 2. Howe Tools said that, because Radiocentre had cleared the script, they understood that it was suitable for broadcast. They asserted that the words “fuck” and “fucking idiot” were not alluded to in the ads. They explained that, when the ads were recorded, the voice actors said the sound “beep” for the first two bleeps heard in the ads, and the word “bloody” for the third bleep, before the bleep sounds were added in post-production. To demonstrate that point, they supplied two audio graphs of the recordings, which showed that no sound was uttered alongside the first or second bleep. As such, they believed that those expletives could not be heard in either ad. They also highlighted that the word “bloody” was classified as a mild swear word according to Ofcom research. They said that the campaign was due to end shortly. Radiocentre said that, at the time of clearance, they believed that specific expletives could not be identified in the ad. They also referred to a CAP Advice article which only featured examples containing partially obscured expletives. Radio Experts, the production agency, explained the intention of the ads was to emphasise that Howe Tools were a reliable company that could be trusted. They believed that they had taken great care to ensure that the delivery was not aggressive or forceful in tone. They re-iterated that the expletive “fuck” was not recorded and therefore cannot be heard during the ads. Instead, they believed that the “ck” sound heard was the “click” at the end of the bleep sound. They also highlighted that they had created two ads, led by both male and female voices to ensure that neither gender was perceived negatively. Bauer confirmed that the ads were heard on Greatest Hits Radio in East Anglia. They explained that Greatest Hits plays classic hits from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and was therefore targeted at older audiences. They highlighted that the average age of a Greatest Hits Radio listener in East Anglia was 51 years, and that 98% of the audience were over 18 according to RAJAR data. They recognised that some listeners may have found the wordplay distasteful but believed that the ad was unlikely to cause widespread or serious offence with a mature audience. They referred to a previous ASA ruling concerning a TV ad which was not considered to have caused serious or widespread offence. It featured a well-known phrase and replaced the expletive with a word rhyming with that expletive. With that ruling in mind, they considered a bleeped out expletive which listeners were not able to hear was less likely to cause offence than a word which sounded very similar to an expletive. Global confirmed that the ads ran across different Heart Radio channels. They stated that the ads had been cleared by Radiocentre with no restrictions, and as such, believed that the ads were suitable for broadcast.","1. & 2. Upheld The BCAP Code stated that ads must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. The ads used “bleeps” to obscure certain words and phrases throughout in contexts where it appeared the person speaking might swear. We recognised that Howe Tools may have intended to refer to different expletives. However, we considered that listeners would interpret the bleeps as “fuck” or its derivatives, given the context of the ad and the way in which the bleeps were heard. For example, we considered that the sentence “you can go [bleep] yourself” heard in the ads would be understood as an allusion to the phrase “you can go fuck yourself”. We accepted that the word “fuck” had not been said by the voice actors when recording, though we considered that they had said the word “bleep” instead, and that would have been intended to be heard as an expletive. We also noted that in ad (b), the last two letters of the expletive “fuck” appeared to be audible in the second bleep, which, although we acknowledged was likely as a result of the bleep being added in post-production, we nevertheless considered further contributed to that impression. Within the narrative of the ads, it later transpired that the person speaking had supposedly not referred to expletives. However, we considered that the “intended” sentence was much longer than the bleep allowed for, and therefore, it was unlikely that listeners would believe that had been said instead of the expletive. We assessed the tone and meaning of the expletives which were alluded to in the ads. We considered that “fuck” was a word so likely to offend that it should not generally be used or alluded to in advertising. We further considered that phrases such as “fuck yourself” and “fucking idiot” would likely be considered aggressive in nature, even if listeners understood that the ads were intended to be humorous. For those reasons we concluded that the allusion to expletives in ads with a general adult audience was likely to cause serious offence, and therefore, that the ads were also unsuitable to be heard by children. The ads breached BCAP Code rules 1.2 (Responsible Advertising) and 4.2 (Harm and Offence).",The ad must not appear in the form complained of. We told Howe Tools to avoid alluding to expletives which were likely to cause serious offence.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/howe-tools-ltd-g23-1215545-howe-tools-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Whaleco UK Ltd t/a Temu,"Summary of Council decision: Four issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","Four display ads and an in-app ad for Temu, an online marketplace: a. The first display ad seen on a regional online newspaper on 19 June 2023, featured six images in a row. The first image was of a young girl wearing a bikini, the girl was shown looking at the camera, one hand on her hip and the other pushing her hair behind her ear. The second image was of a woman wearing a white halterneck dress, the image was cut so only her torso and arms were shown. The third image was of a silver metallic facial roller. The fourth image was of three balloon tying tools in pink, red and blue colours. The fifth image was a woman wearing a white crop top. Only the woman’s chest, arms and midriff were shown. The sixth image was of a grey jock strap. b. The second display ad seen on a chess website on 18 June 2023, featured six images. The first image featured a woman wearing a burgundy one shoulder jumpsuit that was cut at one side showing part of the woman’s midriff, the top of her chest and her left arm. The image was cut just below the woman’s eyes, showing the bottom part of her face only. The second image was of padded cycling underwear. The third image was of three balloon tying tools in pink, red and blue. The fourth image was a woman wearing a grey tight fitting jumpsuit. The image was cut to show her face from the eyes down to the top part of her thighs only. The fifth image was of a grey jock strap. The sixth image was a pair of red boots. c. The third display ad seen on a chess website on 17 June 2023, featured three of the images seen in ad (b); the woman wearing a burgundy jumpsuit, padded cycling underwear and three balloon tying tools in pink, red and blue. d. The fourth display ad seen on a language translation website on 18 June 2023, featured eight images. Five that were also in ad (b); three balloon tying tools in pink, red and blue, padded cycling underwear, a woman wearing a burgundy jumpsuit, a pair of red boots and a woman wearing a grey jumpsuit. The sixth image was featured in ad (a) and was a woman wearing a white halterneck dress. The seventh image was of a woman wearing a tight fitting pink cat suit, the woman’s head was not shown. The eighth image was of a rubber pink foot massager. e. The in-app ad seen within a puzzle app on the 18 June 2023, featured images of leopard print underwear with the back removed and a woman wearing a short black skirt and tights, only the woman’s legs were shown.","The ASA received five complaints. 1. Three complainants, who considered that the content of ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) were sexually graphic, objected that the ads were likely to cause serious or widespread offence. 2. One complainant, who believed the pose and clothing of the model in a bikini, sexualised someone who was a child, challenged whether ad (a) was irresponsible and offensive. 3. Two complainants, who believed ads (a), (b) and (c) sexually objectified women, challenged whether they were offensive and irresponsible. 4. Two complainants challenged whether ads (b), (c) and (e) were inappropriately targeted.","1. Whaleco UK Ltd t/a Temu said they were a global online platform, launched in the United Kingdom in 2023. Third-party sellers listed and sold a wide range of products on their marketplace. The product descriptions, including the images, displayed on the marketplace were provided by the third parties. Sellers were obliged to adhere to Temu’s marketplace policies which prohibited pornographic, obscene or harassing images. Regarding the silver metallic facial roller, balloon tying tools, padded cycling underwear, jock strap, red boots and foot massager, Temu said the images shown were the products in their original state unaltered. They were found on the manufacturer’s website and other e-commerce platforms. They believed the images were not sexual or offensive. Bylines Network, the regional newspaper publisher where ad (a) appeared, stated they had strict controls to prevent inappropriate advertising and proactively blocked sensitive content. However, as the ad was listed as a shopping site the content had been permitted. They stated that the advertiser was selling items they did not want displayed on their platforms and they had now blocked Temu from future advertising on their websites. The chess website, where ads (b) and (c) appeared, explained that while they did not operate direct control over what companies advertise on their website, they did put in place strict guidelines for their third-party Ad Management Partner (AMP) to ensure that images with sexual content, gambling, alcohol or any other categories seen as inappropriate for the general public were prohibited. The AMP was then responsible for ensuring compliance with the guidelines. They believed Temu, as an e-commerce platform, was not considered a part of any banned category. However, after reviewing the ads, they confirmed the images displayed did not align with their values and therefore, had contacted their AMP to prevent Temu ads being shown on their platform again. In addition, they had asked their AMP that similar content and images would not be shown on their website again. 2. Temu explained that the image of the child in the bikini in ad (a) was provided by the seller and violated Temu’s marketing policy. The image had been removed from their Google Ads account and would not be shown again. 3. Temu said that images of models without a face were not intended to sexually objectify the women. The pictures were there to show customers a clear representation of how the clothing was worn and helped them to select goods to purchase. They explained that a similar approach could be found on other e-commerce platforms. They said the images contained no description or language that sexually objectified women. They had not used the women’s features as a way to draw attention to an unrelated product. The clothes themselves did not feature any offensive words or slogans. The images further had not focused on the model’s specific body parts and had not been presented in such a way as to feel voyeuristic. The models were all appropriately dressed and were not posed in a sexual way. 4. Temu said all the ads were served by Google Ads. Over one million product descriptions and images were uploaded to their Google Ads account, labelled by product category, price range and sales volume. Temu chose the product categories to be promoted and Google Ads used their algorithm to pick products from that category and serve them. If Temu did not pick an ad category, Google Ads would select the most appropriate one from all product categories. Temu said they did not get to decide the specific products advertised, the arrangement or combination of products or the websites/apps that the ads were displayed on.","1. Upheld The disputed images were a silver metallic facial roller, which appeared in ad (a), balloon ties, that appeared in ads (a), (b), (c) and (d), a jockstrap, found in ads (a) and (b), cycling underwear, that appeared in ads (b), (c) and (d) and a foot massager, found in ad (d) only. All the objects in the ads were therefore either underwear or household products. However, no accompanying text, explanation or context was given about the items. Therefore, the nature of the products and their original intended use, were not easily identifiable. Both the facial roller and balloon ties were phallic shaped and in the absence of any explanation could have been interpreted as sexual in nature. The foot massager, which was plastic and tapered to a round end, could also have been understood in the same way. Regarding the underwear, the jockstrap was augmented in the crotch, emphasising the outline of genitalia. The cycling underwear, which had pink padding at the back, was not immediately clear it was for cycling and appeared as underwear with the bottom cut out. Both items, especially juxtaposed with the other products, appeared to be sexual in nature, rather than functional underwear. The disputed images in ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) all appeared alongside images of adult women wearing tight fitting clothing that accentuated their body shape. While the portrayals of the women in isolation were not necessarily sexual, the styling of the images, including the revealing nature of the clothing, meant that their inclusion alongside products that appeared to be sexual in nature, added to the impression that the items and underwear were meant for an adult purpose, rather than functional objects. Ad (a) appeared on a regional online newspaper, ads (b) and (c) were seen on a chess website and ad (d) was found on a translation website. They were websites for general use and did not contain adult themed products or services of a sexual nature. The ASA noted Temu’s explanation that the items had not been chosen directly by them but picked by their ad server’s algorithm based on very broad product categories. However, while we acknowledged that Temu had stated there had been no intent to curate the ads in a sexual way, we assessed how they were likely to be interpreted by readers, regardless of the mechanics behind them. We considered that ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) taken in their entirety with the accompanying images of the models, and with no explanation or labelling, contained products that were likely to be seen as sexual in nature. The ads appeared in general media where adult themed or sexual products were unlikely to be anticipated. On that basis the ads were likely to cause widespread offence. On that point, ads (a), (b), (c) and (d) breached CAP code (Edition 12) rule 4.1 (Harm and offence). 2. Upheld We considered that the young model in ad (b) appeared to be a girl of eight to eleven years of age. The girl wore a two piece bikini. The image was cut off just beneath the bikini bottoms. The girl was posed with one hand on her hip and the other appearing to push her hair behind her ears. The pose was quite adult for a girl of her age and she appeared alongside two other images also in the ad that featured mature women modelling clothing intended for adults. We noted further the facial roller, balloon ties and jockstrap that were also displayed in the same ad. The lack of explanation and labelling meant that both the facial roller and balloon ties appeared to be items sexual in nature. Further to that the jockstrap, with its accentuated crotch, gave the impression of being sexual, rather than for utility. The collection of items portrayed together added to the impression that the ad was of a sexual nature and by association, therefore, the girl was sexualised. We concluded that the ad had the effect of portraying a child in a sexual way and was irresponsible. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social Responsibility) and 4.8 (Harm and offence). 3. Upheld Ad (a) showed a woman wearing a tight-fitting white dress, the image was cut so only her torso and arms were shown. A second image featured a woman wearing a white crop top and only her chest, arms and midriff were shown. The images appeared alongside a jockstrap and items such as a facial massager and balloon ties, which were phallic in shape and appeared sexual in nature. Further to that the jockstrap, with its accentuated crotch, gave the impression of being sexual, rather than for utility. Focusing on a person’s body while obscuring or removing their face was likely to be seen as objectifying. As the disembodied images of the women wearing tight and revealing clothing appeared alongside items that were likely to be understood as sexual, we considered the women were presented as stereotypical sexual objects. Ads (b) and (c) showed a woman wearing a one shoulder jumpsuit that was cut at one side exposing part of her midriff, the top of her chest and her left arm. A second image in ad (b) was of a woman wearing a tight fitting jumpsuit. We noted that the first image included the woman’s face from her nose downwards and the second image included her face from her eyes downwards. Therefore, unlike the models in ad (a), the women were represented more fully, rather than as reduced body parts. However, we again noted the context of the ads overall, with the accompanying images of a jockstrap in ad (b) and cycling underwear and the balloon tie in ads (b) and (c). We understood that the cycling underwear, in the absence of explanatory text or explanation, would be interpreted as underwear but not necessarily for cycling and noted the padded section appeared that there was a hole in the bottom and could have been seen as sexual. Further to that, the phallic shaped balloon tie and the jockstrap with the augmented crotch would have been seen as sexual in nature. The overall impression of the ads was that they featured sexual imagery of which the women in tight fitting, partially revealing clothing played a part. The women in ads (b) and (c) were therefore presented as stereotypical sexual objects. On that point, ads (a), (b) and (c) breached CAP code (Edition 12) rules 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence). 4. Upheld We considered that ads (b) and (c) featured content that sexually objectified women and ad (b) featured an image of a person under 18 years of age in a sexual way. Therefore they were unsuitable to be seen by audiences of any age, regardless of whether the advertiser had taken steps to target them towards audiences over 18. Ad (e) showed an image of backless leopard print underwear and we considered that the ad would be interpreted as promoting underwear of an adult nature. We therefore expected Temu to have targeted the ad responsibly including limiting the audience to users aged 18 years and over. That should have been achieved using age verification measures including interest-based targeting factors that described an adult audience and excluded a child audience. The puzzle app where ad (e) was served, was rated as “EVERYONE” in the Google Play App Store – meaning it was generally considered suitable for all age groups. Concerning ads (b) and (c) they appeared on a website for playing chess. We understood that chess had a wide appeal and so those under 18 would make up a significant number of those on the site. We understood that ads for Temu would not be served to those who were explicitly known to their ad server as under 18. However, if the user had an undeclared age they could be served any Temu ad and this included users of both the puzzle app and the chess website. Because ads (b) and (c) included objectifying material and we had not seen evidence to demonstrate that Temu had taken appropriate action to minimise the risk of under-18s being served for all the ads, for instance by using interest-based targeting factors, we concluded that they had not been responsibly targeted. On that point, ads (b), (c) and (e) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social Responsibility).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Whaleco UK Ltd t/a Temu to ensure that future ads were prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society and that they did not cause serious or widespread offence by presenting products in a sexual way in general media or by presenting individuals as stereotypical sexual objects. In addition, persons who were or appeared to be under 18 years of age in ads must not be portrayed in a sexual way and ads must be responsibly targeted.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/whaleco-uk-ltd-g23-1202845-whaleco-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on ThruDark Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An Instagram post from clothing retailer ThruDark, posted 18 July 2023, featured a video that began with a human-shaped figure wearing a hooded pink coat, seen at a distance standing against one of three wooden frames in front of an earth bank in a field. A person wearing a black hooded coat stepped into view close to the camera, pulled out a semi-automatic rifle and began shooting at the pink-coated figure. Slow motion close-ups showed bullet holes appearing in the coat. The black-hooded individual walked whilst firing, towards the pink-coated figure, changing magazines before pulling out a pistol and continuing to fire. A close-up of the pink-coated figure revealed that it was a mannequin. Further shots destroyed the mannequin’s head while a short scream was heard. The black-hooded individual walked away, towards a building with a corrugated iron roof, showing the ThruDark logo on the back of the coat. They then turned back, pulled out a shotgun that was hidden under the coat and began firing again. Large holes appeared in the mannequin’s head and torso and its head fell off. The black-hooded individual finally walked away and the video cut to a black screen with the text “There can be only one”, followed by ThruDark’s logo. Throughout the ad, classical music was played in the background. The video’s caption stated “‘There can be only one.’ #shroud #thrudark #endeavourthroughadversity”.","The ASA received 11 complaints. 1. The complainants, who believed the ad implied the pink-coated figure was female and the black-coated figured was male, challenged whether the ad was irresponsible, offensive and condoned and encouraged violence, particularly against women. 2. Some of the complainants challenged whether the ad was also irresponsible because it glamourised guns and gun violence.","1. & 2. ThruDark Ltd said they had a proud military heritage and had shown weaponry in previous brand communications and content as a reference to their background. They had established themselves as a brand that was known for their tongue-in-cheek humour and disruptive messaging. They said the ad’s scenario was filmed in good humour and had comedic intention. They had used classical music by Chopin in the background, which they specifically chose to soften and mock the crude nature of the scenario. Additionally, they had used the “Wilhelm scream” stock sound, an inside joke among sound designers, for slapstick comedic effect. They considered that the “Wilhelm scream” was particularly illustrative of the humorous nature of the ad. Some aspects were filmed in slow motion to lessen the sense of realism and heighten the slapstick tone, which was intended to parody the glamorisation of violence frequently shown on television. They considered it was clear from the beginning of the ad that the pink-coated figure was a mannequin. They said it was male in form and did not have feminine facial features, as shown in a “behind the scenes” video shared by a co-founder. They considered that if viewers believed the mannequin was female because it was wearing a pink changing robe, that belief was rooted in the viewer’s own prejudices. They said they had taken positions against the “shrink it and pink it” culture shown by other brands and pointed to previous posts in which they questioned why womenswear was equated with the colour pink. They had used the colour pink because that was the most radical visual departure from their signature black branding and it was the first, brightest-coloured robe they had to hand. They had consistently spoken out against brightly coloured clothing given their background in night operations as part of elite military units. They also did not consider that the black robe would be assumed to indicate the male gender. In the context of the music, comedy sound effects and slow motion, the contrast in the colour of the robes portrayed a fantastical battle between light and dark. The slogan “There can only be one” was a clear reference to the changing robe comparison. It also referenced the cult 1980s fantasy film Highlander, reinforcing the sense of fantastical battle. On the use of guns during the ad, they stated that the simple presence of a gun was not, in and of itself, evidence of a particular stance on gun usage. They said ads for violent action films, children’s toy guns and clay pigeon shooting were permissible on social media platforms. They considered the presence of weapons in the ad was in keeping with their brand’s military heritage and identity. They said that the ad was not irresponsible, because the actions took place in a secure firing range by a highly trained former UK Special Forces operator, and the use of an inanimate object minimised any potential risk of harm. They considered that it was clear that the location was a firing range and not a field because of the target stations, sand bank and covered firing positions. They also said that public disclaimers were messaged at the time. They believed it was not relevant that the firearms used were semi-automatic, but highlighted that the use of semi-automatic weapons would typically be considered to be less extreme than the use of automatic weapons.The ad did not include any form of encouragement or incitement of violence against minority groups, or anti-social behaviour. The ad was in line with their military heritage and was overall well received by the 350,000 people who had viewed it. In their view, the 11 complaints reflected the internalised biases of the complainants and did not evidence that the ad caused serious or widespread offence or was irresponsible. Meta said that they investigated the matter and had restricted the ad from appearing in the United Kingdom.","1. Upheld The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society. It further stated that marketing communications must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence and that particular care must be taken to avoid causing offence on the grounds of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability or age. The ad depicted a black-hooded figure repeatedly shooting at a figure wearing a pink coat. The ASA noted that the distinctive colouring of its coat was particularly prominent against the otherwise gloomy colour-scheme. While we agreed that colours were not inherently gendered, we considered that pink was culturally associated with femininity in the UK. In that context, we considered that the simplistic imagery of the stark contrast between the black and pink figures visually alluded to the figures being, respectively, male and female. A close-up of the mannequin’s delicate facial features, which when surrounded by the pink hood we considered would be read as feminine, further enhanced this contrast with the black-hooded figure. We considered that viewers would interpret the ad as alluding to a man shooting and killing a woman or as practising and preparing for a similar scenario. We considered that the ad glamorised and condoned that scenario and was unlikely to be understood as a parody. Rather than suggesting a comedic tone, we considered the use of gentle classical music, with slow-motion emphasis on the damage inflicted on the mannequin, added an eerie tone to the ad. We also considered only a small proportion of the ad’s audience were likely to recognise the “Wilhem scream” and be aware of its background. We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious and widespread offence, that it condoned and encouraged violence against women, and was irresponsible. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.4 (Harm and offence). 2. Upheld We understood the ad was intended to promote the changing robe worn by the black-hooded figure. We further understood that ThruDark had a military legacy as its founders had previously served in the UK Special Forces. While the ad was set in an outdoor environment and the brand was focused on outdoor clothing, we understood that the guns shown in the ad were not equipment which would typically be used for sport or legal hunting in the UK. We therefore considered that, in the context of an ad from a clothing retailer for outerwear, the presence of three semi-automatic firearms was incongruous and jarring. Throughout the ad, the black-hooded figure repeatedly fired at the mannequin using a semi-automatic rifle, pistol and shotgun, until its head fell off. We considered that the particular weapons used, and the relentless shooting at the target, displayed an extreme level of violence which, as referenced above, would not be interpreted as a comedic parody. Although we accepted that the inclusion of a gun in an ad would not always be irresponsible, we considered that the use of multiple guns (and the particular weapons used), in an ad which promoted an item of outerwear, together with the focus on the guns’ destructive capacity and the added emphasis of the slow-motion effect, glamorised guns and gun violence. We therefore concluded that the ad irresponsibly glamorised guns and condoned gun violence and was in breach of the Code. On that point the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.4 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told ThruDark Ltd to ensure that their ads were socially responsible, did not cause serious or widespread offence, and did not condone and encourage violence, particularly against women. We also told them not to glamorise guns and gun violence in their advertising.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/thrudark-ltd-g23-1206049-thrudark-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Alibaba.com Singapore E-commerce Private Ltd t/a Alibaba.com,,"A paid-for ad for Alibaba.com, an e-commerce platform, seen on the Daily Mail website on 28 April 2023, featured an image of a doll that took the form of a naked infant with an open mouth and realistic-looking female genitalia. The image appeared alongside two others that depicted a memory stick with a gun-shaped holder, and a lacy thong.","The complainant challenged whether the ad portrayed an infant in a sexualised way and was harmful, offensive and irresponsible.","Alibaba.com Singapore E-commerce Private Ltd t/a Alibaba.com stated that the product in question was a nursing mannequin and that they were aware of its sale on other e-commerce platforms. Nonetheless, they recognised the risk of the ad causing confusion or disturbance to certain audiences. They stated that the ad had potentially been placed on their behalf by a third-party ad network that generated and displayed ads on other websites via the algorithmically driven selection of product listings on their site. They provided some further detail about the mechanisms through which the ad might have appeared, although they were not able to be certain given they could not identify the specific page to which the ad directed visitors. They explained that the advertised product had been listed on their platform by a third-party seller and that they were not otherwise involved in its sale or manufacture. Upon receipt of the complaint, they removed the listing from their platform in order to enforce their own policies, which included that product listings on their platform must not feature images of genitalia. They added that their procedures included random spot-checks to ensure the compliance of approved listings. Associated Newspapers Ltd t/a Daily Mail, the ad’s publisher, stated that the ad was served on their website programmatically. They noted that, before serving ads on their website, some ad networks implemented an automated scanning process that aimed to ensure compliance. However, not all the ad networks responsible for their website’s advertising content offered that functionality. After receipt of the complaint, they took steps to prevent the ad reappearing on their site and added Alibaba.com to their list of blocked advertisers. They confirmed that no readers had complained to them directly.","Upheld The ad featured an image of a doll that took the form of a naked infant with spread legs, an open mouth, and realistic-looking female genitalia, but did not provide any information regarding the product’s function. The image appeared alongside two others depicting a memory stick with a gun-shaped holder and a lacy thong. The ASA understood that the advertised product was an infant nursing mannequin specifically designed for medical training. However, we considered that, in general, consumers would be unfamiliar with such mannequins. We considered that, in the context of a news website, consumers would not expect to served ads for medical training devices that depicted infants’ genitalia. Because of that, we considered that there was a high risk of consumers receiving the impression that the advertised product was a sex doll in the form of an infant. We further considered that impression was likely to be reinforced by the image’s juxtaposition with images of other products that had connotations of sex and violence. We concluded that the ad represented children in a sexualised way, was socially irresponsible, and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.8 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear in again in the form complained of. We told Alibaba.com Singapore E-commerce Private Ltd t/a Alibaba.com to ensure that their future ads were socially responsible, did not cause serious or widespread offence, or include images that portrayed or represented anyone who was, or seemed to be, under 18 years of age in a sexual manner.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/alibaba-com-singapore-e-commerce-private-ltd-a23-1196361-alibaba-com-singapore-e-commerce-private-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Tonic Nutrition Ltd t/a Tonic Health,"On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling was received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ads and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code . Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A website review page and an Instagram reel for Tonic Health, seen on 22 October 2024: a. The product review page on the Tonic Health website, www.tonichealth.co, contained testimonials from customers consisting of a star rating, customer name, title and a brief review. b. The Instagram reel, on Tonic Health’s account @tonichealth, entitled “THE BEST SLEEP SUPPLEMENT ON THE MARKET” promoted the “Rest & Recover Effervescent tablet”. It featured a video of a man in the supplements aisle of a supermarket who stated, “Are you struggling with sleep? Well, I’ve got just the thing for you […] Tonic have just launched our Rest & Recover, which is over 300 mg of bioavailable magnesium along with ashwagandha and lemon balm.” Nutritional information for the product appeared on-screen. The caption stated, “Struggling with sleep? I’ve got just the thing to help Introducing Tonic Rest & Recover Our new 4-in1 effervescent designed to support your sleep and recovery With a soothing cherry flavour, each effervescent blends 300mg of essential magnesium, 100mg of KSM-^^ Ashwagandha, and 500mg of calming lemon balm. This powerhouse combination helps ease stress, improve sleep, and support muscle recovery so you can wake up refreshed and ready for the [closing text cut off]”.",,"1. Tonic Nutrition Ltd t/a Tonic Health acknowledged that duplicated testimonials had appeared under different customer names. They said that was due to a technical error which had now been fully rectified. They said they had removed the testimonials in question and were implementing stricter internal processes in order to check all reviews and to ensure that there were no further errors of that type. 2. Tonic Health said they recognised that the claims “THE BEST SLEEP SUPPLEMENT ON THE MARKET” and “Are you struggling with sleep?” required substantiation through the Great Britain Nutrition and Health Claims Register (the GB NHC Register). They had therefore removed those claims from their advertising. Tonic Health said the phrase “Rest & Recover” was widely recognised as shorthand for rest and recuperation and was used colloquially to describe moments of winding down, particularly in the evening. They used the claim in that lifestyle and cultural context; in their view, it did not imply physiological change or health benefits. They believed that the Code did not automatically apply in circumstances where a phrase was clearly part of a product range or sub-brand and was not highlighted as an individual claim. Notwithstanding that, they always accompanied general phrases such as “Rest & Recover with a valid authorised health claim from the GB NHC Register. They said they used the claim “Magnesium contributes to the normal functioning of the nervous system” alongside relevant products.","The CAP Code stated that marketers must hold documentary evidence that a testimonial or endorsement used in a marketing communication was genuine, unless it was obviously fictitious, and hold contact details for the person who, or organisation, that gave it. The complainant reported having seen identical wording for a product review appear twice on the same page, attributed to two different customer names. The ASA considered the duplicated reviews created the misleading impression that more customers had independently submitted similar positive feedback than was actually the case. We understood that when the complainant approached Tonic Health in November 2024, they were told that the duplicated reviews had appeared in error due to a technical issue which had now been rectified. However, we understood that duplicated reviews continued to appear as late as January 2025. We welcomed Tonic Health’s assurances that the affected testimonials had been removed, that the issue had been fully rectified and that all reviews would be checked in future. Some of the reviews were duplicated and attributed to the wrong author. We therefore considered they were not genuine. For that reason we concluded the ads were misleading and had breached the Code. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.45 (Endorsements and Testimonials). The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health, and required that only health claims authorised on the applicable register, which in this case was the GB NHC Register, were permitted in marketing communications for foods. The Code also required that general health claims, which were claims that referred to the general benefits of a nutrient or food for overall good health or health-related well-being, must be accompanied by a specific authorised health claim. We first assessed which claims were specific health claims and which, therefore, must be authorised on the GB NHC Register. Ad (b) stated, “THE BEST SLEEP SUPPLEMENT ON THE MARKET” and “Are you struggling with sleep?”. We considered those were specific health claims because they implied that the supplement, and its listed ingredients – magnesium, ashwagandha and lemon balm – provided the beneficial health effect of aiding the quality of sleep. We further considered that “THE BEST SLEEP SUPPLEMENT ON THE MARKET” was a comparative specific health claim because it implied that the product was the most beneficial to sleep quality. We welcomed Tonic Health’s assurance that they had removed the claims. However, we had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that they were authorised on the GB NHC Register. The ad further stated “[…] each effervescent blends 300mg of essential magnesium, 100mg of KSM-^^ Ashwagandha, and 500mg of calming lemon balm. This powerhouse combination helps ease stress, improve sleep, and support muscle recovery so you can wake up refreshed […]”. We considered that those were specific health claims that the substances named had the beneficial effect of relieving stress, improving sleep quality and supporting muscle recovery. However, we had not seen evidence that those claims were authorised on the GB NHC Register. We then assessed which claims were general health claims, which must be accompanied by an authorised specific health claim on the GB Register. We acknowledged Tonic Health’s comments; however, the Code applied to claims that appeared in product names in the same way that it did to claims appearing elsewhere in ads. We considered the claim “Rest & Recover”, in the context of an ad for a supplement on an account for Tonic Health, would be understood as a reference to the general benefit of the supplement for overall good health and wellbeing. We considered it was therefore a general health claim for the purposes of the Code and would only be acceptable if accompanied by a relevant specific authorised health claim. Because we had not seen any evidence that the specific and comparative health claims in ad (b) were authorised on the GB Register, and because the ad made a general health claim that was not accompanied by a relevant authorised specific health claim, we therefore concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 and 15.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims) and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals).","The ads must not appear in the form complained of. We told Tonic Nutrition Ltd t/a Tonic Health to ensure that future testimonials accurately represented customer feedback. We also told them to ensure any specific health claims or comparative specific health claims made in their future advertising were authorised on the GB NHC Register and complied with the conditions of use for those claims. Additionally, any general health claims needed to be accompanied by a relevant authorised specific health claim.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/tonic-nutrition-ltd-a24-1269415-tonic-nutrition-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Trip Drink Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website for TRIP, www.drink-trip.com, a retailer of drinks infused with CBD or Magnesium, seen on 20 in December 2024, included a webpage headed “Cucumber Mint – Mindful Blend Magnesium Drink”. Images of cans appeared on a reel. Next to one image of a can, text stated “0G ADDED SUGAR”. Under the heading “How to use”, the ad stated “Try me in the morning to help find some calm before a long day, or take a TRIP to unwind when work is over”. This was alongside an image of a can accompanied by the text “95% of TRIP customers felt that Mindful BlendTM made them feel calmer”. Under “Ingredients” were listed “[…] fruit juices from concentrate (23%) (grape, apple, cucumber (2%)) [sic], magnesium citrate natural flavourings and botanical extracts (spearmint, lemon balm, chamomile, ginseng), citric acid, flavour enhancer (erythritol), natural sweetener (steviol glycosides), lion’s mane extract, ashwagandha root extract, L-theanine”. Under another heading, “Nutrition”, the ad stated, “[…] carbohydrates 2.9g (of which 2.3g naturally occurring sugars)”. Under a further heading “Studies” text stated, “Efficacy: A statistically significant decrease in the serum cortisol level appeared after (500mg) Mg supplementation, for 28 days. […] Source: http://scindeks.ceon.rs/article.aspx?artid=1452-82581403291Z&lang=en”. Further text stated, “It’s the viral ingredients everyone’s talking about, in one unique blend. Award-winning flavours, with Magnesium, Lion’s Mane, Ashwagandha and L-theanine, every refreshing drop has been crafted for calm”. The ad featured a reel of headlines which included “Magnesium is the latest buzzy supplement. Can it help with anxiety? While this mineral may not work for everyone, here’s what we know about the possible benefits”. Another headline mentioned “Health Benefits of Lion’s Mane - Reduces Anxiety and Stress”. A further headline read “Lion’s mane is all the rage for […] mental health”. Under the title “FAQs” text stated, “What is the Mindful Blend range? A […] drinks range, crafted for Calm […] with science-backed ingredients, helping you relax into your best self. What’s in the Mindful Blend? […] Magnesium, Lion’s Mane, Ashwagandha & L-theanine, at the perfect amounts to deliver a uniquely delicious, authentically functional beverage, helping you unwind into your best self […] Will it make me sleepy […] It will simply help you feel calm. How do the ingredients work […] Each ingredient works with your natural bodies’ [sic] systems in different ways, to promote feelings of calm”.","The complainant, who had professional expertise in chemistry and pharmaceutical science, challenged whether:","1. Trip Drinks Ltd t/a TRIP said that the sugars in their product were naturally occurring from fruit juices from concentrate (grape and apple), which were included for their flavour and functional attributes. They provided an extract on fruit nectars and the use of “no added sugar” in labelling from technical guidance issued by a trade association. They believed their use of the claim in their ad was consistent with that guidance. TRIP also stated that under the relevant legislation a “no added sugar” claim was permitted where the product did not contain any added mono- or disaccharides, or any other food used for its sweetening properties. They said that in accordance with that regulation, the product included the required statement, “Contains naturally occurring sugars”. TRIP explained that their formulation contained both bulk (erythritol) and intense (stevia) sweeteners. They were separately declared on the product’s pack under the text “with sweeteners”. They said that this reinforced the point that the fruit juices were not used for sweetening, but for flavour, colour, texture and mouthfeel. 2. & 3. TRIP said that they had removed the claims that the product reduced serum cortisol levels and promoted feelings of calm, and that the product could help with or reduce anxiety and stress, as a precaution while they awaited external advice. They had begun an internal audit to ensure no references remained in their advertising but hoped to be in a position to make the claims in the future.","The CAP Code required that only nutrition claims authorised on the Great Britain Nutrition and Health Claims Register (the GB Register) were permitted in marketing communications. The Code defined a nutrition claim as any claim which stated, suggested or implied that a food (or drink) had particular beneficial nutritional properties due to the amount of calories, nutrients or other substances it contained, did not contain, or contained in reduced or increased proportions. In addition, the advertiser was required to ensure that the product met the conditions of use associated with the authorised claim. The ASA considered the claim “0g added sugar” to be equivalent to “with no added sugars”, which was a permitted nutrition claim on the GB Register. The conditions of use associated with a “with no added sugars” claim permitted it to be made only where a product did not contain any added mono- or disaccharides, or any other food used for its sweetening properties. If sugars were naturally present in the food, the conditions of use required the following indication to appear on the label: “CONTAINS NATURALLY OCCURRING SUGARS”. While TRIP stated that the grape and apple juices from concentrate were for flavour, colour, texture and mouthfeel, rather than sweetening, there were naturally occurring sugars in the juices which added sugars to the product. We accepted that the ad stated “[…] carbohydrates 2.9g (of which 2.3g naturally occurring sugars)” and understood that the product was labelled as containing naturally occurring sugars. The Department of Health and Social Care’s “Nutrition and health claims: guidance to compliance with Regulation (EC) 1924/2006” stated that, where a “with no added sugars” claim was made, the question of whether any other food in the product was used for its sweetening properties needed to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. It depended on the nature of the product, why ingredients were used and how it was labelled. The guidance pointed to the name of the product as likely to indicate whether the other food was present as a defining ingredient or as a sweetener. The guidance gave the following examples. In a cranberry juice drink, the use of concentrated grape juice was usually to sweeten the product and was not included in the name. Conversely, in a mango and apple juice drink, the presence of apple juice was indicated in the name and was not added to sweeten the product. The guidance also noted that any sweetening effect was likely to be negligible with mango juice which was itself sweet. TRIP’s ad was for a cucumber and mint drink, neither of which were likely to be sweet. The fruit concentrate was from grape and apple, neither of which were in the name of the product. We acknowledged the product contained the sweeteners erythritol and stevia, and that the fruit concentrate would contribute to other aspects of the product such as colour, texture and mouthfeel. However, it would also have a sweetening effect due to the naturally occurring sugars. We therefore considered it was used, at least in part, for its sweetening properties. We therefore considered that the claim “0g added sugar” did not comply with the conditions of use associated with the equivalent “with no added sugars” nutrition claim and therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code required that only health claims authorised on the GB Register were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health. The ad implied the magnesium in the product could reduce serum cortisol levels. The ad also referred to being “crafted for calm”; claimed the product would “simply help you feel calm”; and that “Each ingredient works with your natural bodies’ [sic] systems in different ways, to promote feelings of calm”. We considered those claims were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code, because they implied that the ingredients had beneficial health effects. However, we had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that those claims were authorised on the GB Register and they therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code prohibited claims which stated or implied a food (or drink) could prevent, treat or cure human disease. We considered the claims in the ad relating to the reduction of anxiety, for example “Health Benefits of Lion’s Mane - Reduces Anxiety and Stress” would be understood by consumers as a claim to prevent, treat or cure anxiety. We further considered that in the context of the ad, the claims that the product could help with or reduce stress would also likely be understood by consumers as a reference to anxiety and its symptoms. We also considered in the context of the claims about anxiety and stress, the claim “Lion’s mane is all the rage for […] mental health” would also be understood to relate to the treatment of anxiety. We therefore concluded that the claims that the product could help to reduce stress, and the direct claim to reduce anxiety, were claims that a food could prevent, treat or cure disease which breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Trip Drinks Ltd t/a TRIP to ensure their ads did not make claims that a food or food supplement could prevent, treat or cure human disease. We also told them to ensure any nutrition claims complied with the conditions of use associated with the relevant claim on the GB Register, and that they did not use specific health claims that were not authorised on the GB Register.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/trip-drink-ltd-a25-1277097-trip-drink-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Viva!,,"A cinema ad for the vegan charity Viva!, seen in March and April 2025, featured a woman placing her sleeping baby in a cot while a lullaby played. After switching off a lamp, she turned around to see the baby in the cot. A silhouetted figure suddenly appeared standing over the cot and the room went dark. The woman switched on a light to reveal a man in a suit running a bottle of milk across the bars of the cot, which was now empty. The woman gasped and asked, “What have you done with my baby?” The man smiled, revealing misshapen, discoloured teeth, and replied in a low, gravelly voice, “You can’t keep your baby because we want your milk.” The woman’s scream was cut off and the screen went black. The next scene showed a calf in a pen. The voiceover stated, “Almost every dairy calf is taken from their mother shortly after birth so most of her milk can be sold to us. And what do you think happens to thousands of male babies like this one?” The words “Dairy is Scary” and the Viva! logo appeared on a black screen accompanied by a loud, metallic noise and the sound of something falling to the floor.","The ASA received 25 complaints, including one from The Dairy Council of Northern Ireland. The complainants challenged whether the ad was irresponsible, distressing, especially to those that had lost a child, and likely to cause serious or widespread offence.","Viva! said they aimed to raise awareness of standard practices in the dairy industry, particularly the removal of calves from their mothers shortly after birth. The ad was based on factual information and was intended to inform and encourage ethical choices, not to shock. They cited a survey which found that 59% of respondents did not know that cows must give birth in order to produce milk. Viva! said the ad used metaphor and cinematic techniques, rather than graphic imagery, to draw a symbolic comparison between human and animal separation. The character of the “bogeyman” was a dramatic device used to prompt empathy. They said it was not intended to trivialise human grief or cause distress to those who had experienced child loss. They explained that, although the ad was deemed suitable for audiences over the age of 15, it was mainly shown alongside horror, sci-fi and thriller films, where viewers would typically expect intense or disturbing content. They believed that while the ad may have made some viewers uncomfortable, that did not amount to a breach of the Code. The Cinema Advertising Association (CAA) confirmed that the ad carried an age restriction for 15-rated films and above. They said they had received six direct complaints. Due to Viva!’s registered charity status the ad was also classified by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) under their own guidelines and was issued a “15” certificate. The CAA said their panel considered the ad was likely to distress some viewers, particularly younger audiences. However, they believed the use of horror tropes, such as the shadowy figure by the cot, was within the guidelines for the equivalent film age rating and comparable to content found in horror films. They said the ad used metaphor to make an emotional connection with the audience and was restrained in tone. The brief distress shown by the mother was clearly intended as an analogy for the separation of calves from their mothers. The baby was not shown being touched or taken from the mother by the shadowy figure, nor was it portrayed as being in distress. While they acknowledged that some viewers might be affected by the appearance of the “bogeyman” and that those with personal experience of infant loss might find the imagery distressing, they believed that did not override Viva!’s right to communicate their message.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers, and must not cause serious or widespread offence, fear or distress without justifiable reason. The fear or distress should not be excessive, and marketers must not use a shocking claim or image merely to attract attention. The ad, which drew on conventions of horror films, was classified as suitable for audiences aged 15+ and appeared in cinemas. The ASA acknowledged that it was surreal and stylised in tone and did not feature graphic imagery. We understood that the approach was intended to encourage viewers to draw a direct emotional parallel between the separation of calves from their mothers and the imagined loss of a human baby. We considered, however, that while viewers would understand that the ad aimed to raise awareness of animal welfare, the nature of that comparison was likely to be seen as insensitive by many and in particular by those with experience of loss or trauma around parenthood. The domestic scene of a mother putting her baby to bed abruptly changed with the arrival of a menacing “bogeyman” figure standing over the baby’s cot, and the baby’s subsequent disappearance. We considered that the bogeyman character created a strong sense of unease and threat. Although the ad did not depict the baby being harmed, and it was not shown being physically removed, we considered that its disappearance was likely to be seen as shocking and unsettling. We further considered that the statement “You can’t keep your baby”, in combination with the sudden disappearance of the baby, was likely to be particularly upsetting for viewers with experience of child loss or fertility issues, in particular because the parallel with dairy industry practices was revealed only in the latter half of the ad. We considered that the late reveal, in combination with the unsettling imagery, was likely to increase the emotional impact and amplify distress. We considered that the message of the ad did not justify the distress likely to be caused by the approach, in particular to vulnerable audiences. For those reasons, we concluded that the ad was irresponsible and likely to cause unjustified distress and serious and widespread offence. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), and 4.1 and 4.2 (Harm and offence).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Viva! to ensure that future ads were prepared responsibly and did not contain content that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence or unjustified distress to viewers.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/viva--g25-1285745-viva-.html
ASA Ruling on Chequp Health Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on prescription-only medicines (POMs) used for weight loss. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Meta ad for CheqUp, seen on 2 October 2024, stated, “CheqUp weight loss […] Take the first step to sustainable weight loss with CheqUp […] The UK’s most effective weight loss treatment […] Weight Loss Treatment from £37.25/week […] No GP or pharmacy visit, just a 2 minute online consultation […]”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it promoted POMs to the public.,"CheqUp Health Ltd believed the ad had been created in line with what had become widespread industry practice in the weight loss sector. Upon being made aware of the complaint, they had reviewed their advertising practices and implemented several measures, including the withdrawal of all current ads from Meta platforms, the removal of the landing page identified in the complaint, an internal audit of all marketing materials, additional compliance training for members of the marketing team, and a new sign-off process involving senior members of staff. They also assured the ASA that the ad would not appear again.","The CAP Code stated that POMs (prescription-only medicines) or prescription-only medical treatments must not be advertised to the public. The ad stated that consumers would not need to visit a GP or pharmacy and included multiple references to “weight loss treatment”. While the ad did not contain a direct reference to a POM, it linked to a landing page which prominently featured an image of a medical injection pen with the word Mounjaro on it, and accompanying headline text which stated, “Mounjaro Weight Loss Injections”, under which further text stated, “Lose up to 25% of your body weight […] Weekly injection that supresses appetite and reduces cravings”. The ASA understood that all injectable forms of weight-loss medication, including Mounjaro, were POMs. A heading further down the page stated “Mounjaro information” and included several questions and answers about what Mounjaro was, how it was used and the results that could be expected. Although the landing page featured text stating, “1. Check your eligibility” and referred to a 2-minute online consultation, it also featured text next to that which stated, “2. Choose treatment. Select from our recommended UK-licensed weight loss pens”. Because of that, and the fact that the landing page did not feature any other weight-loss treatments, we considered that there was a clear implication that Mounjaro or another weight-loss injectable pen, which were all POMs, would be the outcome of the online consultation. We therefore considered the ad promoted POMs to the public. We sought advice from the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). They expressed concern that the proactive provision of a direct link to a webpage or landing page that did not require any searching from the consumer to access that information (i.e., “Mounjaro”) could be analogous to that of a website homepage. MHRA guidance for providers offering medicinal treatment services outlined that homepages should focus on medical conditions and the service provided and should not include any reference to named POMs. We welcomed CheqUp’s removal of the ad and landing page, and their assurances regarding future compliance with the Code. However, for the above reasons, we considered that the ad had advertised POMs to the public and concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Chequp Health Ltd t/a CheqUp not to promote POMs to the public in future.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/chequp-health-ltd-a24-1264775-chequp-health-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Detox Today,"One point was investigated and resolved informally with the advertiser’s agreement to make changes. The homepage would be amended to not imply Detox Today were the only treatment provider to be insured, have treatment liability and be disclosure certified.","The website homepage, www.detoxtoday.co.uk, for Detox Today, an alcohol addiction help and support service, seen in March 2025. The website included the claims: “Medical & Psychological Addiction Treatments. We offer alcohol addiction recovery services including addiction advice, how to get well, what to do for family members, medical assessments, interventions, home alcohol detox plans, online alcoholism counselling, sober coaching and sobriety maintenance services including abstinence medications”; “Organise Medical Treatments”; “We know that relapse can be part of the recovery journey, and we provide medical support to secondary and tertiary rehab units, and supported accommodation housing”; “Remote alcohol home detox service including addiction assessment, doctor consultation and prescription medications”; “We have a range of medical treatments to support abstinence and recovery including disulfiram, campral & naltrexone”; and “We provide life-saving alcohol detox, alcohol rehab, counselling and sober services in the UK. Our medical and therapeutic teams are here to provide first-class addiction treatment to help individuals, families and organisations”. The Alcohol Detox at Home Treatment page also said. “Once the initial call and assessment is complete, we arrange a client call with our doctor”.","The complainant, a director of a drug and alcohol treatment charity, challenged whether the ad implied that the marketer provided registered medical treatment and therefore was misleading.","Detox Today explained that as the result of contact from a separate organisation, changes had already been made to the website. They explained that Detox Today was staffed by one individual and offered remote private treatments to help people stop drinking. They offered therapy either in the context of home detox or independent of that. Those services did not need to be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered. Regarding the home detox service, they explained there were two main elements. The first would be the need for a doctor to prescribe medication and supervise the detox. They said they would put the client in contact with the doctor (who would be private but have the necessary registration) and any ongoing medical needs would be supervised by the doctor. Detox Today’s role would then be to provide therapy and support alongside the medical treatment. Detox Today said they had no involvement with residential rehabs which had to be CQC registered. They said they were willing to make further changes to the website if necessary.","The CAP Code stated marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so. The ASA noted that the Detox Today website did list the services offered by the advertiser, such as “in-person counselling, therapy, sober coaching & recovery support” and “Home detox for alcohol”. However, it also talked about “medical assessments”, “Medical Treatments” and “doctor consultation and prescription medications” (in the context of home alcohol detox). The website further named specific medications such as “disulfiram, campral & naltrexone” and “provide medical services”. They also used the term “our” when discussing medical and therapeutic teams and doctors, implying that such registered medical professionals were on the staff of Detox Today. We understood Detox Today offered a range of services to consumers, including therapy and advice for alcohol addiction, and that the services they offered did not require them to be registered with the CQC. However, we further understood that Detox Today did work alongside registered medical professionals, such as GPs and psychiatrists, for instance in providing home detoxes. In such circumstances the roles by Detox Today and the registered professional, while complimentary, were completely separate. The doctor saw to the medical needs of the individual, by prescribing medication and assessing them medically, and Detox Today provided therapy or counselling around the individual’s alcohol addiction. Taken as a whole, we considered that the website did not make a clear delineation between the services offered directly by Detox Today and those performed by third-party professionals. As a consequence, we considered consumers were likely to understand that Detox Today directly provided medical services and had medically qualified staff. The implication of claiming to offer such services was therefore that Detox Today had CQC registration; however, that was not the case. We concluded therefore that the website was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 3.1 (Misleading advertising).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Detox Today to ensure that their advertising did not imply that they employed staff who provided services where they needed to be CQC registered, if they did not.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/detox-today.html
ASA Ruling on Express Healthcare Ltd t/a pharmacyonline.co.uk,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on weight loss prescription-only medicines (POMs). The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Google search ad for pharmacyonline.co.uk, seen on 19 December 2024, featured text stating ""Obesity Treatment Jab"" and an image of a hand holding a package that had an image of a vial of liquid on the front.",The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it promoted POMs to the public.,Express Healthcare Ltd t/a pharmacyonline.co.uk did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Express Healthcare Ltd’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code stated that POMs or prescription-only medical treatments must not be advertised to the public. The ad referred to “Obesity Treatment Jab”. The ASA considered that consumers were likely to understand that to mean a weight-loss treatment that was administered by injection. We understood that all injectable forms of weight-loss medication were POMs. We therefore considered that the claim “Obesity Treatment Jab” promoted a POM to the public. We also considered that the image of a vial of liquid on the packaging shown in the ad, although unbranded, was likely to be understood by consumers to mean, in the context of an ad for weight-loss treatment, an injectable form of weight-loss medication. We therefore considered that the image of a vial of liquid also promoted POMs to the public. We sought advice from the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). They expressed concern that as weight-loss injections were legally classified as Prescription-Only Medicines, the use of terms such as “obesity treatment jab” was likely to lead to a consumer requesting a POM. For those reasons, we considered the ad promoted a POM to the public and concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Glamour Shots,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Google search ad for eBay seen on 8 March 2025 included a full-length image of a woman with a very large bust, wearing a top which exposed most of her breasts. Text underneath stated, “A21 Voluptuous Busty model…”, followed by pricing information and the text “eBay” and “By Genie”. The ad was displayed in a carousel of results delivered following a Google search for “eBay UK”.","The complainant, who believed the ad sexually objectified women, challenged whether the ad was:","Glamour Shots did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries. Genie Ventures Ltd t/a Genie confirmed that they acted as an affiliate marketing partner of eBay, promoting products via Google Shopping based on product feeds provided by eBay. They stated that, because of the high number of products in eBay’s catalogue, ad selection was fully automated and was not reviewed manually. Because of that, the ad was inadvertently shown. They accepted that the ad breached CAP Code rules on harm and offence, acknowledging that its imagery and language were inappropriate and likely to cause offence. They emphasised that the ad was not manually chosen, nor intentionally featured, but accepted responsibility for the failure. They also agreed that the ad did not meet the standards of social responsibility as it appeared in an untargeted environment without appropriate safeguards. Genie said they welcomed the ASA’s guidance and in response to the complaint, had taken several actions, which included a full audit of their product filtering and ad-serving systems, the introduction of updated filters to block sexually explicit or adult content, and a broader process review to introduce additional automated and manual controls. Google Ireland Ltd stated that it was Genie’s responsibility to abide by applicable laws and regulations, including the CAP Code under the terms they agreed to. They stated that all shopping ads must comply with the general Google ad policies and the specific shopping ad policies, including in relation to “Adult content” and “Non-family safe” content. They stated that Google did not show shopping ads containing permissible “Adult content” on its general search results pages, but may show Shopping ads containing permissible “Non-family safe” content if the user had SafeSearch turned off.","The ASA was concerned by Glamour Shots' lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The ad depicted a woman bending over in a pose that emphasised her breasts, to the extent that her chest was almost fully exposed. The ASA therefore considered she was depicted in a manner that was sexually suggestive and that her body was made the central focus of the ad. We considered that the description “A21 Voluptuous, busty model” further drew attention to the model’s chest which added to that overall impression. In addition, we considered that description had the effect of anonymising the model and invited viewers to view her body as a sexual object. We therefore concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious offence and included a gender stereotype in a way that was likely to cause harm. We understood the ad appeared as part of a carousel of paid search results without any targeting restrictions following a Google search for “eBay UK” on the internet browser of a mobile device. The search term used was general and unrelated to adult content. The ad was therefore likely to have been seen by a broad audience, including children. We therefore considered, in addition to the ad including a gender stereotype that was likely to cause harm, that the ad had been irresponsibly targeted because it was sexually suggestive. Because we considered that this specific ad was likely to cause serious offence and included a gender stereotype in a way that was likely to cause harm, it was not suitable to be featured in any paid-for search ad. While we acknowledged the ad was for a photo that featured sexually suggestive content, we considered the advertiser must ensure that their ads did not feature content which was likely to cause offence or harm. On points 1 and 2, we concluded the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 (Harm and offence), and 4.9 (Gender stereotypes).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Glamour Shots to ensure their ads were prepared responsibly in the future and did not sexualise and objectify women. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/glamour-shots-a25-1287166-glamour-shots.html
ASA Ruling on Hexpress Healthcare Ltd t/a HealthExpress.co.uk,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on prescription-only medicines (POMs) used for weight loss. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Meta ad for HealthExpress.co.uk, seen on 2 October 2024, stated, “Access Clinically Proven Weight Loss Treatments After Completing a Quick Online Consultation.” The ad included an image of a partially visible “he” branded injection pen. Text in the image stated, “UNLOCK THE POWER OF ONCE-A-WEEK CLINICALLY BACKED WEIGHTLOSS TREATMENT 10% OFF CODE: NEWAP10”. Text underneath the image stated, “10% Off with Code NEWAP10 Treatments starts from £139.50 per pen” with a button labelled “Lean More”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it promoted POMs to the public.,"Hexpress Healthcare Ltd t/a HealthExpress.co.uk said they removed the ad in late October, prior to the launch of the ASA’s investigation. They said they provided a consultation model, and their team of doctors, who were all General Medical Council (GMC) registered, administered prescriptions, and they did not use pharmacist prescribers. They said patients required a consultation with one of their doctors before medicine was prescribed or dispensed. They said they only aimed to promote their clinical consultation service rather than any medicinal products. They explained that they occasionally offered website wide discounts, which were applied to their doctors’ consultation services rather than any medication. They said the promotion in the ad was not designed to highlight or promote any particular POMs.","The CAP Code stated that POMs (prescription-only medicines) or prescription-only medical treatments must not be advertised to the public. The ad contained a partial image of a medical injection pen, branded with the “he” (HealthExpress.co.uk) logo. The ASA considered that although the image featured only part of the pen and logo, the image would still have been understood by consumers to reference a weight-loss injection pen. We also considered the text “Treatments starts from £139.50 per pen” would have further led consumers to understand that the image referred to a medical injection pen, used for weight-loss. We understood that all injectable forms of weight-loss medication were POMs. We sought advice from the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). They expressed concern that as weight-loss injections (described as “pen” in relation to the weight-loss treatment) were legally classified as a POM, the use of those terms was likely to lead to a consumer requesting a POM. Therefore, we considered the partial image of the injection pen in that context promoted a POM to the public. We also considered the claim “ONCE-A-WEEK CLINICALLY BACKED WEIGHT LOSS TREATMENT” was likely to be understood by consumers to mean injectable weight-loss POMs, such as Wegovy (semaglutide), which were typically injected weekly, as opposed to other medical weight-loss treatments, such as the non-POM Orlistat, which was typically taken orally in tablet form, three times a day. The ad linked to a landing page on the HealthExpress website that featured in a prominent position at the top of the page, images of Wegovy (semagultide) packaging, that prominently stated, “once weekly” on the boxes. The landing page did not feature any non-POM options and whilst there was a reference to a consultation further down the page, there was no indication that any treatment other than Wegovy would be the outcome of a consultation. Therefore, we also considered the reference to “ONCE-A-WEEK […] weight loss treatment” in the ad, promoted a POM to the public. We also considered Chapter seven of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s (MHRA) The Blue Guide, which stated that information provided about POMs had to be factual and non-promotional. The ad contained a 10% discount with the discount code “NEWAP10”, but did not mention specific products. The landing page of the website, linked to from the ad, also stated, “10% Off with the code ‘NEWAP10’ Only applicable on starting dosage” next to the images of Wegovy (semaglutide) packaging. We considered that consumers would understand that the discount stated in the ad applied directly to Wegovy (semaglutide). We therefore considered the discount code and price in the ad to be a promotional price for a POM and that aspect of the ad also promoted POMs to the public. The MHRA also expressed concern that the proactive provision of a direct link to a webpage or landing page that did not require any searching from the consumer to access that information could have been analogous to that of a website homepage. MHRA guidance for treatment service providers outlined that homepages should focus on medical conditions and the service provided, and should not include any reference to named POMs. For those reasons, we considered that the ad advertised POMs to the public and concluded that it breached the Code.The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Hexpress Healthcare Ltd t/a HealthExpress.co.uk not to promote POMs to the public in future.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/hexpress-healthcare-ltd-a24-1264776-hexpress-healthcare-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Juniper Technologies UK Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on prescription-only medicines (POMs) used for weight loss. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Google search ad for Juniper UK, seen on 30 August 2024, stated “GLP-1 Weekly Weight Loss Injection” and featured an image of an injection pen.",The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it promoted POMs to the public.,"Juniper Technologies UK Ltd t/a Juniper UK said they had removed the ad in early September, prior to the launch of the ASA’s investigation, following an internal review. The landing page on their website, which referred to Wegovy weight-loss injections, which was accessed from the ad, was not linked to other ads so had become inaccessible from that date. They believed that the discount on the landing page of their website which was accessed from the ad should not be construed as the promotion of a POM as it applied to the cost of the Juniper programme, which included coaching, their app and access to community services, and not the medicine alone. They also said that their programme offered both POMs and over-the-counter (OTC) medications. They also said that they had updated their compliance processes.","The CAP Code stated that POMs or prescription-only medical treatments must not be advertised to the public. The ad referred to “GLP-1”, “Weight Loss Injection”, a price claim “£135” and contained an image of a plain white unbranded medical injection pen. The ASA understood that GLP-1 (Glucagon-like peptide-1) was a class of POMs, and that consumers would likely understand GLP-1 as reference to a class of POMs used for weight loss. Therefore, we considered the reference to “GLP-1” in the ad promoted POMs to the public. We understood that all injectable forms of weight-loss medication were POMs. The ad contained an image of an unbranded medical injection pen. Although the pen did not feature the name of a POM, we considered that the image of an injection pen, in the context of an ad for weight-loss treatment, would be understood by consumers to mean a POM. Therefore, we considered the image of the unbranded injection pen, promoted a POM to the public. Similarly, we considered that consumers would have understood the reference to “Weight Loss Injection” as a reference to a POM. Therefore, the claim “Weight Loss Injection” also promoted a POM to the public. The price in the ad was £135. The website landing page, to which the ad linked, featured Wegovy, both of which were injectable weight-loss POMs containing semaglutide, and contained a discount code, which reduced the price from £189 to £135 a month. We acknowledged that Juniper UK said the medicine was part of an overall programme, which included non-medicinal services, and OTC medicines. However, the landing page contained a pricing guide, which provided the price per dosage of Wegovy, and did not refer to any other treatments for weight loss. The price for “Dosage 1” was “£189 (0.25mg)” and this section explained that the cost of the Weight Reset Programme varied depending on the medication and dosage prescribed. Therefore, we considered that consumers would understand the £189 price for Dosage 1 of Wegovy, which was being offered at the discounted price for £135 as the price for treatment, which specifically included Wegovy, and not an OTC medicine. Therefore, we considered the discounted “£135” price in the ad, was a promotional price for a POM and promoted POMs to the general public. We sought advice from the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). They expressed concern that as weight-loss injections and GLP-1s were legally classified as POMs, the use of those terms was likely to lead to a consumer requesting a POM. We acknowledged that Juniper UK had removed the ad. However, because at the time the ad appeared, it advertised a POM to the public, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on MyFlowers Ltd t/a MyFlowers,"On 6 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 6 April 2025, the ASA considered the ads and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 6 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code .","A paid-for Google search ad and a website for MyFlowers, seen on 28 March 2025: a. The paid-for Google search ad stated, “Flowers Harrogate – Flowers in 3 Hours – myflowers.co.uk”. Further text stated, “Same-day & Free Next-day Flower Delivery”. b. The website homepage, myflowers.co.uk, featured the text “Free UK delivery from 3 hours”. A product listing included a graphic near the top of the page, underneath the product’s price and a “Send now” button, which stated, “Delivery in 3 hours from the moment you order”. Further down the page, underneath a list of “Recently Viewed” items, and product reviews, under the heading “Details”, text stated, “Please note, the selected arrangement is available for Same-Day delivery only within London”.","The complainant, who understood that same-day delivery only applied to London, challenged whether the ads were misleading.","MyFlowers Ltd said that they planned to implement changes to their ads and their website to make clear that delivery within three hours from the moment a consumer made a purchase was only possible in selected locations. In relation to ad (b), they said that they would ensure that any significant limitations were clearly communicated when relevant.","The ASA considered consumers would understand from the claim “flowers in 3 hours” in ad (a) that flowers could be delivered within three hours in Harrogate from the moment a consumer made a purchase. In addition, we considered the claim “Same-day & Free Next-day Flower Delivery” would be understood by consumers to mean that same-day and free next-day delivery of flowers was also available in Harrogate. However, we understood that was not the case, because same-day delivery was only available in London. We further considered consumers would understand the claims “Free UK delivery from 3 hours” and “Delivery in 3 hours from the moment you order” in ad (b) to mean that delivery was available within three hours to UK addresses without exception. We acknowledged that text further down the product listing page stated, “the selected arrangement is available for Same-Day delivery only within London”. However, that text was only viewable by scrolling down, and it was possible to proceed to purchase without seeing the text. We considered that qualification was not sufficiently prominent, and in any case, contradicted the claim in the ad, because it had made direct reference to delivery within three hours being possible across the country. We acknowledged that MyFlowers stated they would make changes to their ads, such as by replacing “same-day delivery” in regional ads with “fast delivery” and adding clarification that delivery from 3 hours was only possible in selected areas. However, at the time the ads appeared, they implied that same-day delivery and delivery within three hours was available in all UK locations when this was not the case. We therefore concluded that the ads were misleading and breached the Code. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising) and 3.9 (Qualifications).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told MyFlowers Ltd to ensure that future ads did not state or imply that same-day delivery was available in all instances, or for all UK addresses, if that was not the case.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/myflowers-ltd-a25-1285210-myflowers-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Nipper&Co Ltd t/a Nipper & Co,,"A paid-for Facebook ad for Nipper&Co, a herbal health company, seen on 23 March 2025 promoted their “MUM’S MiLK [sic]” lactation tea. Text in the caption stated, “Our 100% natural lactation tea is made with powerful botanicals [leaf emoji] to encourage breast milk supply and postpartum hormonal balance. It’s helped 1000s of mums on their feeding journey […]”. The ad also featured a video which began by focusing in on the product’s packaging, with overlaid text that stated, “Let’s see what a week of Nipper & Co’s lactation tea does”. The video showed two breast pump bottles, both containing milk, while text stated, “day 1: […]” then showed a person pouring milk into a storage bag with measurements on it, while the text “Morning pump 2oz” appeared. The video then cut to a cup of herbal tea brewing, and back to a person holding a breast pump bottle up to the camera, and overlay text that stated, “7 days of daily tea = 3oz daytime pump” as the person then poured milk into another storage measuring bag, and added it to a pile of similarly filled bags.",The complainant challenged whether the ad included health claims that were in breach of the Code.,"Nipper&Co Ltd t/a Nipper & Co said they had removed the ad and that it would not appear again in the same form. They said they were fully committed to ensuring compliance and avoiding any potentially misleading messaging, and had taken steps internally, including reviewing their process and tightening up controls with their creative partners, to ensure they adhered to the CAP Code in future.","The CAP Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied that a relationship existed between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health. Only specific health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims Register (the GB NHC Register) could be made in ads promoting food or drink products. The ASA considered the claim that the tea was “made with powerful botanicals to encourage breast milk supply” stated a relationship between the drink and the production of breast milk in new mothers. We considered that the references to the product’s name, “lactation tea” in the ad, also implied a relationship between the tea and breast milk production. We further considered the video content, which appeared to show someone producing 2oz of breast milk whilst pumping on day one of consuming the tea, which increased to 3oz on day seven of consuming the tea, also implied that the MUM’s MiLK lactation tea could increase how much breast milk a new mother could produce. We considered those were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code. However, we had not seen any evidence which demonstrated that those claims were authorised on the GB NHC Register. We welcomed Nipper & Co’s action to remove the ad. However, because at the time it was seen it included specific health claims that were not authorised on the GB NHC Register, we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1 and 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims)",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Nipper&Co Ltd t/a Nipper & Co to ensure that any specific health claims made in their future advertising were authorised on the GB NHC Register and met the associated conditions of use.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/nipper-co-ltd-a25-1284063-nipper-co-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on PepsiCo International Ltd t/a Lipton Tea,,"Two posts on Instagram and TikTok by Lipton Ice Tea, seen on 18 March 2025. a. The Instagram post contained an image of a can of Peach Lipton Ice Tea with white wings attached, and text that stated, “REST IN PEACH You may have heard that our iconic Peach Lipton Ice Tea flavour is getting discontinued. We know – it hurts (sorry if we’ve ruined your go-to afternoon chill bev). But don’t worry, the rest of your faves are still here to keep you refreshed. And who knows? Maybe one day, Peach will make a legendary comeback. We appreciate your understanding during this period of adjustment and apologize for any inconvenience caused. #RIPeach”. A caption in the post stated. “who’s joining my peach support group? #RIPeach #liptonicetea”. b. The TikTok post contained the same image and text as ad (a).","The complainants, who had believed the peach flavour was being discontinued only to find out the following day that it was an April Fool’s joke and the flavour was not being discontinued, challenged whether the ads were misleading.","PepsiCo International Ltd t/a Lipton Tea said the ad campaign was intended as a light-hearted April Fools’ joke, and that the suggestion that the product would be discontinued was not meant to be taken seriously. They believed the ad would be understood as a joke, that the peach flavour was one of their best-selling products and it was not their intention to mislead consumers.They believed the tone of the ad was playful, and said the content, such as the title “Rest in Peach” was designed to convey humour. They also said the text “maybe one day peach will make a legendary comeback” hinted towards the post being a joke. They said the ads were limited to organic posts on their social media channels, and that many of their followers understood the ad as a joke, as displayed by comments on the posts, including the top comment, which had 60.3 thousand likes, which said, “THIS BETTER BE A JOKE” and other comments that referenced it was likely a marketing campaign. They highlighted that these comments would have had high visibility due to them getting a large number of likes, and would have been high up in the comments section. They had initially planned to reveal the Joke on 1 April 2025, but in response to some negative comments received from consumers, took prompt action by publishing a follow-up post the next day on 19 March 2025, to confirm it was a prank. They believed those actions helped mitigate any misunderstanding and demonstrated their responsiveness to reassure consumers. They said the post was made prior to 1 April to avoid getting lost amongst other brands’ April Fools’ ads, and not to mislead consumers. They said they would learn from these ads and ensure their future campaigns of a similar nature would be more clearly signposted and more carefully timed to avoid misinterpretation.","The ads featured statements such as “our iconic Peach Lipton Ice Tea flavour is getting discontinued” and “We […] apologize [sic] for any inconvenience caused”, which the ASA considered were likely to be understood by consumers to mean the tea was being discontinued. We considered that consumers would likely understand that, because it was being discontinued, there would be a limited amount of time to purchase a peach flavour tea product before stocks ran out, and if they wanted to purchase the product, there would be a time pressure to do so. We understood, however, that the product was not being discontinued. We acknowledged that the advertiser had intended the campaign to be a light-hearted April Fools’ joke, though the ads were posted two weeks prior to April Fools’ Day rather than on the day itself when consumers might typically expect to see April Fools’ jokes. While some of the comments in the posts indicated that some people believed it was a joke that the product was being discontinued, the comments came from consumers, not Lipton Ice Tea, and were not part of the ads. We also noted that the comment section featured comments which suggested consumers were unclear on whether or not the ad was a joke, or serious. We recognised that the ads featured some elements of humour, such as the image of the can with wings, the “REST IN PEACH” headline and “RIPeach” text, but considered those elements were not sufficient to make it clear that the statements about discontinuation were a joke. Therefore, given the timing of the ads and the lack of clear context to explain or suggest that the ads were a joke, we considered they gave the overall impression that the product was being discontinued, when that was not the case, which was likely to affect consumers’ decisions in relation to whether, and in what quantities, to purchase the product. For those reasons, we concluded that the ads were misleading. We welcomed Lipton Tea’s comments that they would ensure future campaigns of a similar nature were clearly signposted as being a joke. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Lipton Tea to ensure their future advertising did not misleadingly give the impression that their products were being discontinued, if that was not the case.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/pepsico-international-ltd-g25-1284970-pepsico-international-ltd.html

The ad portrayed a fictional conversation between friends, one of whom said they were nervous about trying “those new weight loss treatments”, to which the other told her not to be, and to “get them from Cloud Pharmacy”, also stating that they were “cheap” and did not tie users to a subscription.

The website landing page to which the ad linked heavily featured Wegovy and Mounjaro and contained the same discounted price of £129. We acknowledged that Phlo said the medication was part of an overall programme, which included non-medical services. However, the only treatment referred to on the landing page was injectable weight-loss medication and we considered that consumers would understand the £129 price to be the discounted price for a POM. We therefore considered that due to the context of the landing page, consumers would have understood the “£129” price in the Google ad to be a promotional price for a POM and therefore also promoted POMs to the public. For those reasons, we considered that the ad advertised POMs to the public and concluded that it breached the Code.The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Phlo Technologies Ltd t/a Phlo Clinic,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on prescription-only medicines (POMs) used for weight loss. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Google search ad for Phlo Clinic, seen on 2 December 2024, included text that stated, “Weight loss Injections”.",The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it promoted POMs to the public.,"Phlo Technologies Ltd t/a Phlo Clinic said their telehealth service included a consultation with qualified healthcare professionals, educational resources to empower patient decision-making and treatment options, including both only POM and non-POM items (which were available only when clinically appropriate and following consultation). They believed the marketing of their service was compliant with the guidelines issued by the GPhC (General Pharmaceutical Council) and MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) and did not promote POMs to the public. They acknowledged that the claim “Weight Loss Injection” could have been misinterpreted as promoting POMs. They said the ad had been dynamically generated and used Google Ads Dynamic Search Ad (DSA) to automatically generate the ad’s headline and description, based on the user’s search term. That had inadvertently resulted in the use of the claim 'Weight Loss Injections' appearing in the text. They said the ad and all associated ads using the DSA format were removed from circulation in December 2024 prior to the start of the ASA’s investigation. They further said that they had implemented advertising changes and updated their advertising strategy, to include a tighter internal review process to ensure all materials aligned with both ASA and regulatory guidelines. Google said DSAs were a type of ‘Google Ads’ campaign which used an advertiser’s website content to target their ads. They said that headlines and landing pages of DSAs were generated using content from the advertiser’s website, and advertisers chose whether or not to use DSAs. They further said that the ad did not comply with their policies, and that the ad had been removed after they were notified of the investigation.","The CAP Code stated that prescription-only medicines (POMs) or prescription-only medical treatments must not be advertised to the public.

ASA Ruling on SemaPen Ltd,"This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on prescription-only medicines (POMs) used for weight loss. The ads were identified for investigation following intelligence gathering by our Active Ad Monitoring system, which uses AI to proactively search for online ads that might break the rules.","A paid-for Google ad for SemaPen, seen on 2 October 2024, stated, “SemaPen Weight Loss […] Clinically Designed Weight Loss Pen Program […] SemaPen Makes Weight Loss Easier.”",The ASA challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it promoted POMs to the public.,"SemaPen Ltd said they had initiated an internal review upon being made aware of the complaint. They accepted that the ad in question had not been compliant with the requirements of ASA guidance or the CAP Code. They said they had contracted with a third-party marketing agency and had not realised that the content in question had not been compliant. They said they had shared guidelines issued by the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) with the agency at the start of their relationship and had expected that all ads would meet those requirements. SemaPen accepted that they bore the responsibility for their marketing material’s overall compliance and said they had since stopped working with the third-party agency. They had ensured the new agency they were partnering with were aware of the legal and regulatory requirements around the advertising of POMs and had also re-shared MHRA guidance internally. SemaPen said that they were not affiliated with non-specialist prescribers (e.g., GPs), but that they hoped in future to work with the NHS as they grew as a business. They said their website and onboarding process made clear to all patients that not everyone was suitable for prescription-only weight-loss medication, and that patients underwent a thorough medical assessment and triage prior to any prescription being issued. SemaPen said they were happy to work with the ASA on such issues and would ensure that future marketing materials would be compliant.","The CAP Code stated that prescription-only medicines (POMs) or prescription-only medical treatments must not be advertised to the public. The ad included multiple references to the brand name “SemaPen” and the claims “Clinically Designed Weight Loss Pen Program” and “SemaPen Makes Weight Loss Easier”. The ASA considered that the reference to “Weight Loss Pen” was likely to be understood by consumers to mean injectable weight-loss medication. We noted that the landing page on SemaPen’s website which was linked to by the ad stated, “What’s included? Weight Loss Injections […] One of the first providers of weight loss jabs in the UK, we offer this ground breaking [sic] injectable treatment”, next to which was a graphic of a medical injection pen. We understood that all injectable forms of weight-loss medication were POMs. We therefore considered that the reference to “Weight Loss Pen” in the ad promoted a POM to the public. Furthermore, “SemaPen” the brand name of the product, which was referenced in the ad, was made up of a combination of the terms “Sema” and “Pen”. We considered that, in the context of an ad for a weight-loss treatment, consumers would be likely to understand the reference to “Sema” to be an abbreviated version of “semaglutide”, which was a weight-loss POM. We therefore considered that the references to “Sema” and “SemaPen” promoted a POM to the public. We sought advice from the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). They expressed concern that as weight-loss injections (“Weight Loss Pen”) were legally classified as a POM, the use of that term was likely to lead to a consumer requesting a POM. While we welcomed SemaPen’s assurances that future ads would be compliant with the requirements of the Code, for the above reasons we considered that the ad had advertised POMs to the public and concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on Yazen Health AB t/a Yazen,This Ruling forms part of a wider piece of work on prescription-only medicines (POMs) used for weight loss.,"An Instagram post by the TV personality Gemma Collins, @gemmacollins, posted on 6 January 2025, promoted the weight loss service Yazen. In a video, Ms Collins stated, “I'm starting this year two sizes down, thanks to Yazen’s weight loss app and medication. It's really quick and easy to get started with Yazen, it has absolutely changed my life […] I finally found something that actually I lose weight on. All you need to do is download the app and answer a few quick questions about your goals. Do not buy it from anyone but Yazen.” Ms Collins stated, “I feel healthier, I feel happier. I don't have that constant noise in my head ‘you need to eat, you need to eat’ […] Yes, there's, you know, reports and stuff. And I'm not telling anyone to go on this medication, but it is prescribed on the NHS.” Ms Collins then stated, “Yazen will connect you with one of their nurses who will […] complete some simple health checks and a blood test […] your Yazen doctor will use this to create your individual treatment plan and just like that, your medication will be delivered straight to your door with all the instructions on how you need to start your weight loss journey. It really is as simple as that.” Text in the accompanying caption stated, “Yazen was founded by doctors to support people struggling with obesity and weight-related issues. They use approved medication alongside support from their team of doctors, psychologists, dietitians, physiotherapists and your own Yazen Coach, helping their patients take control of their health […] I hope we can all embark on this journey together. It’s important to remember everyone’s weight loss journey is personal and unique and you can talk to your GP if you’re concerned! Visit @yazenUK to find out more. #Yazen #YazenHealth #weightlossjourney #healthylifestyle #loseweightnow”.",Two complainants challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it promoted POMs to the public.,"Yazen Health AB t/a Yazen said they were a Swedish-registered digital healthcare provider focused on treating weight issues and obesity through their digital platform, which had been developed by a specialist team of healthcare professionals. They said their method was built on clinically proven science, where every patient received a personal assessment and an individually adapted treatment plan. That plan included support from doctors, lifestyle coaches, dietitians, psychologists and physiotherapists. As part of the treatment, the doctor might prescribe relevant medication, which meant that Yazen was a digital healthcare provider, not a pharmacy. Doctors employed by Yazen might prescribe POMs as part of patient treatment if it was found to be the best option for that individual. The patient would then purchase the medication from a pharmacy of their choice. Yazen did not sell any medication, and said their business model was not dependent on prescribing such medication. Therefore, they said they had no interest in advertising POMs to the public. Yazen said the paid partnership Instagram post from 6 January had been intended to share information about their holistic, responsible approach to weight loss, and had not been intended to focus solely on medication. Following notification of the complaint, and in agreement with Gemma Collins, the post had since been amended to remove any reference to POMs. Yazen said they would ensure that future posts were compliant with the CAP Code. Gemma Collins said she took her responsibilities under the CAP code seriously and strove to comply with them. She said she had partnered with Yazen as she had historically struggled with her weight, despite trying many diets. She said she had used Yazen's for several months before deciding to go public with it, because she found the programme had worked for her. She said it was the holistic approach which had helped her and which she wanted to share primarily. She said she would have done that regardless of whether medication was recommended. She accepted that her posts had promoted the Yazen weight loss service and app. She said Yazen would in future approve any marketing materials she might post, and that she would follow any guidance the ASA provided.","The CAP Code stated that prescription-only medicines (POMs) or prescription-only medical treatments must not be advertised to the public. The ASA acknowledged that the ad did not make reference to a named POM. However, the ad did refer to “weight loss […] medication” and “it is prescribed on the NHS”. Ms Collins also stated, “Yes, there's […] reports and stuff. And I'm not telling anyone to go on this medication, but it is prescribed on the NHS” which we considered, given her tone, alluded to the recent press reports that people had suffered adverse reactions from taking injectable weight-loss medications. We also noted that a news section on Yazen’s website featured links to three newspaper articles about Ms Collins’ weight-loss journey. The thumbnails for those articles featured text explaining that Ms Collins had lost weight using Yazen’s “GLP-1 weight loss injections”. We understood that all injectable forms of weight-loss medication were POMs and that GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) were a class of POMs. We sought advice from the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). They expressed concern that consumers were likely to be led to request a POM. It was their view that this likelihood could be amplified by any resultant national newspaper coverage of Ms Collins’ experience of using a GLP-1 medicinal product for weight loss. We considered that the reference to “weight loss medication” in the ad was a reference to POMs and that the ad therefore promoted POMs to the public. For those reasons, we concluded the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Yazen Health AB t/a Yazen not to promote, either directly or indirectly, POMs to the public in future.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/yazen-health-ab-g25-1278617-yazen-health-ab.html
ASA Ruling on Cosmos Oyun Yazilim Sanayi Ticaret Ltd Sirketi t/a Filter AI,,"An in-game ad for an AI simulator app, seen on April 6 2025, featured an image of a man alongside text stating, “me”, next to an image of the singer Sabrina Carpenter alongside text stating, “My crush”. An AI simulated video showed the two kissing and text stated, “Kiss your CELEBRITY CRUSH”. A voiceover stated, “Just upload two photos to filter AI app and it will create a video of kissing your celebrity crush in seconds.” Further text stated, “Filter AI. No #1 AI Video Generator. Try with your own photo”.","The complainant, who believed that the ad objectified women, challenged whether it was offensive and promoted a harmful gender stereotype.",Cosmos Oyun Yazilim Sanayi Ticaret Ltd Sirketi t/a Filter AI said they did not intend for the ad to objectify women or to promote a harmful gender stereotype. They said the purpose of the ad was to promote their product in a creative and responsible manner. They said they would review their internal advertising guidelines and confirmed that the ad had been withdrawn.,"The CAP Code stated that ads must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, must not cause serious or widespread offence and must not include gender stereotypes that were likely to cause harm. The ad featured an AI simulated video in which a man and the singer Sabrina Carpenter were seen to kiss each other, alongside text which stated, “Kiss your celebrity crush”. That video was generated by uploading two images of individual people. The ASA considered that, within the context of the man being labelled “me” and the woman being labelled “My Crush”, the woman was portrayed as being a person who the man was physically attracted to. She was then seen kissing the man, which was her sole role in the ad. Because her only purpose in the ad was entirely focused on being a person for the man to kiss, which was an intimate act, we considered she was reduced to being presented as an object. We therefore considered the ad objectified women and featured a harmful gender stereotype. We also considered the phrase “Just upload two photos to filter AI app and it will create a video of kissing your celebrity crush in seconds” alongside images of women, was both harmful and offensive to women because it implied consumers should use the app to objectify them. We therefore considered the phrase, alongside a selection of images of women, reinforced the harmful impression that it was acceptable to objectify and stereotype women by presenting them as objects. For those reasons, we considered the ad objectified women by reducing them to physical objects. We therefore concluded that the ad included a harmful gender stereotype and was likely to cause serious offence. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Cosmos Oyun Yazilim Sanayi Ticaret Ltd Sirketi t/a Filter AI to ensure that future ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious offence, including by featuring a harmful gender stereotype that objectified women.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/cosmos-oyun-yazilim-sanayi-ticaret-ltd-sirketi.html
ASA Ruling on GTOHero Ltd t/a GTO Hero,"On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling was received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ad and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code .","A paid-for Reddit ad for GTOHero.com, a poker Real Time Assistance (RTA) app, seen on 14 January 2025. Text stated, “AI is changing poker forever [robot emoji] Don’t get left behind. Stay ahead of the game with GTO Hero’s Real Time Assistance (RTA) [bar graph emoji] Master GTO strategy, Plug leaks, and Outplay opponents using the same technology Pros rely on . [sic] Adapt or Get Crushed!”. A video demonstrated the product in use during an online poker game with other players staking dollars, as a voiceover stated, “This app gives you real time poker solutions. It tracks your game and then tells you what to do so that you can play GTO, making money from poker has never been so easy. You don't even need to download anything, and it's free to access every time it's your turn to act. The GTO solution is immediately shown so that you know what to do. And it's so easy to use. Just go to gtohero.com, share your screen and get real time GTO advice. Find out more at GTO hero com.” The ad linked to a website, GTOHero.com, that stated, “Please note it is against our terms of service to use GTO Hero during live play or in a way that breaks your contract or terms of service with a poker site”.","The complainant, who understood that use of the product was prohibited on poker sites, challenged whether the ad was misleading.","GTOHero Ltd t/a GTO Hero said their product was a service that could track a video feed of an online poker game and display the relevant GTO (Game Theory Optimal) solution. GTO solutions were a form of data that provided a strategy for how to play poker and allowed users to playback video or screen share to compare their play to the GTO in order to study the strategy. They said that looking at GTO solutions during live play did not constitute cheating because it was not deceptive, did not give an unfair advantage or interfere with the game’s integrity. While some poker sites had chosen to ban GTO as a matter of policy, that was a site-specific restriction rather than an inherent violation of the rules of poker. Therefore, it was possible to use GTO “live” in a way that was acceptable. For example, the user may have played on a poker site that allowed players to look up strategies and use their product, the user may not have been playing for real money or the user may have been playing in a simulated game against a computer. GTO Hero said their website homepage, which was the landing page for the ad, had a warning that stated not to use their service during live play or in a way that was not allowed by a specific poker site. They said in addition to that most of the ad showed their product being used on an uploaded video and was not live. Finally, nowhere in the ad did it say it could be used during live play without consequence if it was forbidden by a specific poker site.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not materially mislead or be likely to do so. In addition, marketing communications must state significant limitations and qualifications. Qualifications may clarify but must not contradict the claims that they qualify. We understood that GTO Hero was a poker app that allowed users to use RTA to automatically receive GTO solutions during live play. We also understood that the software showed where, from a video recording of a past game, a player had made a less optimal move and could therefore be used as a learning tool. We acknowledged GTO Hero’s comments that the ad showed their product being used on an uploaded video that was not live and we noted that it was possible to use it in a live setting in a way that was legitimate. For instance, in circumstances where users were not playing for money, where they were playing a computer opponent or on some poker sites that allowed the product. However, we firstly considered it was not clear the ad was an uploaded video. In addition, both the text in the body of the ad and the voiceover in the video stated “Real Time Assistance” or “real time poker solutions”. The video also appeared to show the app being used during a live game with other players staking real dollars around a table, while the voiceover stated, “[The software] gives you real time poker solutions. Tracks your games and tells you what to do, so that you can play GTO. Making money from poker has never been so easy.” We considered consumers were likely to understand the ad to mean that the app was for general use during real-life live events, on a range of platforms, where real funds were being staked. However, in contrast, we understood some poker sites had chosen to ban the use of GTO during live play, potentially resulting in users being banned from platforms and having funds confiscated. We acknowledged that the landing page for the ad had a warning not to use the service during live play or in a way that was not allowed by a poker site. However, we considered that warning, which was in small text and not displayed prominently, in any case misleadingly contradicted the impression of the ad. Because the ad presented the product as being used generally during live poker games to make money, whereas using the app on at least some poker sites during live play was not allowed, we concluded it was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.9 (Misleading advertising).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told GTOHero Ltd t/a GTO Hero to ensure that future ads did not misleadingly suggest the product could legitimately be used during live play on sites that prohibited the use of GTO solutions during live play.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/gtohero-ltd-a25-1275239-gtohero-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Good Guru Ltd t/a Protein World,,"An email from Protein World sent on 12 March 2025 included the subject heading “WPC Transformed My Life – Overcoming Anorexia”. The email included an image with large text that stated, “Winning Battle WITH ANOREXIA” and two photos of the same girl in gym wear. Text stated, “‘At 13, I battled anorexia and was nearly hospitalized. Gaining muscle felt impossible, but Protein World helped me fuel my body, rebuild strength and find a healthier relationship with food. Now I feel alive!’ – Regina, 16”. Photographs of the Protein World Whey Protein Concentrate were included and further text stated, “Recover Rebuild & Rise with WPC! 35% OFF EVERYTHING USE CODE - HERO SHOP NOW BE THE HERO OF YOUR JOURNEY”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it implied that a food could treat anorexia.,Good Guru Ltd t/a Protein World did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Good Guru Ltd t/a Protein World’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The CAP Code stated that claims to treat or cure human disease were not permitted for foods or food supplements. We considered that the claim in the subject of the email “WPC Transformed My Life – Overcoming Anorexia” and within the email, “Winning Battle WITH ANOREXIA”, seen alongside the before and after photos of the girl and her testimonial, were claims to treat or cure anorexia. The claims within the testimonial from the girl further implied that the food product, Protein World Whey Protein Concentrate (WPC), had played a significant role in her recovery from anorexia, a serious medical condition. We considered that the overall impression of the ad was that the product could help with recovery from, and therefore was a treatment for, anorexia. We therefore concluded that the ad breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Good Guru Ltd t/a Protein World to ensure that their ads did not make claims to treat anorexia or other human diseases. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/good-guru-ltd-a25-1282503-good-guru-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Kenvue UK Ltd t/a Listerine,,"A TV ad for Listerine mouthwash shown on 28 January 2025 depicted a woman in a bathroom facing a mirror about to floss her teeth. An animated donkey appeared behind her in the bath, pulling back the shower curtain. The donkey said, “Good on you. Flossing helps but why not add Listerine.” A picture of the product was then shown and the donkey and on-screen text stated, “PROVEN TO BE 5X MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FLOSS AT REDUCING PLAQUE*”. Superimposed text stated. “*Germ kill provides sustained plaque reduction above the gumline after a dental cleaning”. The woman was then shown gargling mouthwash. Then an animated image of the inside of a person’s mouth was displayed. Mouthwash was shown entering the mouth through the teeth and removing bacteria which were represented by green particles. The voiceover continued, “Listerine gets into the nooks. Into the crannies. Fight the good fight with a swish and a zing.” The woman was then shown with the mouthwash in her mouth, visibly surprised, as her cheeks expanded. Superimposed text stated, “Complete your routine – use alongside brushing and flossing”. The voiceover continued, “When you are taking on plaque, add Listerine.” The donkey appeared behind an image of the product. Superimposed text stated, “PROVEN TO BE 5X MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FLOSS AT REDUCING PLAQUE*”. Qualifying text said, “Complete your routine – use alongside brushing and flossing”.","The complainants, who believed the ad suggested mouthwash as an alternative to flossing was five times more effective, challenged whether the ad was misleading.","Kenvue UK Ltd t/a Listerine said the claim “proven to be 5x more effective than floss at reducing plaque”, which was supported by two published studies, was qualified with text that stated, “*Germ kill provides sustained plaque reduction above the gumline after a dental cleaning”. Therefore, it indicated to the viewer that the effect was on the teeth above the gumline and the ad as a whole would have been seen in that context. In contrast, floss or interdental brushes were recommended between the teeth to clean below the gumline before brushing. They said the ad did not suggest the product had an effect below the gumline and so did not suggest the product should replace floss, but encouraged people to use mouthwash alongside brushing and flossing. They explained further that tooth decay was one of the most common non-contagious diseases in the United Kingdom. It was therefore a contributing factor as to why the ad focused on germ kill and subsequent plaque reduction above the gumline. They said use of floss was also encouraged in the opening frame of the ad where the woman was shown flossing and the voiceover said, “Good on you, flossing helps but why not add Listerine?”. The ad therefore praised the woman for using floss, confirmed flossing was useful and encouraged viewers to add Listerine to their oral health routine. After that a bottle of Listerine was also shown side by side with dental floss, which was clearly labelled, reinforcing the idea that the two products should be complementary. Later on in the ad, superimposed text stated, “Complete your routine – use alongside brushing and flossing”, which they believed was prominent and held long enough for viewers to read, and the final voiceover said, “When you are taking on plaque, add Listerine”. Both again reiterated the message that Listerine should be added as part of an oral health routine, rather than replacing flossing or brushing. They said therefore multiple references were made to flossing and using Listerine alongside flossing and brushing in the 20 seconds the ad ran for, and for that reason the ad did not exaggerate the capability or performance of Listerine. They further stated that the animation of the mouth and Listerine filtering through the teeth demonstrated how mouthwash, due to it being a liquid, could reach all surfaces, including between the teeth. It further demonstrated the anti-bacterial effect of Listerine, which was proven to be 99.9%. The animation did not show food particles being dislodged from the teeth but instead showed bacteria being destroyed from the surface of the teeth and gums. They said that was clear from the green colour and spherical or rod-shaped forms, often associated with bacteria, that would not be mistaken for food or plaque, which was a film. That was especially the case because the qualifying text “*Germ kill provides sustained plaque reduction above the gumline after a dental cleaning” appeared for the duration of the scene. They also explained that the animation clearly showed the mouthwash reaching all the surfaces in the oral cavity. It would therefore not be seen as acting in the same way as floss which was used between the teeth and below the gumline. They stated that overall, the primary message of the ad was to highlight the effectiveness of Listerine in reducing plaque above the gumline. To provide context as to the extent of that benefit, a comparison versus flossing was provided. That was a specific benefit that complemented, rather than replaced, the use of dental floss. The ad emphasised the additional benefit of using Listerine as part of a comprehensive oral health routine, which included brushing and flossing. That would be understood by watching the ad in its entirety and considering it overall, rather than in isolated frames or sections. They confirmed the ad was no longer being broadcast. Clearcast said the ad, including the voiceover, made it clear that Listerine should be used as part of a routine that also included brushing and flossing and that the benefits of all three went together. Therefore, the ad did not state that dental floss should not be used and instead showed it as an important part of teeth cleaning. That was supported by wording of the ad that stated, “Flossing helps but why not add Listerine”, “complete your routine – use alongside brushing and flossing” and “when you’re taking on plaque add Listerine”. In addition, the shot of the product said “use alongside brushing and flossing”. Clearcast said they were happy with the visual representation of plaque removal in the ad, which was not shown as being below the gumline. They explained that the ad made clear that Listerine was to be used after both brushing and flossing, meaning plaque on and between the teeth had already been tackled. In addition, the ad included the claim “plaque reduction above the gumline” and at the beginning of the ad the actor was shown putting the dental floss down, therefore indicating plaque reduction below the gum line had already been completed. They said their consultant had reviewed the evidence and was satisfied that the claim “proven to be 5x more effective than floss at reducing plaque” had been substantiated. In addition, the consultant and Listerine noted that the evidence actually showed that Listerine was nine times more effective than flossing at removing plaque and so the ad underclaimed and did not exaggerate the benefit of the product. Their consultant had said that as long as the mouthwash had been used as directed in the ad, it would access all parts of the mouth and exposed teeth surfaces.","The BCAP Code stated ads must not materially mislead or be likely to do so and must not mislead by exaggerating the capability or performance of a product or service. The ASA acknowledged Listerine’s comments that the ad made frequent references to the product complementing floss, rather than replacing it, either in the voiceover or the visuals of the ad. However, some of those examples, such as the woman shown flossing and the floss shown side by side with Listerine, were fleeting, or in the case of the bottle of Listerine stating ”use alongside brushing and flossing” not clearly legible, and therefore they could have been easily missed by viewers. Other examples, such as when the voiceover stated, “… flossing helps but why not add Listerine?”, “When you are taking on plaque, add Listerine” and the on-screen text “… use alongside brushing and flossing”, were clearer. However, we noted that primary prominence was given to the claim “PROVEN TO BE 5X MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FLOSS AT REDUCING PLAQUE” in terms of the size of the text, as well as appearing in the voiceover. Therefore, we considered that the focus of the ad was on Listerine being five times more effective than floss in removing plaque and was likely to be understood by viewers as a substitute for floss, rather than as complementary. We considered the claim “PROVEN TO BE 5X MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FLOSS AT REDUCING PLAQUE” was likely to be understood in isolation to relate to plaque removal in general. However, we understood the comparison was intended to relate to the removal of plaque only above the gumline. We understood rinsing primarily acted on the surface of the mouth, although some data indicated it had an antibacterial effect below the gums, and killed bacteria that could cause plaque to develop, but did not remove plaque. In contrast, flossing was used to dislodge food particles and also manually remove plaque both below and above the gumline. We considered the qualifying text, “*Germ kill provides sustained plaque reduction above the gumline after a dental cleaning”, was relatively small compared to the headline claim and therefore easily missed or overlooked in contrast to the headline claim. In addition, we considered the wording of the qualification, referencing “Germ kill … after a dental cleaning” did not make it clear that the claim was based on plaque reduction above the gumline using Listerine after brushing versus floss when used alone with brushing. We therefore considered the qualification was insufficient to clarify the impression given by the “5X MORE EFFECTIVE” claim. The animation of Listerine entering the mouth and removing green particles was another prominent part of the ad. It showed Listerine cascading through the teeth and the voiceover stated, “Listerine gets into the nooks. Into the crannies”. We understood the green particles represented bacteria but considered the ad did not make that clear and that they could have been mistaken for plaque or food. We considered, in the context of the claim “PROVEN TO BE 5X MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FLOSS AT REDUCING PLAQUE”, the scene was likely to be understood as suggesting mouthwash acted in the same way as floss, and so was a five times more effective replacement, rather than as relating to complementary plaque removal above the gumline. We considered the ad was ambiguous, but that it was overall likely to be seen as presenting rinsing with Listerine as a superior replacement for flossing. Because we understood that was not the case, we concluded that it misleadingly exaggerated the product’s performance and therefore breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP rules 3.1 (Misleadingness), 3.10 (Qualification) and 3.12 (Exaggeration).",The ad must not be broadcast again in the form complained of. We told Kenvue UK Ltd t/a Listerine to ensure future ads did not mislead by exaggerating the capability or performance of a product.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/kenvue-uk-ltd-g25-1285500-kenvue-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on LEBOM Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A paid-for Facebook ad and a paid-for X ad for LEBOM, a sports betting app, seen in April 2025: a. The Facebook ad featured a video of internet personality Mashtag Brady talking about the LEBOM app. He said, “Today we are going to be playing LEBOM. LEBOM allows you to gamble against your friends on the Premier League. All you need to do is make your predictions on all of the weekend’s games. You put some money in the pot and then the winner takes it all, baby. It’s pretty f-[censored] genius.” The video included a demonstration of how the LEBOM app worked and showed clips of Mashtag and a group of friends with alcoholic drinks. They drank shots whilst Mashtag said, “Let’s get pissed.” The video then showed clips of Mashtag and his friends in a busy bar as he said, “We also have a forfeit for whoever comes bottom in the table on LEBOM.” A member of the group was told he had won the £200 prize pot. He and his friends were shown continuing to drink alcohol to celebrate the winner. The loser was shown stripping down to his underwear and walking through the bar. Mashtag said, “So download LEBOM and get betting with your friends. Don’t bet against the bookie, bet against the boys, that’s the best way about doing it.” b. The X ad featured a similar video with the same internet personality as ad (a). He said, “So, we are going to be playing LEBOM. LEBOM allows you to gamble against your friends instead of the bookies. It’s pretty fucking genius. Let’s go get absolutely fucked up.” The video included shortened clips from ad (a) of Mashtag and his friends drinking shots, celebrating and completing a forfeit before Mashtag said, “So download LEBOM. Don’t bet against the bookie, bet against the boys”.",Two complainants challenged whether the ads:,"LEBOM Ltd believed their betting app was different from other gambling products because it provided a shared social experience similar to a pub sweepstake or fantasy football league. They highlighted that their platform offered a number of in-built safeguards, including maximum stakes and controlled game frequency. They believed their ads, which demonstrated that they utilised a peer-based model without traditional betting odds, were socially responsible. LEBOM said they worked with content creators to present their product honestly and authentically in their ads. The clips featured in the ads were taken from an unscripted long-form YouTube video produced by the internet personality Mashtag Brady for his social media audience. They stated the tone of the video parodied a drinking game which was colloquially known as ‘Soccer Saturday’, which was consistent with Mashtag Brady’s usual social media content. They believed the references to alcohol were incidental and not part of the app’s gameplay. They explained that scenes of the ‘loser’ completing a forfeit were intended to show that there was always a loser on LEBOM. They said they featured individuals losing bets in almost all of their ads to responsibly reflect the reality of gambling. They believed that because they showed the LEBOM app being used in a realistic, relatable context, the ads were responsible. They stated that, upon notification of the ASA’s investigation, they had removed all ads which featured the phrases “Let’s get pissed” and “Let’s go get absolutely fucked up”. They had also removed an ad featuring the ‘loser’ being made to order drinks in his underwear as a forfeit.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications for gambling must be socially responsible and must not suggest gambling is a way to improve self-esteem or gain recognition or admiration.CAP’s advertising guidance on responsibility and problem gambling stated that marketing communications that portrayed a character being treated with admiration by others as a result of their gambling were likely to link gambling with improved self-esteem. The ads featured clips of a friendship group cheering for the winner of the prize pot and laughing as the loser was made to strip to his underwear as a forfeit. The winner appeared to be praised by the group, in contrast to the loser, who was mocked. Whilst we acknowledged LEBOM’s intention to portray losing as part of the reality of gambling, we considered that the ads went beyond referencing the emotion associated with losing. Instead, they showed the winner being celebrated by his friends whilst the loser was made to complete an embarrassing forfeit. That created the impression that the winner, who had had the most success gambling, was someone to be admired and the loser was someone to be looked down on. We therefore considered that the ads irresponsibly linked gambling with improved recognition or self-esteem. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1, 16.3.1 and 16.3.6 (Gambling). The CAP Code also stated that marketing communications must contain nothing that was likely to lead people to adopt styles of drinking that were unwise. For example, they should not encourage excessive drinking. The ads featured clips of an internet personality, Mashtag Brady, and a group of friends drinking alcohol whilst using the LEBOM app. We considered that, rather than being incidental to the setting, alcohol was prominently featured in the ads. The group was shown drinking alcohol as they monitored their results on the LEBOM app, and Mashtag said the phrases “Let’s get pissed” and “Let’s go get absolutely fucked up”. It was implied that all members of the group had been drinking heavily and were intoxicated. We considered those scenes encouraged excessive drinking by presenting binge drinking alcohol in a humorous manner. We also considered those same scenes presented drinking excessive alcohol as an activity that could be combined with gambling in order to improve socialising with friends, and which trivialised the risks of gambling whilst under the influence of alcohol. We considered that by portraying and encouraging excessive drinking, including within the context of gambling, the ads were irresponsible and breached the Code. On that point, the ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 18.1 (Alcohol).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told LEBOM Ltd to ensure that their future ads did not portray, condone, or encourage gambling behaviour that was socially irresponsible, or encourage excessive drinking.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/lebom-ltd-g25-1288328-lebom-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Mondelez UK Ltd t/a Cadbury,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A radio ad for Cadbury Delights, heard on 18 January 2025, stated, “Some people might describe Cadbury Delights as just another Cadbury bar. A bit samey. Very familiar. Honestly, we'd be chuffed if they did. Because Delights have that same chocolatey Cadbury taste you've had a million times before. Same soft nougat, same gooey caramel. But they're only 91 calories. So, samey is exactly what we're going for. Cadbury Delights. Same Cadbury, only 91 calories.”",,"1. Mondelez UK Ltd t/a Cadbury said that the ad was submitted to Radiocentre and was approved. They also confirmed that the ad was no longer being broadcast. Their intention with the claim “only 91 calories” was to provide factual information about the product’s calorific content per bar, rather than to make a “low energy” nutrition claim. They had conducted consumer research, including qualitative surveys and creative testing, to understand consumers’ interpretation of the ad. The research indicated that factual calorie information was a significant factor for their consumers, who appreciated knowing the calorie content of their products. The statement was created in line with Cadbury brand’s tone of voice while also providing relevant calorie information. They did not intend to give a misleading impression of the nutrition or health benefits of the product. They said that they would amend the statement in future ads to address the complainant’s concerns and ensure there was no implication of a nutritional claim. 2. They understood the ASA’s concern that the ad could be interpreted as making an “energy reduced” comparative nutrition claim. Their consumer research provided insights into how consumers perceived the overall messaging of the ad. The majority of consumers understood that the ad as to be highlighting the taste of Cadbury Delights and suggesting that it delivered the same taste experience as other Cadbury chocolate products that they enjoyed. They also confirmed that Cadbury Delights used the same Cadbury chocolate found in most Cadbury-branded chocolate bars. Their intention was to emphasise the consistent Cadbury experience, not to make an “energy reduced” comparative claim. 1. & 2. Radiocentre said that during the course of the campaign submissions, they had initially cleared the claim “contains 91 calories” and they had not identified that the claim had changed to “only 91 calories”.","Only nutrition claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB NHC Register) could be made in ads promoting food or drink products. The BCAP Code defined a nutrition claim as any claim which stated, suggested or implied that a food (or drink) had particular beneficial nutritional properties due to the amount of calories, nutrients or other substances it contained, did not contain, or contained in reduced or increased proportions. In addition, the advertiser must ensure that the product met the conditions of use associated with the authorised claim. The ASA considered that in the context of the ad, which compared Cadbury Delights bars with other Cadbury products, the use of the statement “only 91 calories”, spoken twice in quick succession during the ad, served to emphasise that 91 calories was a low amount of calories for a chocolate bar. We therefore considered that listeners would understand the claim “only 91 calories” as a low calorie claim, which was equivalent to the “low energy” nutrition claim authorised on the GB NHC Register. The conditions of use for that claim allowed it to be made only where a product did not contain more than 40 kcal per 100 g for solids. We understood, however, that Cadbury Delights products contained either 413 or 415 kcal per 100 g, depending on the flavour of the product. We concluded that the claim “only 91 calories” was a “low energy” nutrition claim, but the Cadbury Delights products did not meet the conditions of use for that claim, and it therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached BCAP Code rules 13.4, 13.4.1 and 13.4.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health and nutrition claims). As referenced above, the ad compared Cadbury Delights bars with other Cadbury products, emphasising their similarity while implying that Cadbury Delights were low in calories. We considered that, in addition to that interpretation, listeners were also likely to interpret the claim “[…] Delights have that same chocolatey Cadbury taste […] Same soft nougat, same gooey caramel. But they're only 91 calories” to mean that by choosing a Cadbury Delights bar, they would get the same ingredients and taste experience as with other Cadbury bars, but with fewer calories. We therefore considered listeners were likely understand the ad to be implying that Cadbury Delights were a comparable, reduced-calorie alternative to other Cadbury chocolate bars, particularly those that featured nougat or caramel. Because of this, we considered that the ad included an implied “energy reduced” comparative nutrition claim. The BCAP code stated that comparative nutrition claims must compare the difference in the claimed nutrient to a range of foods of the same category which did not have the composition that allowed them to bear a nutrition claim. In the case of “energy reduced” comparative nutrition claims, the conditions of use stated on the GB NHC Register included that the energy value must be reduced by at least 30%, with an indication of the characteristics which made the food reduced in its total energy value. However, we understood that none of the Cadbury Delights products had 30% fewer calories than other Cadbury chocolate bars. We concluded that the ad made an “energy reduced” comparative nutrition claim in relation to Cadbury Delights products, but the products did not meet the conditions of use for that claim, and it therefore breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached BCAP Code rules 13.4, 13.4.1, 13.4.2, 13.5.1, 13.5.2 and 13.5.3 (Food, food supplements and associated health and nutrition claims).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Mondelez UK Ltd t/a Cadbury to ensure that when making nutrition and comparative nutrition claims they held evidence to show that the relevant products met the conditions of use for the claim.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/mondelez-europe-services-gmbh---uk-branch-a25-1276004-mondelez-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Wowcher Ltd,,"A website for Wowcher, www.wowcher.co.uk, seen on 13 March 2025, featured a listing for “K18 Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask”. The listing included an image of a bottle of hair product which featured the text “15ml”. Superimposed text read “NOW £28.99 £64.99 [crossed out]”. Text underneath the image stated, “SAVE 55 percent!”. Further text under the heading “Full Details” stated, “We’re offering you a K18 Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask for £28.99, saving you up to 55 percent off Global Fulfillment Limited [sic] (Forever cosmetics)’s’s [sic] price of £64.99 (correct as of 20.06.2024)"".",The complainant challenged whether the reference price and the associated savings claim were misleading.,"Wowcher Ltd stated that the merchant whose original selling price the ad referenced had not informed them that they were having a sale, which changed the price of the product to £39.99. They stated references to the price £64.99 had been removed from the listing. They added that they carried out regular checks on reference prices displayed on their site to ensure they were accurate, but on this occasion the issue was not identified prior to the ASA’s investigation.","The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) Guidance for Traders on Pricing Practices offered practical advice to traders on consumer protection laws and associated practices. While we noted that the guidance provided a set of principles rather than statutory rules, we took the Guidance into account when making our assessment. The Guidance stated that it was important that price comparisons were genuine. Comparing a current price to a higher one when it was not the last price the product was sold at, because there had been intervening prices, was an example given in the Guidance of a price comparison that might not be genuine. The Guidance also stated that, when considering whether a price comparison was genuine, attention should be given to whether the stated reference price was a realistic selling price for that product. The ASA understood that Wowcher was an e-commerce website through which consumers could purchase vouchers that afforded them a discount on a product or service, and that they did not sell their own products. Instead, consumers redeemed a voucher purchased from Wowcher with a merchant in order to arrange receipt of the goods or service. Because they allowed third-party merchants to advertise offers on their website, we considered that Wowcher were responsible for ensuring that those offers represented a genuine saving. We understood that the hair product advertised was available in different sizes, and that the ad was for a 15 ml bottle of that product. The ad stated, “NOW £28.99 £64.99 [crossed out]” and “SAVE 55 percent!”. We considered consumers would understand from those claims that £64.99 was the usual price at which the relevant merchant sold the product, and that by purchasing and redeeming the voucher they would achieve a genuine saving against the usual price of the product. In order to demonstrate that £64.99 was a realistic, usual selling price for that size of the product, we expected Wowcher to provide evidence that a significant number of sales had been made at that price. We did not receive detailed sales or pricing history for the product from Wowcher. However, we understood that £64.99 was not the immediately preceding price of the product, because the merchant whose price Wowcher was referencing currently had the product on sale for £39.99. We did not know for how long the product had been on sale, however, we noted from the ad that the last time the reference price had been verified as correct was June 2024. We therefore considered the savings claim for the product had not been made against the immediately preceding price at which the product was sold when the ad appeared. We also considered this suggested that £64.99 was not the usual selling price for that size of the product. Consequently, that meant the quoted 55 per cent saving was not genuine. Because we had not seen evidence that the savings claims made represented a genuine saving against the usual selling price of the product, we concluded the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.17 (Prices).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Wowcher Ltd to ensure that future savings claims did not mislead and that they substantiated any savings claims against the usual selling price of the product.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/wowcher-ltd-a25-1282964-wowcher-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Wowcher Ltd,,"A website for Wowcher, www.wowcher.co.uk, seen in March 2025, featured a mystery holiday offer. A banner at the top of the webpage included the claim “FROM £99pp + Est £3.99 admin fee*”. Text stated, “Mystery Holiday™: Maldives, New York, Mexico, Dubai, Bali, Disneyland Paris & More!”. Further text under the heading “How Does Mystery Holidays™ Work?” stated, “Purchase your Mystery Holiday for you and your travel companion. You will then receive your voucher codes and a link for redemption. Next, select preferred travel dates. Customers must redeem their vouchers as soon as possible using the link provided. You will then be asked to complete information relevant to your holiday booking. Your holiday destination will then be revealed! The merchant will then contact you via text message, telephone or email to arrange your flights from your desired airport region and inform you of where you’ll be staying. Then? Your holiday is booked and ready for you!”.","The complainant, who purchased a £99 mystery holiday, but was unable to book the holiday to the destination they were offered, challenged whether the promotion had been administered fairly.","Wowcher Ltd stated that they were a third-party marketplace and were not involved with the consumer journey after a purchase had been made. Before allowing a merchant to publish their offer on the Wowcher website, they required that the merchant gave assurances about the price and availability of the offer. Although the Mystery Holiday deal was promoted on the Wowcher website, it was fulfilled through third-party travel providers. Wowcher acknowledged that the complainant should have been able to book the holiday that they had been offered, since the third-party travel provider had uploaded an availability file with that date and destination. However, due to the dynamic nature of holiday prices and availability, at the point that the merchant contacted the complainant, they could no longer provide the holiday destination offered for that price. They understood from the third-party travel provider that the complainant had been offered alternative destinations and dates at the advertised price. Nevertheless, they had taken the decision to remove the travel provider from their Mystery Holiday merchant list.","The CAP Code stated that promoters were responsible for all aspects and stages of their promotions, which must be administered fairly and avoid causing unnecessary disappointment. It also stated that promoters, agencies, and intermediaries should not give consumers justifiable grounds for complaint. The ASA understood that Wowcher was an e-commerce website through which consumers could purchase vouchers that afforded them a discount on a product or service, and that they did not sell their own products. For Wowcher’s Mystery Holidays, Wowcher acted as the promoter for the offer. Once consumers purchased a voucher, they were required to select their preferred travel dates, airport region, and had to supply passenger information. The location of their holiday was then revealed based on availability provided by the third-party travel provider, who contacted the consumer to confirm the details of their holiday. We considered that consumers would understand from the ad that once their holiday destination had been revealed, they would be able to book a holiday to that destination without making any additional payments, unless a regional airport fee applied. As the consumer had already made the payment and provided their preferred travel dates before their holiday destination was revealed, we considered it was reasonable to expect that a holiday to that destination was available for that price. However, we understood that the complainant, who was told their holiday destination would be Rome, was unable to book a holiday to that destination because it was no longer available. Instead, we understood they were offered alternative destinations, which required an additional payment. We acknowledged that Wowcher did not provide the holidays themselves and had no part in the consumer journey after a Mystery Holiday voucher had been redeemed. We also understood that travel was a fast-moving sector where pricing and availability could change frequently. However, we considered that as the promoter for the deal, Wowcher had a responsibility to ensure that it was administered fairly at all stages. We understood that the link through which consumers entered their travel dates to reveal their holiday destination was supplied by Wowcher. Consumers were likely to view the reveal of their holiday destination as exciting, and experience considerable disappointment if they were subsequently unable to travel to that destination. We therefore considered Wowcher should have taken reasonable steps to avoid disappointing participants, for example, by ensuring that the third-party travel providers’ holiday information was accurate. Because the complainant had not been able to book the Mystery Holiday they had been offered, we considered that the promotion had not been administered fairly and was likely to have caused participants unnecessary disappointment. The promotion breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 8.1 and 8.2 (Promotional marketing) and 8.14 (Administration).",We told Wowcher Ltd to ensure that their promotions were administered fairly and to ensure that their promotions did not cause unnecessary disappointment.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/wowcher-ltd-a25-1284837-wowcher-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Wuxi Zhan'ao E-commerce Co Ltd t/a Lpows.com,,"A paid-for YouTube ad for a laser welding tool from the website Lpows.com, seen on 28 April 2025, featured on-screen text that stated, “Smart operation, even women can weld well. The built-in laser intelligent application system makes it easy for even novice operators to operate” and an image of a woman wearing a helmet. The video showed women using the laser welding tool as a voiceover described how to use it.","The complainant, who believed the ad perpetuated a harmful gender stereotype by suggesting that women were less skilled than men at mechanical or industrial tasks, challenged whether it breached the Code.",Wuxi Zhan'ao E-commerce Co Ltd t/a Lpows.com did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by Wuxi Zhan’ao E-commerce Co Ltd's lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. The CAP Code stated that advertisements must not include gender stereotypes that were likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence. The joint CAP and BCAP “Advertising guidance on depicting gender stereotypes likely to cause harm or serious or widespread offence” said that gender-stereotypical roles included occupations or positions usually associated with a specific gender, while gender-stereotypical characteristics included attributes or behaviours usually associated with a specific gender. It further stated that ads that directly contrasted male and female stereotypical roles or characteristics needed to be handled with care, and that care should be taken to avoid suggesting that stereotypical roles or characteristics were always uniquely associated with one gender and care should be taken to avoid suggesting that stereotypical roles or characteristics were never carried out or displayed by another gender. The ad featured on-screen text that stated, “Smart operation, even women can weld well. The built-in laser intelligent application system makes it easy for even novice operators to operate”. We considered that the statement “even women can weld well” implied that women were less skilled than men at performing mechanical tasks and that the laser welding tool was so easy to use, even women would be able to use it. We considered that statement, which was immediately followed by, “makes it easy for even novice operators to operate” was likely also to be understood to mean that women were novices at using mechanical tools. We concluded that the ad included a gender stereotype that was likely to cause harm or serious offence and therefore breached the Code.

ASA Ruling on Bodystreet Franchise (UK) Ltd t/a Bodystreet,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A website, www.bodystreet.co.uk, for Bodystreet, a fitness studio in Eastcote, featured the text “Bodystreet is an innovative workout studio that combines expert personal training with the buzz of Electro Muscle Stimulation (EMS)”. It explained that “At Bodystreet you wear a special training suit that helps your muscles work harder”. It stated, “We are Europe’s leading provider of EMS training”. Other text stated, “You can reach all your health & fitness goals with Bodystreet Eastcote - the fitness studio where 20 minutes of exercise is enough for the week!”. Under the heading, “Only 20 minutes”, the website stated, “In conventional exercise your muscles work between 40 to 70% of their capacity. During a Bodystreet workout your muscles work to more than 90% of their capacity. And that's with every contraction. With a Bodystreet workout using our high-tech suit you are able to achieve 85 contractions (reps) per second. This makes the training both intensive efficient and effective - hence only 20-minutes per week”. Elsewhere the website read, “This revolutionary fitness system is so effective that one 20 minute workout a week is enough to meet most people's goals and approximately 95% of our members at Bodystreet Eastcote train only once a week to achieve their fitness or weight loss goals […]. With Bodystreet all it takes is 20 minutes a week […]”. The website also stated, “EMS training doesn't just exercise and build up your muscles. It also stimulates the metabolism, which leads to a significant reduction in body fat within a very short time”.",The complainant challenged whether the following claims were misleading and could be substantiated:,"1. & 2. Bodystreet Franchise (UK) Ltd t/a Bodystreet said they understood the volume and level of evidence required to substantiate claims in their advertising. They submitted a meta-analysis, a systematic review, a combined systematic review and meta-analysis and three studies. They also provided an article on electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), a research-institute overview and two pieces of guidance from the NHS. They said their primary target customer base consisted of middle-aged or older adults, people returning to exercise after a long break, individuals with limited time or mobility, and people who found conventional gyms unapproachable or unsuitable. They believed that the cohorts within the studies provided were representative of their target customer base. Bodystreet explained that guidelines for safe use of EMS stipulated it should not exceed 20 minutes for all but the most athletic, due to intensity and recovery time, and to avoid the risk of muscle damage. They said that the statement that one session per week was sufficient was grounded in widely accepted industry guidance which cautioned against using EMS more than once per week. They said that this guidance came from the equipment manufacturer, their franchisor and an industry association. They were concerned that removing the reference to one session per week could encourage unsafe training frequency and expose consumers to health risks from excessive EMS usage. It was their operational experience that significant weight loss had been achieved through adherence to the Bodystreet method with only one session per week. They said that was supported by extensive member feedback across their studios and that 95% of their members trained once a week. They said that EMS training had been associated with various health and fitness benefits, including increased muscle strength, improved body composition, and enhanced physical performance. Bodystreet said that EMS could stimulate all major muscle groups simultaneously with adjustable intensity, making it time effective and, because of its low mechanical impact EMS was suitable for individuals regardless of age, size, mobility and fitness level, including those with joint problems. Bodystreet believed EMS induced short-term changes in muscle metabolism, as well as long-term improvements in muscle function and reductions in intramuscular fat. They said that increasing muscle mass through strength training sped up metabolic rate, made the body more efficient at burning calories and could lead to fat loss, when combined with a balanced diet. 3. Bodystreet believed they were the first company to introduce EMS boutique fitness studios and an EMS studio franchise model in 2007. They said they led the market with equipment innovation and workout methods. That was the basis of their claim to be Europe’s leading provider of EMS training. Notwithstanding that was the basis of the “leading” claim, they also said they had the most number of studios and memberships in Europe, and could also rely on size to make the claim. They provided a 2025 report on the European health and fitness market, produced by a non-profit organisation representing the European fitness sector, in conjunction with a consultancy firm. They said that they had been consistently recognised in this annual report as the leading EMS studio operator in Europe. They believed none of the other operators listed in the 2025 report specialised in EMS-only studios and that this substantiated their claim to be Europe’s leading provider.","The ASA considered that consumers would understand claims such as “one 20 minute workout a week is enough to meet most people's goals and approximately 95% of our members at Bodystreet Eastcote train only once a week to achieve their fitness or weight loss goals” to mean that one 20-minute EMS session at Bodystreet per week would provide an individual with the same physiological results, such as weight loss, cardio and muscle improvements, as a longer weekly session or multiple sessions at a traditional gym, and could therefore be a time-saving alternative. We considered that consumers would interpret it as an efficacy claim rather than a caution against using EMS more frequently. We acknowledged Bodystreet’s comments regarding their target customer base, however the claim referred to “most people” and therefore any evidence supporting that claim needed to be relevant to the general population. We considered that consumers would understand the claim “stimulates the metabolism, which leads to a significant reduction in body fat within a very short time” to mean EMS training would lead to a reduction in body fat in a very short time compared to a traditional gym workout because it stimulated the metabolism. As above, we considered that because the claim was not qualified to apply to particular groups of people, the evidence supporting it needed to relate to the general population. A substantive body of relevant evidence, consisting of clinical trials conducted on humans that had been published and peer-reviewed, was needed to substantiate both claims. We assessed the evidence provided by Bodystreet.The meta-analysis considered the results of five trials which measured the effects of whole-body EMS (W-BEMS) on people who had been classified as being at moderate to high cardiometabolic risk. The trials recorded the effects of W-BEMS on the participants’ metabolic syndrome score which included measurements for blood pressure, triglycerides, abdominal circumference and insulin resistance. We considered that cohort did not represent the general population, and the measurement outcomes were not relevant to the claims that one 20-minute session of EMS would provide equivalent benefits to longer sessions at a conventional gym or that EMS stimulated the metabolism to reduce fat in a very short time. We therefore considered the meta-analysis was not adequate substantiation for the claims in the ad. The systematic review covered 21 peer-reviewed studies that had applied electrical stimulation in lower and upper limbs simultaneously. The review authors observed that the studies exhibited a moderate to high risk of bias and noted a lack of randomised controlled studies on the subject. They commented that the limited amount of scientific evidence found did not allow for definitive conclusions about the effects of WB-EMS. We therefore considered that the systematic review was not adequate substantiation for the claims. The combined systematic review and meta-analysis covered 16 studies with 897 participants. The studies included some controlled trials, and WB-EMS trials with at least one exercise group and one control group. Across the studies, cohorts were of various ages, body mass indexes and physical conditions, although many studies focused on specific cohorts or conditions such as obesity or back pain. The authors acknowledged this restricted the extent to which the outcomes could be generalised. While WB-EMS was the only intervention in most of the studies, two combined WB-EMS with other interventions. This included a study on people with metabolic syndrome where participants had a calorie-restricted diet. The review reported some positive effects of WB-EMS effects on muscle mass and strength but not on total body fat. Furthermore, the results would apply predominately to moderately old to older, untrained or at least non-athletic cohorts, rather than the general population. The training frequency and duration of the interventions varied across the studies, from one to five sessions per week and were not limited to one 20-minute session of WB-EMS per week. Due to those limitations, we considered that the combined systematic review and meta-analysis was not adequate substantiation for the 20 minutes per week or metabolism-stimulation claims in the ad. The first of the three studies looked at the effect of EMS training on intramuscular fat in older adults. The cohort of 19 comprised nine women and 10 men, aged between 61 and 78. They performed EMS training of a specific muscle group on the front thigh three times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 30 minutes. Because the study had a small, unrepresentative cohort, exercised only one part of the body, lacked a control group, had more frequent and longer sessions than 20 minutes per week, and the only outcome measure was intramuscular fat, we considered it was not adequate substantiation for the claims. The second study looked at the effect of exercise training on fat loss. As it did not refer to EMS, we considered that it was not adequate to substantiate the claims. The third study looked at metabolic responses and muscle fatigue during whole body WB-EMS, voluntary exercise and their combination. It was partly funded by a manufacturer of fitness products and used a custom-made stimulator, based on a commercially developed device, for 15-minute exercise sessions. The cohort comprised 13 healthy men aged around 20. While the study suggested that the combination of W-BEMS, with low to middle intensity exercise could enhance metabolic response to a level equivalent to high intensity exercise, we considered that this did not equate to the claim that it stimulated the metabolism in such a way as to lead to a significant reduction in body fat in a very short time compared to a traditional gym workout. Furthermore, the study’s cohort was small and not representative of the general population. Also, the study did not include a control group and it was unclear whether the device used was the same as, or equivalent to, Bodystreet’s device. We therefore considered that the study was not adequate substantiation for the claims. We considered that the article, research-institute overview and NHS guidance, which provided generic information, some of which was unrelated to EMS, were not adequate substantiation for the claims. We concluded that the claims that 20 minutes of training at Bodystreet’s studio was enough for a week and therefore would provide an individual with the same physiological results, such as weight loss, cardio and muscle improvements, as a longer weekly session or multiple sessions at a traditional gym had not been substantiated. Neither had the claim that it stimulated the metabolism leading to a significant reduction in body fat in a very short time been substantiated, We therefore concluded the claims were misleading. On those points, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 3.11 (Exaggeration). We understood that Bodystreet had intended the claim “We are Europe’s leading provider of EMS training” to be a first-to-market claim. However, the claim was not qualified and we considered, in that context and in the absence of further explanatory text, consumers were likely to understand it to mean they were the market leader in Europe and therefore had the largest turnover. We acknowledged Bodystreet’s comment that they had the most number of studios and memberships in Europe, and we considered the report provided by them. The report was published in 2025, after the ad was seen. Notwithstanding that, whilst the report stated that Bodystreet had a large number of clubs in Europe (284), it did not state that Bodystreet was the largest provider of EMS training in Europe. Furthermore, the report did not cover all fitness chains in Europe and it stated that the information provided within it had not been verified or audited. We therefore considered that the report was not adequate substantiation for the claim. We concluded that the claim “We are Europe’s leading provider of EMS training” had not been substantiated and was misleading. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Bodystreet Franchise (UK) Ltd t/a Bodystreet not to claim that 20 minutes of exercise at their studio was enough for a week or that their EMS training stimulates the metabolism sufficient to reduce body fat within a very short time, unless they held adequate substantiation for the claims. We also told them not to claim they were Europe’s leading provider of EMS training, unless they held adequate substantiation for the claim.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/bodystreet-franchise--uk--ltd-a24-1271058-bodystreet-franchise--uk--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on HOMA Games SAS,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","An in-game ad for the mobile game app Tape Thrower, seen in the Belt It mobile app, on 29 March 2025. In low-detail, cartoon style animation, the ad featured a woman wearing only red heels and a facemask, standing on a catwalk with her hands on her hips. Her breasts and midsection were obscured by pixelation, although her belly button and the shape of her breasts were still visible. The tape thrower was directed towards her. Text in the caption below stated, “Tape Thrower” followed by “Throw and hit with duct tape!”.","The complainant, who believed the image was overly sexualised and objectified women, challenged whether the ad:","Homa Games SAS t/a Homa Games said that the ad was for Tape Thrower, which had a PEGI 3 rating on Google Play and a 4+ rating on the Apple App Store. The game was designed in a light-hearted, comedic style inspired by the ""prank"" genre and was not intended to offend or reinforce gender stereotypes. The ad was placed through third-party advertising platforms, which managed its distribution, including its appearance within the Belt It app. They acknowledged the concerns and paused the campaign in the UK. They said that they were reviewing internal processes to ensure better ad compliance.","The ad, which was for the 'Tape Thrower' game and depicted various scenarios, including one where the players could throw duct tape to hit and cover a woman’s body, featured a nude woman whose face was obscured by a facemask, with pixelation obscuring her midsection and breasts. We considered she was therefore depicted in a manner that was sexually suggestive and made her body the central focus of the ad. The ad also presented her as a passive target in the game. We considered that the ad objectified and stereotyped the woman by presenting her as a passive, sexual object with the sole purpose of titillating viewers. We concluded that the ad was likely to cause serious offence and included a gender stereotype in a way that was likely to cause harm. We understood the game was seen in the Belt It mobile app, a puzzle game which had an age rating of 4+ years and therefore could be downloaded by children. We considered that those playing an unrelated game would not expect to be served an ad which featured a naked woman, and considered the ad had been irresponsibly targeted. Notwithstanding that, because we considered that this specific ad was likely to cause serious offence and included a gender stereotype in a way that was likely to cause harm, it was not suitable to be featured in any game. We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code.The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told Homa Games SAS to ensure that their ads were socially responsible and did not cause serious or widespread offence, including by featuring a harmful gender stereotype by objectifying and sexualising women. We also told them to ensure that their ads were responsibly targeted.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/homa-games-sas-a25-1285213-homa-games-sas.html
ASA Ruling on Honeytech Ltd t/a Honeytoon,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","Two paid-for X (formally Twitter) ads for HoneyToons, a webcomic platform: a. The first ad, seen on 22 March 2025, featured the caption “[joker emoji] A harmless joke…or a path to unexpected consequences? When a simple prank spirals out of control, tension rises, and desires awaken. [Smirking emoji] What happens when boundaries are pushed too far? Find out in Prank Goes Wrong — where mischief turns into something much more intense… [fire emoji] [ devil emoji]”. An anime/manga-style image underneath, presented in a comic book layout, depicted a young woman and a man wrestling. She had him in a headlock, with her legs wrapped around his waist. A speech bubble read “BRO, I’M DONE WITH YOUR PRANKS!”. The following panel showed the same woman with an angry expression, accompanied by text that read “OMG!”, and “YO, IS THAT A THIRD LEG?”. A final image, in which she looked surprised, featured the text “OMG! BUT I’M YOUR SISTER!”. Underneath the image, text stated, “Hot comics, follow now! [fire emoji]”, with a hyperlink to honeytoon.com. b. The second ad, seen on 29 March 2025, featured the caption “[fire emoji] A honeymoon like no other…a desire too forbidden to resist. When boundaries shatter and temptation takes over, will he give in or walk away? [wink emoji] Honeymoon with My Mother-in-Law- a story where passion blurs the lines of family and seduction. Tap in if you can handle it…[wine emoji] [fire emoji]”. An image underneath, presented in the same style and comic book layout as ad (a), featured a man approaching a sleeping woman. A speech bubble read ""IS SHE ASLEEP?"" followed by another stating ""I’M SORRY BUT I CAN’T RESTRAIN MYSELF ANY LONGER!"". The scene portrayed in the next image was of the man smiling and standing behind the woman while she appeared shocked. The final panel showed the woman turning around with the text ""OMG!"" and ""BUT I’M YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW!"". Beneath the image, the text read ""Hot comics, follow now! [fire emoji]”, with a hyperlink to honeytoon.com.",,1. & 2. Honeytech Ltd t/a HoneyToon did not respond to the ASA's enquiries,"The ASA was concerned by Honeytech Ltd t/a HoneyToon’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The text in the caption, speech bubbles, and imagery in ad (a) portrayed a man becoming sexually aroused as a woman wrestled with him. The scene depicted the woman being placed in a sexual situation without consent, before revealing that they were brother and sister. In ad (b), the text in the caption, speech bubbles, and imagery depicted a man sexually assaulting his mother-in-law. Both ads featured sexually explicit content, which we considered was likely to cause serious and widespread offence in the context of an untargeted paid ad on X. Furthermore, the sexual situations depicted were non-consensual, with ad (b) unambiguously depicting sexual violence against a woman. Additionally, the portrayal of the women as a sister and mother-in-law to the men played on pornographic tropes relating to the taboos of incest and sexual relationships with other family members. We considered those aspects of the ads’ content were also likely to cause serious and widespread offence. We additionally considered both ads objectified and stereotyped women by presenting them as objects of sexual gratification and therefore included a gender stereotype that was likely to cause harm. For those reasons we considered the ads were not suitable to be featured in any medium. While we acknowledged the ads were for a webcomic platform featuring adult themes and sexually suggestive and explicit content, we considered the advertiser must ensure that their ads did not feature content which was likely to cause offence or harm. Overall, we concluded that ads (a) and (b) breached the Code, because: they were likely to cause both serious and widespread offence; included gender stereotypes in a manner likely to cause harm: and had been irresponsibly targeted. On points 1 and 2, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), and 4.1 and 4.9 (Harm and offence).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Honeytech t/a HoneyToon to ensure future ads were prepared responsibly, did not contain harmful gender stereotypes, and did not cause serious or widespread offence, including through references to incest, scenes that depicted women as objects of sexual gratification or that trivialised or condoned sexual assault or sexual violence.

ASA Ruling on SaffPro,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A TikTok post and a paid-for Facebook post for SaffPro, a range of saffron-containing supplements: a. The TikTok post, on Chantelle Knight’s account, neurodiverselife2, seen on 21 December 2024. The video, a duet with the SaffPro TikTok account, featured Ms Knight, an internet personality with links to the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) community, who stated, “Why would we choose a nutraceutical over a pharmaceutical?” as images of SaffPro product packs, then generic pills, appeared next to her on-screen. She continued, “There are people who will respond to certain pharmaceutical medications, but there will always be people who do not respond to them […] there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people out there who do not choose to put pharmaceutical drugs in their body; another reason for this is the incredible withdrawals and side effects that can come with them […] Bringing nutraceuticals to the discussion around physical and mental health is incredibly important […] It is an exceptionally exciting time to see somebody starting to stand up and challenge what we are led to believe is the only way to manage our cognitive and emotional function.” A voice-over at the end of the video, accompanied by images of SaffPro products, included “These powerful gummies and pops combine the best of nutrition and medicine, helping you stay strong, focused and energised every day. With our SaffPro products, your sleep will be at ease, increased mood stability, and it comes with powerful antioxidant.” b. The paid-for Facebook post from SaffPro, posted on 4 February 2025, also featured Ms Knight discussing SaffPro products, who made a number of claims including, “Saffron […] supports the creation of Dopamine”, “stimulant ADHD medicine will increase dopamine, but so will saffron”, “I choose SaffPro”, “Saffron is also known as an anti-inflammatory”, “saffron boosts serotonin […] a really key chemical in the management of ADHD, and saffron will boost your serotonin levels through the roof”, and “Saffron directly increases the amount of melatonin that we have in our system”.",The complainant challenged whether:,"1., 2. & 3. Saff-Pro LLC t/a SaffPro did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.Chantelle Knight said she was willing to make any necessary changes to her posts to ensure compliance with the CAP Code.","The ASA was concerned by SaffPro’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. The CAP Code (which reflected legislation) stated that claims which stated or implied a food prevented, treated or cured human disease were not acceptable in marketing communications for foods or food supplement products. Ad (b) included claims that people with ADHD did not have enough dopamine, serotonin or melatonin and that this led to ADHD symptoms such as lack of focus, a difficulty in regulating emotions and issues with sleep. It also stated that neuroinflammation exacerbated ADHD symptoms. In that context we considered claims such as the following would be understood as claims that SaffPro products could treat ADHD and its symptoms: “I can get more dopamine to access the chemicals that I need to stay focused, stay motivated, and regulate my emotions”; “boost your serotonin levels through the roof""; “increases the amount of melatonin that we have in our system”; and “Saffron is also known as an anti-inflammatory”. The ad further included the claim that by consuming SaffPro products “we are supporting and promoting a healthier, happier brain environment and therefore supporting our ADHD”. We considered that was also a claim the products could treat ADHD. We acknowledged that ad (a), which was posted from Ms Knight’s TikTok account, did not directly reference ADHD. However, we noted Ms Knight’s wider presentation as a person with deep ties to the ADHD community, and that her posts on TikTok and other social media platforms primarily related to ADHD. Additionally, we considered her TikTok username, @neurodiverselife2, reinforced her links to, and association with, the neurodiverse community, which typically included people with ADHD. In that context, we considered that the discussion in ad (a) around the use of “nutraceuticals” instead of, or in combination with, “pharmaceutical” medications would be understood by viewers to relate to their use as a treatment for conditions including ADHD. The ad referred to SaffPro products as “nutraceuticals” and we therefore considered viewers would understand that those products could treat ADHD. Because of that, we also considered viewers were likely to understand some of the claims in the voice-over at the end of the ad as referencing symptoms of ADHD, and that SaffPro products could treat those symptoms: “These powerful gummies and pops combine the best of nutrition and medicine, helping you stay […] focused […] With our SaffPro products, your sleep will be at ease, increased mood stability […]”. Claims that SaffPro products could treat ADHD and its symptoms were, for the purposes of the legislation reflected in the Code, claims that a food or food supplement could prevent, treat or cure disease, and were therefore prohibited by the Code. We therefore concluded that all the above claims in ads (a) and (b) breached the Code. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.6 and 15.6.2 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims). The CAP Code stated that only health claims authorised on the Great Britain nutrition and health claims register (the GB NHC Register) were permitted in marketing communications for food or food supplements. The Code defined health claims as those that stated, suggested or implied a relationship between a food or ingredient, and health. The voice-over at the end of ad (a) included the claims “These powerful gummies and pops combine the best of nutrition and medicine, helping you stay strong […] and energised every day […] and it comes with powerful antioxidant”. We considered viewers were unlikely to associate those claims with the treatment of symptoms of ADHD and would instead understand them as describing health benefits the products would provide for all consumers: that is, the support of physical strength, energy levels and the protection of cells from oxidative stress. We considered those claims were specific health claims for the purposes of the Code. We had not seen evidence that demonstrated they were authorised on the GB NHC Register in relation to the supplement or any of its ingredients. We therefore concluded ad (a) also breached the Code in that regard. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 15.1, 15.1.1 (Food, food supplements and associated health or nutrition claims), and 15.7 (Food supplements and other vitamins and minerals). Ad (a) stated that some people would not respond to “pharmaceutical” medications, and that millions of people chose not to use medications due to the associated withdrawals and side effects. As referenced above, we considered consumers would understand from the context of the ad, its presentation of images of SaffPro products, and the presence of Ms Knight and her TikTok username, @neurodiverselife2, that the term “pharmaceutical medications” was referring to medications prescribed for the treatment of ADHD. Ad (b) referred to parents “using stimulant medication through the day […] and then something like an antipsychotic […] at night to help put their child to sleep”, and included claims which implied that saffron, a key ingredient in SaffPro’s products, could produce the same effects as medicines prescribed for the treatment of ADHD, such as improving focus, providing a calming effect, and helping with attention and concentration. We considered that in making those claims, both ads suggested that consumers, including children, could take the advertised supplement as an effective alternative to medically prescribed treatments. We considered that the wording of ad (a), and the reference to withdrawal and side-effects, could also have the effect of undermining consumer’s confidence in medicines prescribed for the treatment of ADHD. We further considered that the claims in ad (b) implied that SaffPro’s products were equivalent to medicines prescribed to treat ADHD and noted that the ad specifically addressed parents of children with ADHD. We therefore considered the claims were irresponsible. Because both ads irresponsibly discouraged people from taking medically prescribed treatments for ADHD, including parents who supervised their children’s medical treatment, we concluded that they breached the Code. On that point, ads (a) and (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.3 (Social responsibility).","The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Saff-Pro LLC t/a SaffPro not to make specific health claims about their products unless they were authorised on the GB NHC Register, and to ensure their future advertising did not make claims that food, including food supplements, could prevent, treat or cure conditions that, for the purposes of the Code, fell within the definition of human disease. We also told them to ensure their ads did not irresponsibly encourage consumers to stop taking medically prescribed treatments for ADHD. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/saffpro.html
ASA Ruling on Koi Footwear Ltd,,"An email from Koi Footwear, received on 2 April 2025 featured the subject heading “Take two and call us in the morning [pill emoji] [pill emoji]”. The body of the email included a photo of a syringe and a vial containing pink liquid. The vial included text on the side which stated, “KOI”. Text above the image stated, “// SIDE EFFECTS: MAY INCLUDE OBSESSION.” Underneath that, product images of Koi shoes were featured.","The complainant, who believed the ad glamourised drug use, challenged whether the ad was offensive and irresponsible because it encouraged or condoned drug use.","Koi Footwear Ltd stated that the ad was inspired by Japanese subcultures, biotech aesthetics, and video game references, in particular, the Silent Hill franchise. They said the imagery and text used, including pills and syringes, were intended to symbolise transformation and synthetic enhancement, but that the campaign was intended to be surreal and tongue-in-cheek, and was not intended to reference real drug use or glamorise substance abuse. They said phrases such as “Take two and call us in the morning” and “// SIDE EFFECTS: MAY INCLUDE OBSESSION” were intended to fit within that fictional context, but not to promote irresponsible behaviour. They said that they did not support, encourage, or glamorise drug use in any form, and they fully understood the importance of avoiding messaging that could be seen as promoting such behaviour. In light of this, they were reviewing how these particular creative elements may have been interpreted and were open to making amendments or adding contextual disclaimers in future campaigns to avoid misunderstanding.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society, and that ads must not contain anything that was likely to cause serious or widespread offence. The ASA considered that the subject line of the email “Take two and call us in the morning” including the pill emojis, referenced medical dosage instructions in a way that would be familiar to consumers. We further considered that the visual presentation of the syringe and the pink liquid in the branded “Koi” vial in the body of the email closely resembled drug paraphernalia and, alongside the wording “// SIDE EFFECTS: MAY INCLUDE OBSESSION”, directly linked Koi’s products to drug culture and use. We noted Koi Footwear’s explanation that the ad was intended to be surreal and fictional, however, we considered that recipients of the email would interpret the syringe and language literally, as drug related. We considered that the depiction of the branded syringe, alongside a phrase mimicking medical advice, and a reference to its side effects including “OBSESSION”, trivialised drug use and glamorised the idea of addictive behaviour as an appealing or stylish trait. In that context, we concluded that the ad condoned and encouraged drug use, and was therefore irresponsible, and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility) and 4.1 (Harm and offence).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

ASA Ruling on CLF Distribution Ltd,,"An email from CLF Distribution, a health food wholesaler, seen on 10 December 2024. The body of the email included the headline “These jams are crafted with high-quality, naturally sweet ingredients”. Below the headline, there was an image of four flavours of jam. Text within the image stated, “NO ADDED SUGAR? SWEET!”. Further text stated, “These jams are crafted with high-quality, naturally sweet ingredients that deliver all the fruity flavour and richness of traditional jams without the sugar spike”.","The complainant challenged whether the claim “naturally sweet ingredients” was misleading, because the products contained erythritol and steviol glycosides.",CLF Distribution Ltd did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by CLF Distribution Ltd’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to respond promptly to our enquiries and told them to do so in future. The ASA considered that traders would understand the term “naturally sweet ingredients” to mean the sweetening ingredients in the product were completely natural. We considered traders would understand that some processing may need to take place in order to make a naturally found ingredient fit for human consumption, but that such processing would be minimal. Ingredients which underwent more than minimal processing were unlikely to be understood as completely natural. The jams promoted in the ad included the sweetener erythritol, a sugar alcohol. We understood that in commercial production, erythritol was manufactured through a corn fermentation process, rather than having been directly isolated or extracted from a plant. We further understood that the purification of erythritol typically involved an ion exchange. We considered those types of processing would not be understood by traders to be in line with their expectations of a sweetener described as a “naturally sweet ingredient”. The jams also included steviol glycosides. We acknowledged that this sweetener was derived from a natural source, the stevia plant. However, we understood that to isolate steviol glycosides from the stevia plant, manufacturers used multiple chemical processes including extraction with solvents, filtration, ion exchange and crystallisation. We considered those types of processing were unlikely to be in line with traders’ expectations of a sweetener described as a “naturally sweet ingredient”. For the above reasons, we concluded that the claim “naturally sweet ingredients” was not substantiated and therefore the ad was misleading. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising) and 3.7 (Substantiation).",The ad must not appear again in its current form.

ASA Ruling on LC International Ltd t/a Ladbrokes,"Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld","A TV ad and a Video on Demand (VOD) ad for Ladbrokes: a. The TV ad, seen on 17 December 2024, featured a voice-over that stated, “This is a Ladbuck, the new way to get rewarded at Ladbrokes, and these are some of the 100 million Ladbucks that will be dropping weekly. Collect them on our free to play games and choose rewards like free spins, free bets and more. Over 100 million Ladbucks dropping every single week. Plus you can even use them to play your favourite games for free in our Ladbucks arcade. Like Fishin Frenzy and Goldstrike. Start collecting at Ladbrokes.com.” The ad featured imagery of coins that displayed the initials ‘Lb’, as well as text that stated “100m LADBUCKS”, FREE BETS” and “FREE SPINS”. b. The VOD ad, seen on Channel 4 on Demand on 23 December 2024, was the same as ad (a).","Two complainants who believed the term ‘Ladbucks’ was likely to be of strong appeal to those under 18 years of age, challenged whether:","1 & 2. LC International Ltd t/a Ladbrokes said both ads promoted ‘Ladbucks’, which was their rewards programme. Ladbucks were tokens, depicted as coins, that consumers collected for free by participating in selected promotions, which were then used to redeem offers within the ‘Ladbucks Store’ or the ‘Ladbucks arcade’. They could only be used by logged-in, verified over-18 consumers. They stated tokens could not be purchased, had no monetary value and expired if not used. They explained that Ladbucks did not have a general market value with an exchange rate, and they could not be universally used across all products on the Ladbrokes site. They said each eligible product or offer had a set value, which was in contrast to in-game currency products. Ladbrokes said that, in the context of their rewards programme, the term Ladbucks was chosen as a play on the word Ladbrokes, and because it referenced, through the use of the term bucks, that it had value on the Ladbrokes website. They believed the term ‘bucks’ was known as a colloquialism for dollars and was widely used to refer to money or a unit of currency in many contexts, which included video games. They said that the word had no origins in youth culture and believed that it was not of inherent strong appeal to under-18s. They highlighted that both ads had targeting restrictions to reduce the likelihood of children viewing them. Ladbrokes believed that the term was not associated with any coins from videogames which were popular with under-18s. They said that ‘V-bucks’ from Fortnite and ‘Robux’ from Roblox were in-game currencies that had to be purchased before being used to buy in-game items. They also said that certain elements of Robux required parental consent and, for subscription services, the purchaser must be over 18. Therefore, the only similarity between those coins and Ladbucks coins was the term bucks. They had reviewed the rewards programme in its entirety and believed there was no risk of the term being associated with Fortnite or Roblox. Ladbrokes said many other industries used reward schemes for consumers and the concept was not unique to video games which were popular with under-18s. They also said that as a licensed gambling operator that offered casino and poker products, using imagery of a ‘poker chip’ should not be considered imagery that was of strong appeal to under-18s. Therefore, they believed there was nothing in the imagery or the content of the ads that shared similarities with either of those games. They did not believe the term “lad” referred to a boy or young man and said their brand had never been used in that context. They also said the term “lad” itself was not specifically mentioned by the complainants. Clearcast did not believe the term Ladbucks in ad (a) appealed strongly to children. They understood that the coin was Ladbrokes’ version of free prize tokens within their rewards programme, and that they could have been used on certain promotional offers until they expired. They did not believe the tokens were similar to in-game currencies, in which those tokens had to be purchased. Channel 4 believed ad (b), which was broadcast on their streaming service, was compliant with the Code.","The BCAP and CAP Code stated that gambling ads must not be likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture. Because the ads had appeared in mediums where under-18s could not be entirely excluded from the audience, they needed to comply with that rule. BCAP and CAP guidance, “Gambling and lotteries advertising: protecting under-18s”, stated that marketers should exercise particular caution when depicting product features similar to recognisable video games, online games popular among under-18s, or common features of such games in general. It also stated that content linked to activities that were very popular or common among younger people (in terms of their direct participation and viewing) was at risk of being of strong appeal to under-18s. The ASA first assessed if there were online games which featured tokens depicted as coins, and whether they were very popular with children and strongly associated with youth culture, before considering if features of those coins had noticeable parallels with a Ladbuck. We understood that several online games popular with under-18s, such as Roblox and Fortnite, had their own in-game currencies, which were called Robux and V-bucks respectively. Those currencies, which could be both purchased and earnt through gameplay, were depicted as coins, and spent within in-game stores, usually on cosmetic items that enhanced gameplay. According to Ofcom’s 2024 report into media use and attitudes, 60% of children aged between 3 and 17 years gamed online, whilst 89% of 11–18-year-olds gamed online weekly. Overall, categories of games that were most popular included building games, such as Roblox, followed by games played against others, such as Fortnite. We also understood that many under-18s engaged with content related to both those games via YouTube, Twitch and TikTok. Data from the Academy of Animated Arts showed Fortnite had the most combined YouTube and Twitch weekly viewing hours of any game. Roblox had over 32 million daily active users under the age of 13 at the end of 2024. In addition, 24% of children aged 10–12 years played Roblox in the UK. Based on that data, we considered a significant number of under-18s were likely to be familiar with those games and their specific features, which included reward schemes that involved earning and using coins in associated game stores. For those reasons, we considered both games and their associated features were strongly associated with youth culture. Given that context, we assessed whether the term Ladbucks, through its name and in conjunction with how the coin was depicted in the ads, was likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s due to its similarities to those in-game currencies. We first assessed the similarities between the names of the coins. We considered the term Ladbucks, through the suffix ‘bucks’, had strong similarities to the in-game currencies Robux and V-bucks. We acknowledged Ladbrokes’ view that the term bucks was a well-known colloquialism for dollars and we did not consider the use of the word bucks in isolation to be of strong appeal. However, we also understood the term V-buck was a shortened version of ‘Vindertech’ buck, which was a fictional company in Fortnite. Similarly, we considered the word ‘lad’ had been taken from the company name Ladbrokes to create the name of their token. Therefore, we considered the construction of the token names, enhanced the similarity between the names of the coins, which due to the popularity of those games with children, many under-18s were likely to recognise. In addition, whilst we accepted the use of the prefix ‘lad’ was for its link to the brand, and we did not consider the brand’s name itself to be of appeal to children, we also considered that ‘lad’ was a colloquial term for a boy or young man. In the context of the ad and its use alongside the word buck, the word lad would have also been recognised and of appeal to some under-18s. We next assessed the overall depiction of the tokens. The style of both the Ladbuck and V-Buck had similarities with a poker chip. The Ladbuck token’s design was round, shiny around the edges with an initial in its centre. Those were features that were all present in the design of a V-buck. Whilst a ‘Robux’ was at the time the ads were seen, a different shape, we understood it was still sometimes depicted in its previous form, which again resembled a poker chip with the initial ‘R’ and a dollar sign in the middle. Although we acknowledged that Ladbrokes offered poker and casino games, we considered it was not the use of poker chip imagery in isolation, but the use of the token’s imagery when used in conjunction with the term Ladbucks, that was likely to have been recognisable and perceived by many under-18s as similar to those in-game currencies of online games that were of strong appeal to under-18s. In addition, we noted the Ladbucks tokens could be used in the online Ladbrokes store and arcade and that was likely to be reminiscent of the way in-game currencies Robux and V-bucks were used. Therefore, we considered that was likely to further enhance its appeal to children through its resemblance to tokens used in gaming, with which they would likely be familiar. For those reasons we concluded the name Ladbucks, when considered alongside the imagery and the application of the coin in the ads, was depicted in a manner which was similar to features in video games popular with children. We therefore considered the term in the ads was likely to be of strong appeal to under-18s and breached the Code. On those points, ad (a) breached BCAP Code rules 17.4.5 (Gambling) and ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 16.1 and 16.3.12 (Gambling).",The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told LC International t/a Ladbrokes not to include content in ads that was reflective of youth culture or which had strong appeal to those under 18 years of age.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/lc-international-ltd-g25-1274110-lc-international-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Mars Wrigley Confectionery UK Ltd,,"A TV and VOD ad seen in March 2025: a. The TV ad showed a man driving a car, being followed by a second car. The man sped up, put the hand brake on, swerved to the right-hand side of the road and broke through a metal barrier, leaving the road in a cloud of dust. The man was then shown inside the car falling down a rocky hill. The second car stopped at the point where the first car left the road, with the broken barrier and dust still visible. The first car was then shown upside down but placed on top of an identical car at the bottom of the hill. The same man was in both cars, one upside down, the second upright. The man in the car below looked up through the sunroof at the man above. As the first man grasped the gear stick, a second hand was shown from above placing it on his hand. The car was then put in gear and drove off with the second car attached above it. Both cars, attached, drove along a road with on-screen text that said, “TWO IS MORE THAN ONE TWIX”. b. The VOD ad included the same content as ad (a).",Five complainants believed that ads (a) and (b) encouraged dangerous driving and were irresponsible.,"Mars Wrigley Confectionery UK Ltd (Mars Wrigley) said the ad had a cinematic presentation and was set in a separate world that was absurd, fantastical and removed from reality. They explained the ad was split into two parts. The first part had a good versus bad theme, reminiscent of classic films. The cars were shot driving at lawful speeds and any emulation would only reflect the legal and safe driving presented. They said they had removed identifiers of the real world from the road scenes, including vehicles, pedestrians, or road signage, to distance the setting from reality. The second part of the ad, a dual car performing a stunt that defied physics, depicted a scenario that was clearly exaggerated and not possible in reality. The surreal moment highlighted that the scene was clearly fictional and tongue in cheek. That was further emphasised by scenes of two hands operating a gear shift, a hand break turn that was not possible in real life and the man shown calmly driving off a cliff. They made sure the action was clearly in a fantasy world and would be impossible to recreate. They said Twix was further known for its playful and absurd tone and the humour in the ad reflected that and aligned with the slogan ‘Two is More Than One’. That slogan also featured at the end of the ad and reinforced the irreverent humour of the ad. The slogan when taken literally was inherently comical and aligned with the fantastical tone of the rest of the ad. Clearcast stated that the ad’s fantastical and cinematic presentation made it clear the driving was exaggerated and not intended to be emulated. It therefore did not encourage people to breach the Highway Code or suggest safe driving was boring. It used imaginative storytelling, using absurd elements and a Hollywood style, to project the message that ""Two is More Than One"" and did so in a way that was unlikely to be understood as showing reasonable driving practices.","The CAP and BCAP Codes stated that ads must not condone or encourage irresponsible driving or a breach of the legal requirements of the Highway Code. The man driving the first car was shown smiling as his car fell down a hill, only for it to be seen again with an identical car on top of it. A second man was in that car and reached through the sunroof to place his hand on the first man’s hand. Both cars were shown driving off, one on top of the other. The ASA therefore acknowledged that the ad contained some clearly fantastical elements in the latter part of the ad and had a cinematic feel overall. However, at the start of the ad the driver was shown on an ordinary road, when a car approached behind him. We considered the road was clearly realistic, albeit in an isolated and exotic location, with lane dividers visible and both cars ensuring they stayed on one side of the road, replicating real life. The second car then appeared to be approaching the initial car rapidly and the engine sound was audible. On noticing the car, the first man was shown immediately putting his car in gear, with a determined expression on his face, and appeared to be speeding up to evade the car. The feeling of speed was emphasised by the fast paced beat and music. Therefore, the scenes were depicted as a chase with the emphasis on speed. In addition, the first man was then shown putting the handbrake on and the car swerved off the road leaving visible skid marks. We considered the emphasis on a chase, and the speed inherent to that, and the driving manoeuvres featured would be dangerous and irresponsible if emulated in real life on a public highway. Because we considered the driving depicted in the ads condoned unsafe driving, that appeared likely to breach the legal requirements of the Highway Code, we concluded the ads were irresponsible. Ad (a) breached BCAP Code rules 20.1 and 20.2 (Motoring) and ad (b) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 19.2 and 19.3 (Motoring).",The ads must not appear again in their current form. We told Mars Wrigley Confectionery UK Ltd not to condone or encourage irresponsible driving that was likely to breach the legal requirements of the Highway Code in their ads.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/mars-wrigley-confectionery-uk-ltd-g25-1285557-mars-wrigley-confectionery-uk-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Navi Organics Ltd,"On 7 April 2025, the Advertising Codes were updated to reflect the revocation and restatement of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (“CPRs” – the legislation from which the majority of the CAP and BCAP rules on misleading advertising derived) by the Unfair Commercial Practices provisions in the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (“DMCCA”). On that date, the wording of a number of the rules in the Advertising Codes was changed to reflect relevant changes introduced by the DMCCA on 6 April 2025. Given that the complaint that formed the subject of this ruling were received before 7 April 2025, the ASA considered the ad and complaint under the wording of the rules that existed prior to 7 April 2025, and the Ruling (and references to rules within it) should therefore be read in line with this wording, available here – CAP Code and BCAP Code . Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","The website for Na’vi Organics, an online retailer selling health and wellness products, www.naviorganics.uk, seen in February 2025, featured, on The Healy Device page, a heading: “Bio-Resonance and Cell Health with the Healy Device”. Text below stated, “The Healy is a bio-resonance tool that works to support your body’s energetic field to promote deep cellular healing. Reduced cell voltage occurs in almost all cases of acute and chronic dis-ease [sic]. Reduced cell voltage causes the cell’s internal metabolic processes to malfunction leading to disease. The Healy can help restore equilibrium through the use of resonant frequency waves. It works to stimulate and restore optimum cellular function with the use of very specific harmonic energetic currents.” The website went on to detail various programmes available on the device. Programme names listed included “Program Chronic Pain”, “Mental Balance” and “Sleep”. Further text stated, “We were not designed to be depressed, anxious, highly reactive or suffer from chronic pain and exhausting conditions of disease. These may be symptoms of underlying health concerns. The Healy is designed to support wellbeing through harmonization of the Bioenergetic Field.” Further text stated, “The Healy device is recognised as a medical device within the EU for the treatment of chronic pain, migraines, fibromyalgia and skeletal pain"". Text at the foot of the web page entitled NOTICE stated, “The Individualized Microcurrent Frequency (IMF) programs of the Healy device are not medical applications. They are not intended to cure, treat, mitigate, diagnose, or prevent any disease or medical condition. The terms used in the programs do not constitute statements concerning their effects. Healy programmes should not be treated as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. You should always seek such advice from a qualified medical professional. If you have or suspect you may have a medical condition, or if you are under the care of a healthcare practitioner, you should consult your practitioner before using Healy. Always use your Healy according to the Instructions for Use. Science does not acknowledge the existence of the Information Field, its analysis, harmonization and other importance due to the lack of scientific evidence. Individualized Microcurrent Frequency (IMF) programs of the Healy device, Quantum Potential Frequencies (QPF) of the Healy Coil and the magnetic field programs of the MagHealy device are not acknowledged by conventional medicine due to the lack of scientific evidence in the sense of conventional medicine. The information on this page is for reference and educational purposes only.”",The Good Thinking Society challenged whether the following claims for the product were misleading and could be substantiated:,"1., 2. & 3. Na’vi Organics Ltd (Na’vi) said the ad appeared on their website as part of the Healy affiliate programme; they did not, however, actively promote the device to their customer base. Na’vi explained that they had sourced the content directly from the Healy website and it had not been reviewed it for several years. They said they were willing to make changes to bring their advertising in line with the Code.","The ad stated, “The Healy is a bio-resonance tool that works to support your body’s energetic field to promote deep cellular healing. Reduced cell voltage occurs in almost all case of acute and chronic dis-ease […] The Healy can help restore equilibrium through the use of resonant frequency waves.” The ASA considered that consumers would understand from the ad that bio-resonance could affect cell health positively by providing equilibrium for cell voltage. We also considered that they would infer from the claim “Reduced cell voltage occurs in almost all cases of acute and chronic dis-ease [sic]” that the device could identify and treat underlying health issues. The ad also referred to conditions such as fibromyalgia, sleep problems and anxiety. We considered that in the context of an ad that referred to healing, consumers would understand that the device was effective in treating the listed medical conditions. We were previously made aware by the advertiser that the Healy was classified as a Class IIa medical device. However, CE certification in itself did not constitute evidence for medical efficacy claims, and advertisers needed to ensure that they held evidence for such claims. We had not been provided with any evidence that the product could be used to diagnose existing or future medical conditions or prevent or treat disease or illness. Furthermore, we had not seen evidence to support the claims in the ad regarding the role of bio-resonance in cellular healing. We welcomed Na’vi’s willingness to make changes to their advertising. However, because we had not seen evidence to support the claims that the device could treat the listed medical conditions, nor had we received substantiation for the claims about bio-resonance, we concluded that the ad was likely to mislead. On those points, the ad breached CAP Code rules 3.1 (Misleading advertising), 3.7 (Substantiation) and 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products). The CAP Code stated that marketers must not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought. For example, they must not offer specific advice on, diagnosis of, or treatment for such conditions, unless that advice, diagnosis or treatment was conducted under the supervision of a suitably qualified medical professional. The ad stated, “We were not designed to be depressed”. Additionally, the reference to Healy’s status as a medical device listed migraine among the conditions that could be treated. The ad also referred to chronic pain. We considered that consumers would understand from the ad that they could use the device to treat depression, migraine and chronic pain. The Code required that treatment for those conditions be conducted under medical supervision. We acknowledged that the “NOTICE” section stated that the device should not be treated as a substitute for medical advice and that a qualified medical professional should always be consulted. However, the ad also featured a heading “Easy to use” which described setting up the device and connecting the electrodes. The ad further stated, “You can use the device for prolonged periods, of time, running continuous programs throughout the day or just occasionally to boost your vitality and well-being as needed. For example, at the end of a stressful day at work.” We considered that the ad presented the device as being for home use, without any initial or ongoing monitoring or supervision by a medical professional. We also considered that the “NOTICE” text, which appeared at the foot of the web page, could easily be overlooked by consumers and was insufficient to counter the overall impression given by the ad. We therefore concluded that the ad discouraged essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought and that it had breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.2 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).","The ad must not appear again in the form complained of. We told Na’vi Organics Ltd not to make efficacy claims for the Healy Device in the absence of adequate evidence. We also told them to ensure their future ads did not discourage essential treatment for conditions for which medical supervision should be sought, including depression, migraine and chronic pain.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/navi-organics-ltd-a24-1272405-navi-organics-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on LiveScore Betting & Gaming (Gibraltar) Ltd t/a LiveScore Bet,,"Two in-app ads for LiveScore Bet seen on LiveScore, a football score app, on 10 January 2025: a. The first ad, viewed on an Android device, featured text that displayed live football scores. The page also featured the LiveScore Bet logo next to an on/off toggle. When toggled on, three ‘odds’ options were displayed under each game. Each option linked through to the “LiveScore Bet” app when clicked on. b. The second ad, viewed on an IOS device, featured a page which displayed football team lineups. Beneath the lineups a banner displayed text which stated, “Match odds” and “LiveScore Bet” along with three different odds that linked through to the LiveScore Bet app when clicked. Further smaller text stated, “18+ Bet responsibly. BeGambleAware.org” and “Ad”.","The complainant, who understood the ads were served in the under-18 version of the app, challenged whether they had been appropriately targeted.","LiveScore Betting and Gaming (Gibraltar) Ltd t/a LiveScore Bet said they were a distinct product from the LiveScore app. However, they both operated within the same corporate structure, which was the “LiveScore Group”. They explained that LiveScore was a real-time sports data, news and content provider that did not offer gambling services whilst LiveScore Bet was a licensed online sports-betting product. LiveScore Bet said they selected LiveScore as an advertising partner because of the app’s audience demographic which they believed was predominantly adults. They also said LiveScore implemented an age-gating tool that was a voluntary safeguard used to prevent adult content from being shown to under-18s. They explained that through the age-gating mechanism the LiveScore app would only display odds and gambling content to users who had declared themselves as over-18. LiveScore Bet carried out testing on the under-18 version of the app for Android devices because the complainant believed they saw ad (a) there. However, they had been unable to replicate instances of any gambling content being shown when the under-18 option was selected. They believed no further device information for where the ad had been viewed was available and there was no proof that there had been any technical problem with the app for Android devices. They were therefore confident that LiveScore’s age-gating tool had been working as intended at the time ad (a) was seen, with the under-18 version not promoting any gambling content. LiveScore Bet also said a technical problem in a historic IOS version of the app had resulted in gambling content being displayed to users who had selected ‘under-18’, which was why ad (b) had been seen in that version of the app. However, they believed further testing indicated that where odds had been displayed, they did not link through to any further gambling content. They also said the current version of the app was working correctly and the issue had been confined to one IOS app version that would have impacted a small number of users.","The CAP Code required that marketing communications for gambling must not be directed at those aged younger than 18 years through the selection of media or context in which they appeared. The ASA understood that when first using the LiveScore app, users were presented with text which stated, “Please help us […] by selecting the correct age category” and “Livescore carries advertising […] some of this advertising and other content is not suitable for younger members of our audience (for example it may be gambling or alcohol related)”. Below that text, two option boxes stated, “Under 18” and “18 & Over” which could be clicked on to access the app’s homepage. We understood from that text that the app featured two age-based versions which were designed to be different from one another – the under-18 version supposedly not featuring any gambling content or ads whilst the over-18 version featured ads for LiveScore Bet and other gambling operators. We acknowledged Livescore Bet’s view that the majority of LiveScore app users were adults. However, we considered that because there was an option to self-verify as under-18, that version of the app should not have featured gambling ads because those ads, due to the stated target audience, would have been directed at under-18s. We therefore assessed whether the ads appeared in the under-18 version of the app. Ad (a) promoted live odds for LiveScore bet. We acknowledged LiveScore Bet’s view that ad (a) had been viewed on an Android device and that they had been unable to replicate the ad appearing within the under-18 version the app. However, we had seen the ad appear in the under-18 version. Because we had viewed the ad on that version, we considered it had appeared in a medium specifically designed for under-18s and that it had not been appropriately targeted. Ad (b) also promoted live odds for LiveScore Bet, which they acknowledged had been displayed within the under-18 version of the LiveScore app when viewed on IOS devices. Although we acknowledged LiveScore Bet’s view that the ad had been displayed in that version because of a technical problem, we considered that because it appeared in a medium specifically designed for under-18s, it had not been appropriately targeted. Whilst we accepted the ads had been seen because of a technical fault, because the ads appeared in the context of a version of an app that was directed at under-18s, they did not comply with the rules on gambling advertising. The ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 1.3 (Social responsibility), 16.1 and 16.3.13 (Gambling).",The ads must not appear in the under-18 version of the LiveScore app again. We told LiveScore Betting & Gaming (UK) Ltd to ensure their ads were appropriately targeted.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/livescore-betting---gaming--gibraltar--ltd-a25-1274875-livescore-betting---gaming--gibraltar--ltd.html
ASA Ruling on Menwell Ltd t/a Manual,,"A paid-for Google ad seen on 31 January 2025 for Manual, a men’s health treatment provider. The ad stated, “Buy Oral Minoxidil - £14/Month”. Smaller text stated, “Effective in 9/10 Men – The Very Best Treatment in the UK. Proven in Major Studies & Approved By Medical Experts. Book Your Personal Online Consultation”.",The complainant challenged whether the ad breached the Code because it advertised a prescription-only medicine to the public.,Menwell Ltd t/a Manual said they had removed the product from their advertising.,"The CAP Code stated that prescription-only medicines or prescription-only medical treatments must not be advertised to the public. The ad was visible to the general public and stated, “Buy Oral Minoxidil […] Book Your Personal Online Consultation”. We understood from the MHRA that oral minoxidil was a prescription-only medicine and was licensed for the treatment of some types of hypertension only. We considered it was unlikely that this was the indication for which Manual were advertising the medicine to men, and as it was a prescription-only medicine it should, in any case, not have been advertised to the public. We welcomed Manual’s willingness to remove the product from their advertising. However, because the ad promoted a prescription-only medicine to the general public we concluded that it breached the Code. The ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.12 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in the form complained of.

Summary of Council decision: Two issues were investigated, both of which were Upheld.","A post on the health.detective Garstang Health Food Store’s TikTok account was seen on 27 December 2024. The video in the ad featured on-screen text that stated, “This is an impressive cough fix”. The man featured in the video and on-screen text stated, “Hands up who’s got a cough that just won’t go away? Well, here’s a little fix I hope might help you. And I’ve used this successfully with my four year old [sic] daughter who’s had a persistent cough for month after month after month that just won’t go away and we’ve done the things like checking for black mould, giving her all kinds of cough remedies, some of which do ease the symptoms, but this thing, this was amazing. We got an amazing air filter and put it in her bedroom and put it on and that very night she stopped coughing […] it starts to monitor the quality of your air […] delighted that my daughter now sleeps without that awful hacking cough and look here you can get 200 quid off it if you wanna try if for yourself or for your children […] and if you screenshot this QR code […] you’ll get 200 quid off one […] AmazingAir for those nasty nasty coughs”. Text at the bottom of the ad stated, “The AmazingAir filter really is amazing! #coughremedy #cough #airfilter #ionizer fixed my daughters cough the very night we started using it”.",,AirDoctor LLC (AirDoctor) and health.detective Garstang Health Food Store Ltd (health.detective) did not respond to the ASA’s enquiries.,"The ASA was concerned by AirDoctor’s and health.detective’s lack of response and apparent disregard for the Code, which was a breach of CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 1.7 (Unreasonable delay). We reminded them of their responsibility to provide a response to our enquiries and told them to do so in the future. The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such and that they made clear their commercial intent, if that is not obvious from the context. The post featured a QR code that was an affiliate link and by following the link, consumers could purchase the AmazingAir filter. We understood that meant the health.detective account would receive a commission for any click-throughs to the product listing on the AmazingAir website. The post was therefore a marketing communication for the purposes of the Code. We then assessed whether the ad was obviously identifiable as such. We noted that the post did not feature the label “#ad”, or any similar prominent identifier. In the absence of a clear and prominent label, we therefore concluded that the post was not obviously identifiable as a marketing communication and as such breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 2.1 and 2.3 (Recognition of marketing communications). The CAP Code stated that medicinal or medical claims and indications may be made for a medicinal product that is licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, Veterinary Medicines Directorate or under the auspices of the European Medicines Agency, or for a CE-marked medical device and that objective claims must be backed by evidence, if relevant consisting of trials conducted on people. We considered the claims, including “This is an impressive cough fix”, “I’ve used this successfully with my four year old [sic] daughter who’s had a persistent cough for month after month after month that just won’t go away”, “We got an amazing air filter and put it in her bedroom and put it on and that very night she stopped coughing”, “fixed my daughters [sic] cough the very night we started using it” and “delighted that my daughter now sleeps without that awful hacking cough”, were likely to be understood by consumers that the product could treat and prevent coughs. We therefore considered that the ad made medical claims, which required that the product met the requirements for medical devices. We had not seen evidence that the product was registered with the MHRA, nor had we seen evidence that the AmazingAir filter had the appropriate conformity marking. Therefore, no medical claims could be made for the product. Because the ad made such claims, we concluded that it breached the Code. On that point, the ad breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rule 12.1 (Medicines, medical devices, health-related products and beauty products).",The ad must not appear again in its current form. We told health.detective Garstang Health Food Store Ltd and Air Doctor LLC to ensure that in future their ads were obviously identifiable as marketing communications. We further told them not to make medical claims for unlicensed products. We referred the matter to CAP’s Compliance team.,https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/airdoctor-llc-a24-1273039-airdoctor-llc.html
ASA Ruling on Turner Lewis Ltd,"Summary of Council decision: Three issues were investigated, all of which were Upheld.","A TikTok post and a website for Turner Lewis, seen in November 2024: a. A post on the Turner Lewis TikTok account featured a video of a young woman talking about the Government Child Trust Fund scheme. She said, “If you were born after September 2002, and you’re over 18, then there’s a good chance that you’ve got some money waiting for you in the Child Trust Fund, courtesy of the British Government […] if you haven’t claimed yet then don’t worry, because we’ve got your back. Just click the link below to begin your process of locating your Child Trust Fund and, guess what? It’s a no-win, no-fee basis, meaning you’ve got nothing to lose...” A link in Turner Lewis’s TikTok profile led to a landing page. Headline text stated “Ready To Find Your Child Trust Fund? Let’s Get Started!”. Text below featured several boxes which requested personal information. A tick-box near the bottom stated “I confirm and acknowledge that I have read, understood, and agree to the Terms and Conditions of Turner Lewis. I authorise Turner Lewis to act on my behalf to locate my Child Trust Fund and provide the necessary support to access it”. Under that was a box for a signature. b. The website www.turnerlewis.co.uk, included text on the home page which stated “Find Your Child Trust Fund With Turner Lewis […] we offer expert services to help you locate your Child Trust Fund on a no win, no fee basis. Our fee is 25% plus VAT of the total amount in the account”. Smaller text directly below stated “Please be aware that you also have the option to locate your Child Trust Fund for free directly through HMRC. However, our dedicated team has successfully assisted thousands of clients, providing a comprehensive walkthrough, results and peace of mind”. Text further down the page stated “We Achieve Incredible Results For Our Clients […] Turner Lewis specialises in locating Child Trust Funds, we are experts in the regulations and processes associated with such services”. An embedded video repeated claims made on the home page. It also stated “Let us take the hassle out of the process for you. Simply submit your details on our website and we’ll handle the rest […] We reach out to 55 providers, leaving no stone unturned in our quest to locate your fund. While we wait for their replies, you can sit back and relax […] Schedule a 45-minute consultation with us, where we’ll guide you through accessing and withdrawing your funds. This session also helps us gather evidence to adjust our invoice accurately”.",,"1. Turner Lewis Ltd said that the term “you’ve got nothing to lose” was intended to highlight that their service was offered on a “no win, no fee” basis. If they did not locate a client’s Child Trust Fund (CTF), no charge would be levied, so clients would be no worse off than if they hadn’t engaged their services. They thought that prospective clients would understand from the outset that if funds were located, a fee would be charged. They believed that consumers would reasonably understand that they would have to pay a fee for their services. They thought that, while unlikely, if a consumer hadn’t understood from the ad that a fee would be charged for the successful location of a CTF once they had engaged with their website and/or staff, they would have been made aware of the potential fees involved before they had any contractual liability. 2. Turner Lewis believed the ads did not imply that their service would be free. They said ad (a) specifically stated that their service was provided on a “no win, no fee” basis, which they thought made clear that a fee was involved. They accepted that the ad did not specify the terms of the fee, but said they were comprehensively explained in the full terms and conditions, which clients received and were required to sign before engaging their services. Clients needed to tick a box confirming that they had read the terms and conditions before they signed. They rejected the suggestion that the ads portrayed them as a claims management company or that consumers would view them as one. They believed their CTF location service was needed due to what they saw as the failure of HMRC and other providers to provide consumers with an effective, successful way of locating CTFs. Turner Lewis said they were open and transparent about their services, through their ads, website, and terms and conditions. They said they ensured all prospective clients were fully informed about the work they carried out and what they were agreeing to before deciding to use their services. They did not believe their ads presented the process of locating a CTF as more complicated than it actually was, or that consumers would be misled as to the nature of their business model. They believed they were justified in suggesting that it could be easier to locate a CTF using their service because they had built up expertise and relationships with providers, which they said helped them to locate funds faster and more efficiently. They said their website made it clear that consumers could locate a CTF for free using the HMRC tool. They rejected the suggestion that any of the claims or terms highlighted in the complaint would actively deter consumers from exploring their options. 3. Turner Lewis believed that cancellation fees and a 14-day cooling off period were standard terms present in many contracts. They thought they were such common aspects of contracts that consumers would expect that fees would apply in the event of a cancellation outside of the cooling-off period, even if it had not been explicitly referenced in the ads. They also said that the cooling-off period and cancellation fees had been fully explained in the full terms and conditions of their service. Although Turner Lewis accepted that neither ad had made clear upfront that clients would be subject to cancellation fees or a cooling-off period with limitations, they felt that prospective clients had no liability for the cancellation fee until they had read and signed the terms and conditions.","The CAP Code stated that marketing communications must not mislead by omitting material information, hiding it, or presenting it in an untimely manner. The video in ad (a) featured a woman talking about the Government’s CTF scheme. The woman encouraged viewers to “click the link below to begin your process of locating your Child Trust Fund” and included the claim “It’s a no-win, no-fee basis, meaning you’ve got nothing to lose”. The ASA considered that consumers would likely understand from the statement “you’ve got nothing to lose” that there would be no financial impact from using Turner Lewis’s service to locate a CTF. We acknowledged Turner Lewis’s view that the term “you’ve got nothing to lose” intended to highlight that their service was offered on a “no win, no fee” basis, and that people who further engaged with their website or staff would have been made aware of the potential fees they would be charged if Turner Lewis successfully located their CTF. However, we noted that the ad, and the subsequent landing page to which it linked, contained no information regarding the fees Turner Lewis charged if a fund was located, which was 25% plus VAT of the total amount in any account located, capped at £420. While the term “no win, no fee” was likely to be understood to relate to financial services in which a potential charge was dependent on a particular outcome, it was not clear from the ad or the landing page how much any fee might be, how it would be applied, or if it would apply in all circumstances in which a CTF was located. We considered that those factors were material pieces of information a consumer would need to be aware of when deciding whether to engage Turner Lewis’s services. We also noted that neither the ad nor the subsequent landing page included any information informing consumers that there was a free route to trace a CTF via the HMRC website, which we considered was material information which would have had a bearing on someone’s decision to use Turner Lewis’s service. In that context, we considered the phrase “you’ve got nothing to lose” further mislead consumers about the alternative option available to them to trace a CTF for free. Because neither the ad nor the landing page included information about the fees consumers would incur from using Turner Lewis’s services, or the option to trace a CTF for free via the HMRC website, we considered that the ad had misleadingly omitted material information. We therefore concluded that the ad, which included the landing page to which it linked, breached the Code. On that point, ad (a) breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising). The CAP Code required that offers of financial products be set out in a way that allowed them to be understood easily by the audience being addressed, and that they must not take advantage of consumers’ inexperience or credulity. We understood that CTFs were long-term tax-free savings accounts for children born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011. At the time of the complaint, the oldest people who may have had a CTF in their name would have been 22 years old. We therefore considered that the target audience for the ads would, by their nature, likely be younger people who were inexperienced with financial products and offerings. Given that context, we considered it was important for the ads to make the nature of Turner Lewis’s service explicitly clear. Ad (a) included the claim “no win, no fee”, while text in ad (b) stated “locate your Child Trust Fund on a no win, no fee basis”. Ad (b) included the claim that Turner Lewis specialised in locating CTFs and stated that “we are experts in the regulations and processes associated with such services”. The embedded video seen in ad (b) also included the claims “Let us take the hassle out of the process for you” and “we reach out to 55 providers, leaving no stone unturned in our quest to locate your fund”. It also made reference to a “45-minute consultation” session, which the ad claimed helped Turner Lewis “gather evidence to adjust our invoice accurately”. Ad (b) stated that Turner Lewis were experts who specialised in CTFs, from which we considered consumers would understand that the process required specialist knowledge or understanding. The embedded video in ad (b) reinforced that impression, by alluding to the “hassle” associated with the process, and talking about “leaving no stone unturned” in a “quest” to locate a consumer’s CTF. We considered the implied necessity for a “45-minute consultation”, which consumers were likely to view as a long and detailed meeting, further added to that impression. We considered that consumers would likely understand from the presentation of both ads, and the use of language such as “no win, no fee”, that Turner Lewis operated in a similar manner to a claims management service, and that the process of locating and claiming a CTF was a potentially complicated procedure. We understood, however, that consumers could easily locate a CTF themselves for free by submitting a subject access request to HMRC via their website, to identify the account provider of the CTF. We noted that neither ad (a), nor the landing page to which it linked, made any mention of the free route available to consumers to trace a CTF. Ad (b) included smaller text under the main headline text of the page which advised consumers of the free route. That was followed, however, by further text which stated that Turner Lewis’s team had helped thousands of clients, and that their services provided “peace of mind”. We considered this further contributed to the impression that locating a CTF was a complicated process, and that using Turner Lewis’s services was a quicker and more convenient alternative. However, we had seen no evidence that Turner Lewis followed any different processes from those that a consumer would follow themselves, i.e., contacting HMRC via their website. Overall, we considered that both ads created the impression that Turner Lewis operated in similar fashion to a claims management service, when in fact they followed existing, freely available routes to trace a CTF. For the above reasons we concluded that the ads deterred consumers from using the free HMRC tool to locate a CTF and misled consumers about the nature of Turner Lewis’s business model. We also considered that the age range of people eligible for a CTF meant that the ads took advantage of consumers’ inexperience and credulity by suggesting that the process was more complicated than it was, and that engaging Turner Lewis offered advantages over the free route, when that was not the case. For those reasons, we concluded that the ads had breached the Code. On that point, both ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 14.1 (Financial products). The CAP Code stated that when making claims in their advertising, marketers should state any significant limitations or qualifications and must not mislead the consumer by omitting material information. The ads stated that consumers had “nothing to lose”, and that Turner Lewis’s CTF location service operated on a “no win, no fee” basis. The full T&Cs found on another page of their website, however, stated that a cancellation fee of £150 plus VAT may apply if consumers cancelled the service after the cooling-off period during which they could request a refund had ended, or if they breached the client responsibilities as outlined in the T&Cs. The T&Cs also stated that consumers had a 14-day cooling-off period, but that it did not apply if the service had been fully completed within that period. While we acknowledged that the full T&Cs of the service included information about both the cooling-off period and the cancellation fees, neither ad contained any information about those terms. We also noted from Turner Lewis’s response that while the length of time it took for them to complete their location service varied, approximately a third of successful cases had taken less than 14 days to complete, and that CTFs could sometimes be located within 24 hours. We therefore considered that a significant number of cases would see a CTF being located and Turner Lewis’s service being completed well before the cooling-off period had elapsed, meaning that consumers who might have wished to cancel the service within the cooling-off period would have been unable to do so in such circumstances. We considered that the cancellation fee and the cooling-off period, including the information that it would not apply if the service had been completed, were significant qualifications that consumers considering using Turner Lewis’s service should have been made aware of upfront. We therefore considered that both ads had failed to state significant qualifications to Turner Lewis’s service and had misleadingly omitted material information. Both ads therefore breached the Code. On that point, both ads breached CAP Code (Edition 12) rules 3.1 and 3.3 (Misleading advertising), and 3.9 (Qualification).","The ads must not appear again in the form complained about. We told Turner Lewis Ltd to ensure that their future ads did not mislead consumers about the nature of their business, omit material information, or take advantage of consumers’ inexperience and credulity. We also told them to ensure that any significant qualifications were made clear to consumers upfront.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/turner-lewis-ltd-a24-1270072-turner-lewis-ltd.html
ASA Ruling on UAB Convenity t/a Huusk,,"A TV ad for Huusk, a brand of Japanese kitchen knives, was seen on the Sky Cinema Animation channel on 17 February 2025. The ad began with several close-up shots of a knife being used to chop food and slice fruit in half. Similar close-up shots of food being cut was seen throughout the ad, which was three minutes long. A man wearing a bandana around his wrist was seen spinning the knife in his hand. In a later scene, the same man was seen holding the knife which he moved through the air in a slashing motion. He was also seen throwing and slicing a pepper while it was in the air. Another scene showed the knife being used outside in a camping environment to cut sticks before it was stuck into a tree branch. Towards the end of the ad, the knife appeared to be pushed forcibly into a tree trunk. A voiceover, which was heard throughout the ad, stated, “A blend of science, art and tradition. With a design inspired by Japanese knife masters, each Huusk knife embodies more than just a tool. It’s a testament to individuality [...] amazingly sharp and ergonomically designed […] effortlessly slicing food with ease and razor-sharp precision. Huusk cuts through ingredients like a laser […] a knife that’s more than a tool, it’s a legacy for the future.” The ad was cleared by Clearcast without an age-related scheduling restriction.","The complainant, who understood the ad had been shown immediately after a ‘U’ rated animated film, challenged whether the knife was irresponsibly depicted at a time when children would have likely been watching.","UAB Convenity t/a Huusk stated that the purpose of the ad was to highlight the features of the knife, with the kitchen and camping scenes demonstrating its strength, sharpness and versatility. Huusk believed the various scenes which showed the knife being used on food were responsible and that children would have regularly seen food being chopped and sliced at home. They said the knife was not intended to be portrayed in a manner which encouraged violent or irresponsible behaviour and believed none of the scenes featured content which appealed to children. Although they considered the content of the ad to be responsible, Huusk acknowledged that it should not have been broadcast immediately after a film which was likely to have been viewed by a high number of children. They explained that they held that view because the product was not intended to appeal to children, which they said meant that the ad’s scheduling should have been more carefully considered. Huusk acknowledged they were responsible for the selection of time slots and TV channels where the ad was broadcast. However, they believed they did not have control over the finalised scheduling of the ad. More specifically, they said the ability to prevent the ad being broadcast immediately following a children’s film was out of their control. They confirmed that no age-related scheduling restriction was issued by Clearcast and said they would ensure all future ads depicted the knife in a safe and responsible manner. Clearcast said the purpose of the ad was to showcase the product’s quality, its ease of use and the versatility of how it could be used in a variety of settings. However, they acknowledged some of the scenes could have appealed to children and believed they could have undermined the efforts of parents and schools to educate young people about the dangers of knives. They said they did not anticipate that Huusk would have wanted to schedule the ad after a film which children were likely to have been watching, but that they would consider adding a scheduling restriction so that it could not be broadcast around programmes principally directed at or likely to appeal to children. Sky said they relied on Clearcast signalling an ad’s appropriateness through use of their restrictions. They said that because the ad was not given an age-related scheduling restriction, it was scheduled accordingly, and they had no reason to suspect there was an issue with its content. They said that if Clearcast had believed that the product was unsuitable for broadcast around a film that children were likely to have been watching, then they would have expected an ex-kids restriction to have been applied.","The BCAP Code stated that relevant timing restrictions must be applied to ads that, through their content, might harm or distress children of particular ages or that are otherwise unsuitable for them. The ad was cleared without an age-related scheduling restriction that would have prevented it from being broadcast in or around programmes made for, or specifically targeted at, children (an ex-kids restriction). Consequently, it was broadcast immediately after the U rated film ‘Hotel Transylvania Two’, which meant the ad was shown at a time when children would have likely been watching. We acknowledged that because the purpose of the ad was to promote the Huusk kitchen knife, it was understandable that it would feature the product being used to showcase its performance and versatility. However, since the ad was not targeted away from children, we considered that it should not have featured imagery and dialogue that depicted the knife in a way which risked children emulating its use, in a way that would be unsafe. We considered that the ad featured a number of scenes of the knife being handled in a manner which went beyond the safe and typical use of a kitchen knife. That included a scene where a man, who had a bandana on his wrist, put his finger through a hole in the knife before he spun it on his hand. The following scene showed fruit being cut almost perfectly in half in one quick and instantaneous slicing motion. In a later scene, the man moved the knife through the air in a slashing motion which we considered was reminiscent of how ninjas were often depicted in children’s media. The man then threw an item of food in the air, and in another sudden, slicing motion, cut the food in half while it was still airborne. We considered that those scenes went beyond the safe and typical use of a kitchen knife, and if emulated by children, could have resulted in them being harmed. Throughout those scenes, the man was presented as performing complex skills which we considered children would have understood as being similar to a ninja and that those scenes would have also appealed to them. We considered, particularly in light of the appeal to children, some children may seek to emulate the scenes in the ad, thereby placing themselves at risk of harm. Another scene showed the knife being forcibly stuck into tree branches, which went beyond the typical and safe use of a kitchen knife, in a way that could seem exciting to children. We considered that scene could have caused them to emulate such behaviour and result in them being harmed. We considered that describing a knife as a ‘laser’, while also showing it spinning on someone’s hand and slicing food, presented the product as having exaggerated toy-like qualities which would have resonated with children and, again, could have resulted in harmful emulation. We considered adults would have understood that those scenes featured the knife being used in an unrealistic setting and that it would have been unsafe for someone who was not professionally trained in handling knives to emulate. In contrast, we considered some children were likely to have been excited by the knife’s depiction in the scenes, which could cause them to emulate the behaviour shown, putting them at risk of harm. We concluded that, to minimise the risk of children seeing it, the ad should have been given an ex-kids timing restriction. We therefore concluded that the scheduling of the ad was irresponsible and breached the Code. The ad breached BCAP Code rules 1.2 (Social responsibility), 5.2 (Children), 32.1 and 32.3 (Scheduling).","The ad must not be broadcast again in its current form without an appropriate scheduling restriction to ensure it is not broadcast in or around programmes made for, or specifically targeted at, children.",https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/uab-convenity-a25-1281612-uab-convenity.html
