Jim Carrey Attends Fashion Week Party Just to Roast Fashion Week Parties
2017-09-11
Jim Carrey, once an actor, now an artiste, and cultural commenter, stopped by New York Fashion Week to neg it. E! News’s Catt Sadler caught up with Carrey on the red carpet of the Harper’s Bazaar Icons party Friday night, and the two-minute clip of their exchange has been percolating on Twitter ever since. After she pointed out that she’d never seen him at the biannual spectacle, he explained to her the following: “There’s no meaning to any of this. So I wanted to find the most meaningless thing that I could come to and join and here I am.” Watch Sadler’s eyes as she fully comprehends what she’s about to endure.

“Celebrating icons,” Carrey says. “Boy, that is just the absolute lowest aiming possibility we could come up with. Do you believe in icons?”

When Sadler started to answer, he interjected, “I don’t believe in personalities. I don’t believe that you exist, but there is a wonderful fragrance in the air.”

Carrey then looked in the camera and gave his speech, “I don’t believe in icons. I don’t believe in personalities. I believe that peace lies beyond personalities, beyond invention and disguise, beyond the red ‘S’ that you wear on your chest, that makes bullets bounce off. I believe that it’s deeper than that. I believe we’re a field of energy dancing for itself, and—uh—I don’t care.” (It wasn’t exactly extemporaneous poetry; the lines are borrowed from a commencement speech he gave in 2014 at Iowa’s Maharishi University of Management).

Yes, he sounded like a liberal-arts student on a particularly mellow week night. And it’s not clear whether he sensed the irony in himself saying all of that while attending the party and wearing a flashy tailored suit (Asked about his get-up, he said, “I didn’t get dressed up. There is no me. There’s just things happening.”).

Carrey’s referendum, despite its slightly unbearable pitch, rings somewhat true amid the backdrop of destruction caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. And Charlottesville. And the general mood of melancholy that has settled over the country like a thick fog. It’s hard to see where the art and commercialism and spectacle of N.Y.F.W. fits into all that. Designers themselves have struggled with that question since the 2016 election, as have many creators in other fields. The world looks different now than it did even last February, and it will somersault a thousand more times before the clothing parade gears again up next February. (But, make no mistake, the parade will go on.)

But that’s not even it, really, Carrey said. “It’s not our world. We don’t matter. That’s the good news.” Great!

I posted a thread about Donny on WP:ANI  on Saturday after he 1) accused me of WP:BITE and then 2) demanded checkuser to clear his name.  I thought that took some nerve, since I haven't run across any newbies who were so conversant with checkuser, but checkuser isn't employed to establish innocence.  In any case, a passing checkuser confirmed that Donny evaded 3RR using IP's.  Whether or not the IP that raised the Iberian/Arabian issue was Donny is probably beside the point - there's no possibility of AGF with Donny anymore.

2689,"'Please make babies!' Fans go into overdrive as they beg Prince Harry to DATE Rihanna after the pair meet in Barbados (but what about Meghan?)

Prince Harry, 32, met Rihanna this week during a visit to Barbados 
Pair were pictured laughing and joking together at a special concert 
Songstress was seen teasing Harry when they volunteered for HIV tests
Fans on social media have called for them to start dating and 'have babies'
Harry is dating Meghan Markle while Rihanna is rumoured to be single 


They locked eyes for the first time just two days ago, but fans are already angling for Prince Harry and Rihanna to get together.

Harry, who is dating Suits actress Meghan Markle, joined forces with the Bajan beauty in Barbados this week as part of his 15-day tour of the Caribbean, and the pair were pictured laughing and joking together.

Within minutes of the images appearing online, fans had taken to Instagram to remark on the couple's chemistry and beg them to become a couple.

As well as teaming up for a series of celebratory events to mark the country's 50th anniversary of independence, the pair both volunteered for HIV tests to highlight World Aids Day yesterday.

And fans could barely contain their excitement, with a video of the pair posted online notching up almost 23,000 likes and hundreds of comments.

Instagrammer belledbel wrote: 'Please make babies,' while katytaylor added, 'I know harry is already dating a wonderfully beautiful girl but how about this for a perfect couple!'

Others commented on the 'cute' pairing with courtleigh8 calling them a 'match made in heaven'.

Rihanna, 28, is rumoured to be newly-single after splitting from Canadian rapper and on-off boyfriend Drake, while Harry is well and truly taken.

Commenting beneath a video of the pair together on Kensington Palace's Instagram page, rieyelisa wrote: 'Ummm yes I fully support this union.'

Mallies went as far as saying they'd make 'the cutest babies' with adore_echelon gushing: 'You guys look stunning together oh my goshh.'

One fan declared she would be 'OK if they dated' while Pakittyy remarked: 'RiRi Royalty!'

However not everyone was convinced, with twittyj blasting: 'RiRi & Harry together? No thanks. She's a very talented lady, but not quite princess material. Pop princess, perhaps.'

Harry met the songstress for the first time on Wednesday and it seems the pair became fast friends as, following their meet in the afternoon, enjoyed an evening at a concert together.

Rihanna joined the royal for a Golden Anniversary Spectacular Mega Concert at the Kensington Oval Cricket Ground the following evening.

Their visit marked the royal's tenth day of his two week official visit to the Caribbean.

With his visit to Barbados coming to an end Harry looked determined to make the most of his evening with the Diamonds singer.

The royal looked dapper in a pair of wine coloured chinos which he paired with a navy shirt for the event.

Harry is nearing the end of his 15-day tour of the Caribbean which has so far taken him to St Kitt's and Nevis, Grenada and St Lucia. He will finish in Guyana with a special visit to the country's President David Granger.

2831,"Ariel Winter Celebrates One-Year Anniversary With Boyfriend Levi Meaden

Ariel Winter celebrated her one-year anniversary with boyfriend Levi Meaden on Sunday, November 12, posting a sweet love note on Instagram.

“Happy 1 year anniversary my love,” she captioned two pics with her beau. “I’m the luckiest girl in the entire world. Thank you for being the incredible man you are, and for making me the happiest I could’ve ever imagined. Here’s to many, many more. I love you. P.S. your crazy butt is the only one who could ever make me agree to jumping off a cliff at a waterfall soooo yeah. I love you.”

Happy 1 year anniversary my love. I’m the luckiest girl in the entire world. Thank you for being the incredible man you are, and for making me the happiest I could’ve ever imagined. Here’s to many, many more. I love you. ❤️ P.S. your crazy butt is the only one who could ever make me agree to jumping off a cliff at a waterfall soooo yeah. I love you.

The first pic showed them in their red carpet finest, while the second photo featured her in a pink bikini with her legs wrapped around Meaden, 30, as they kissed near a waterfall.

The Aftermath star posted his own tribute to the Modern Family actress, 19, writing, “I can’t believe it’s been a year. We’ve had adventures. Gotten dolled up countless times. And traveled through 3 continents together. I never imagined I’d be this happy. I love you more than anything! Happy anniversary Peanut Butter!!!!”

Earlier this week Winter dished to Us Weekly about Meaden, saying that they “have a great relationship.”

“He’s just the loveliest person, he loves me through thick and thin,” she told Us. “He’s always telling me, no matter what I’m wearing, no matter what I’m doing, that I’m beautiful.”

The couple live together in L.A. in a house that Winter bought last year.

“My boyfriend and I live together, and he cooks,” she told Jimmy Kimmel this past May. “I can’t cook at all. He takes care of all that handy stuff. He’s great, he does all that. I can bake a pie occasionally. Pumpkin and apple. I baked those two the other day. They were edible.”

I am coming late to this but I am unaware of any Muslim group that rejects Khadija as the first convert. The story of Muhammad's reception of the first revelation and his immediate flight in terror to hide weeping beneath Khadija's robe is a beloved tradition. While the authenticity of the many ahaadith is debated, this event is considered a crucial part of his revelation. I think the introduction """"According to Muslim traditions"""" perfectly suits this situation, given that the event is only recorded by Muslims.

I would be interested if anyone knows of a competing tradition, because admittedly this is not my speciality.

1373,"Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what Ultra.Power says it is, not your correction. It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless.

You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values. However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e. So let's do that.

We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible. We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0.

To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1).

And we want f to be continuously differentiable. (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0). This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e.)

Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1]. From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1). Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! 

Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x])).

Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0.",0

Find out the ins and outs of the allege­d 'love story' here

Following a bitter break-up from actress Angelina Jolie, rumours surfaced suggesting Fight Club star Brad Pitt to have moved on. That too, with a princess – Princess Charlotte Casiraghi of Monaco to be specific, reported Australian magazine New Idea.

The two allegedly made their public appearance as a couple last week as they attended a Los Angeles Country Museum of Art event together, the magazine further reported.

Angelina Jolie: Brad Pitt is ‘terrified’ that the truth will come out

“No one could believe it when we saw them together,” sources told the magazine. They continued, “There have been rumours circulating for weeks that Brad has moved on with a new woman but no one was ready to see him hand-in-hand with royalty from Monaco.”

31-year old Charlotte and Brad were seemingly introduced to each another by Brad’s Allied co-star and good friend Marion Cotillard as she is very close friends with Charlotte. Marion, who Brad has previously been linked with, was keen for him to find happiness after Brad’s messy split with Angelina.

Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie

However, Gossip Cop has called the Australian magazine out on this story and went on to ‘set the record straight’. Gossip Cop is a website that patrols the celebrity gossip industry in search of discrediting untrue rumours.

Not only are the actor and royal not dating, she isn’t even a princess, reported the online platform. Charlotte is the daughter of Princess Caroline of Hanover and is not a princess herself. She is the granddaughter of actress turned Princess Grace Kelly.

After checking in with Brad himself, Gossip Cop went on to state that the actor exclusively assured them that he and Charlotte are not in a relationship. New Idea’s article regarding the non-existent relationship was simply bogus.

Hope that we feel this.. feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
but you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
on the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too long
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything is cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, 
and graduation

CHORUS:
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson [OOOH]

2562,"Ellen DeGeneres Is Now In The Middle Of Kelly Ripa And Michael Strahan’s Feud After Segment On Her Show

It is a known fact that there is bad blood between Kelly Ripa and her former co-chair, Michael Strahan, and now Ellen DeGeneres is caught in the middle.

Last month, the host of The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Strahan sat down for a silly segment.

The two popular TV personalities tackled various topics. The episode was well received, and the millions of people who watched it saw nothing out of the ordinary.

However, according to sources, who spoke to Star, Portia de Rossi’s wife is having what would be considered as buyer’s remorse.

It is being claimed that the host of LIVE did not appreciate DeGeneres’ having her nemesis on the show.

According to the the the publication, Ripa felt betrayed by DeGeneres whom she considered as a friend.

Aware that she got on Ripa’s nerves, DeGeneres has allegedly reached out and apologized for the mistake.

It is not known if Ripa has accepted such apology nor if the ladies have been able to amend their friendship.

The former American football defensive end and Ripa were the co-hosts of Live! with Kelly and Michael from 2012 to 2016.

In spring 2016, he abruptly left the show to join ABC morning television show, Good Morning America.

The ex-athlete was slammed on numerous occasions by Ripa who said she was furious over Strahan’s decision to dump her without warning.

Strahan hit back by stating: “The most disappointing thing to me was that I was painted as the bad guy because I value the way I carry myself. I do not want people to see me as ‘Oh, he just ran out, just left them there.’ That is just not true.”

Strahan confirmed that they no longer talk.

In a past interview, he said: “At one point I think we were friends. I do not know what happened at the end. I learned a lot from her, though.”

He added: “I was not surprised by her reaction at all, but I cannot control somebody else’s actions. I was there four years, and it is about more than just being in front of the camera.”

An article recently appeared on BET, where an insider said Strahan wants to have a sit-down with Ripa.

The source revealed: “Michael is 100% behind meeting with Kelly and clearing the air. These two were TV-husband-and-wife for many years and to go from seeing someone five days a week to having zero contact makes no sense to him. Through mutual friends, Michael has made it clear that he would love to set up drinks or a private meeting with Kelly.”

It is being claimed Ripa has turned him down.

2796,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are Auctioning Off a Dinner Date

Ever wanted to discuss whether both Jack and Rose could have fit on that raft with the actual Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet ? Well, you're in luck. At least if you've got some money on hand and are feeling generous.

Twenty years after their tragic onscreen love story ended, the Titanic costars are reuniting for a good cause: At this year's Auction Gala, hosted by the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, one lucky bidder will have the chance to have a private dinner with Jack and Rose—erm, Leo and Kate—at the NYC restaurant of their choosing sometime in October or November, People reports .

The star-studded event is set to take place in St. Tropez on July 26, and proceeds from the dinner and auction will go to support environmental causes via the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. According to People , last year's gala raised $45 million, and the Foundation has reportedly donated over $80 million in environmental grants since its conception in 2008. Proceeds from the dinner with DiCaprio and Winslet, specifically, will also be put toward the Golden Hat Foundation, which benefits children with autism and their families, and a GoFundMe campaign that Winslet is involved with that's attempting to raise money to help a young mother in the U.K. afford cancer treatment.

In addition to getting the chance to bid on dinner with the greatest doomed onscreen couple of our time, gala guests will be treated to a special performance by Lenny Kravitz. According to a statement from the Gala, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo will also be in attendance to receive the ""New World Leadership Award"" in honor of her “innovative approach to making Paris a model for sustainable urban living and design,” People adds.

If last year's guest roster was any indication, the invite list rivals the likes of the Met Gala and the Academy Awards. Past attendees have included Bono, Chris Rock, Mariah Carey, Tobey Maguire, Jonah Hill, Naomi Campbell, Bradley Cooper, and Edward Norton. And according to E!, this year's list of chairpeople for the event includes Madonna, Cate Blanchett, Emma Stone, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hanks, Jared Leto, Penélope Cruz, and Kate Hudson, among others.

For anyone who didn't make the invite list (or doesn't have hundreds of thousands of dollars to shell out on a single dinner) but still wants the chance to sit next to DiCaprio, try your luck at flights from Los Angeles to St. Tropez: Word on the street is that he's flying commercial to the event.

2699,"Victoria Beckham finally addresses claims she's trying for her FIFTH baby at 42 with husband David

The famous couple, who live in London, already have three sons and a daughter

Victoria Beckham has finally addressed claims she is set to try for another baby at the age of 42.

It has been widely reported that David is keen to add to their brood, which includes sons Brooklyn, 17, Romeo, 13, and Cruz, 11, along with their adorable four-year-old daughter Harper.

The footballing legend , 41, told chat show host Jonathan Ross in 2012: ""We might have one more or two more, you never know.

""We're not thinking about it yet, but if it happens, great. We're enjoying the kids 

 as it is. It's always a thought.

""I mean, we're busy people and we're enjoying the four kids that we've got already and we're lucky, we're lucky to have four healthy children.""

Sources close to the star even previously claimed she was preparing for pregnancy and had boosted her already spinach-heavy diet with ""broccoli and leafy greens rich in folic acid"".

But VB has now spoken out to Sunday Times Style Magazine , insisting she is NOT trying for another baby and doesn't want any more children.

She said: ""No! I am done. People have been obsessed with it - she's getting divorced, she's pregnant, she's getting divorced, she's pregnant - ever since I met David.""

Victoria admitted her kids get harder to handle as they get older - but the most important thing is to make sure that each child in the family gets the individual attention they need.

The star explained: ""I can never go to bed early because Brooklyn is always up and that's when I get to see him, and then you've got Harper who is up super early.

""So I do feel the that I'm being pulled in four different directions with the children. And then I have David and work, too. The truth is, it is hard.""

The fashion designer, who went on to build her own empire after her success with the Spice Girls, admits she feels guilty if she misses something with the children, but it's not something that happens often.

She added that her and David are ""always cuddling"" their kids, they communicate constantly and are very present in their lives, never missing a parents' evening or sports day.

Reply from ColonelHenry
I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?
 First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical """"rule nazi"""" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly """"this user is an asshole"""" and explain why and state """"this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"""" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say """"asshole"""" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a """"dick"""" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.
 In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to """"wait until after TFA"""" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize """"hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.
 And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's """"Will to Power"""" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.

As for why, I like """"nineteenth"""" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for """"brevity's sake"""" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to """"kick rocks.""""

As far as I'm concerned, this is over. Move on. I am not addressing this any further, because nonsense like this keeps me from contributing and convinces me to leave Wikipedia again, and this time for good. If Hell is other people, Wikipedia constantly proves itself to be the eighth and ninth circle.   """,1

Has Megyn Kelly gotten plastic surgery?

The TV star sparked rumors she's gone under the knife after her first-ever Today appearance on Thursday, June 1.



Rumors have previously circulated that the TV star may have gotten Botox, a nose job, and maybe even breast implants. However, Megyn, 46, has never addressed the talk that she's gotten procedures done throughout her career.


However, surgeons have exclusively weighed in on the topic to Closer Weekly! Dr. Andrew Miller suggests, ""I don't see anything other than possibly a little Botox for the forehead and crow’s feet.

Dr. Mardirossian adds that she may have gotten Botox to the forehead, a rhinoplasty, and filler to her cheeks, lips, nasolabial folds, and possibly to her jawline.

Megyn isn't only making headlines for her changing face! During her NBC debut, she seemingly snubbed Today co-host Hoda Kotb — and who knows if she even realized she did it!



After Matt Lauer congratulated Megyn on joining the team (he was sitting next to Hoda and Savannah Guthrie), Megyn said back, ""Hey guys, it's great to be with you, Matt and Savannah."" What about Hoda?! So awkward!

Forget ""Pearl Harbor"" – Hollywood is buzzing about a true-life scandal involving the paternity of the $140 million blockbuster's director, Michael Bay.

Finally addressing rumors that have circulated for years, legendary director John Frankenheimer admitted he had a one-night stand with the adopted Bay's birth mother, who claimed he was Bay's dad – and that he paid her off.

But Frankenheimer denied ""absolutely, categorically"" that he is the younger director's father.

""We had tests done, and I am not his father,"" Frankenheimer told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published yesterday.

Bay, 37, who's in Honolulu for the premiere of ""Pearl Harbor,"" declined to respond to the bombshell revelation.

""It's a private matter,"" Bay said of the story – which Frankenheimer, 71, unleashed just five days before the release of ""Pearl Harbor,"" one of the summer's most highly anticipated movies.

The older director said his ""one-night stand"" with Bay's birth mom – who was not identified – happened at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel while he was making ""Seven Days in May"" in 1963.

Months later, Frankenheimer got a call from his lawyer, the late Frank Wells, who said the woman was pregnant – and had named Frankenheimer as the father.

""I asked Wells, 'What can we do?'"" said Frankenheimer, who feared a scandal would hurt his career. ""We can pay her off,"" the director quoted Wells as advising him. So Frankenheimer paid the mother $7,500, and says he ""didn't hear anything more about this"" until 16 years ago.

By the mid-1980s, Bay, adopted and raised by Jimmy and Harriet Bay in L.A.'s Westwood section, was an aspiring filmmaker trying to find his birth parents.

""I [did] a little investigation,"" Bay told the Times. ""I found [my mom] in three days.""

Then Frankenheimer got a call from the woman's lawyer.

""He said there is a young man at Wesleyan University, and he wants to find out who his real parents are,"" Frankenheimer recalled.

2773,"'Second Act' Cast Stars Milo Ventimiglia & Jennifer Lopez & No One Can Control Their Emotions

Get ready for one of the hottest movie couples ever... and it's a pretty unexpected one, too! TV heartthrob Milo Ventimiglia just signed on to Jennifer Lopez's upcoming romantic comedy, Second Act, and it sounds like we're going to see some sparks fly between them. Milo Ventimiglia will play J. Lo's boyfriend in the new movie, according to Variety, and the casting news has fans of the two stars shook.

Milo Ventimiglia will be playing the longtime boyfriend of Jennifer Lopez's character in Second Act, which is slated to come out next year. We don't know much about Ventimiglia's character yet, but the movie will be about Lopez's character reinventing her life, starting out as a Costco employee who uses her street smarts to make it big on Madison Avenue. Leah Remini will play the best friend of Lopez's character, and Vanessa Hudgens is also attached to play an executive at a consumer goods company. Other cast members include Freddie Stroma (UnREAL, Harry Potter), Dan Bucatinsky (Scandal), and Annaleigh Ashford (Masters of Sex).

This will be the first time Milo Ventimiglia and Jennifer Lopez have ever worked together on a project, which makes it all the more exciting for fans to see these super buzzy stars team up and play boyfriend and girlfriend on-screen. Just call them J-Milo. Or Mi-Lo. Maybe just Milo & J. Lo? I know there's a good couple name in there somewhere!

Although they've never worked together, Milo Ventimiglia and Jennifer Lopez actually have gotten to know one another better over the past year after both stars began helming their respective NBC series — Ventimiglia stars as the deceased father Jack Pearson on This Is Us and Lopez stars as police officer Harlee Santos on Shades of Blue. The two were photographed together at an NBC event back in March, and Lopez has even come out as a massive fan of Ventimiglia's show This Is Us. A couple months ago, she and her boyfriend Alex Rodriguez recreated a scene from the show in which Milo's character Jack did push-ups with his son Randall. Earlier this month, Milo's co-star Chrissy Metz said she was so surprised when she learned Jennifer Lopez was a major fan of the series.

It's safe to say J. Lo isn't the only massive Milo Ventimiglia fan out there. Twitter erupted in excitement after new of the casting broke on Wednesday afternoon. Check out some of the best responses below:

Although, I guess if you're a hardcore This Is Us fan, it may be hard to see Jack Pearson making out with J. Lo and not Rebecca (Mandy Moore). Second Act will be Milo Ventimiglia's first major motion picture in the romantic comedy genre since reemerging to TV fame in This Is Us. He first came to fame as another romantic lead: the small-town bad boy Jess Mariano in Gilmore Girls. His other major TV role between those two was as the paramedic-turned-superhero Peter Petrelli in the NBC drama Heroes.

Jennifer Lopez is best known for being the international pop star behind some of the biggest Top 40 songs of the 2000s, but she's also cultivated a respected career as an actress thanks to movies like Selena, Out Of Sight, and Maid in Manhattan. She currently stars in the crime drama Shades of Blue, and will star in NBC's next live musical: Bye Bye Birdie Live!

The news of Milo Ventimiglia and Jennifer Lopez playing boyfriend and girlfriend is exciting, but unfortunately fans are going to have to wait a while before they can see the on-screen couple together. Second Act is set to come out sometime in 2018, and since it sounds like they're just beginning the filming process now, it probably won't be until towards the end of the year.

2863,"Gwen Stefani Shockingly Ruptures Eardrum & Is Forced To Cancel Show — Is She Okay?

Poor Gwen Stefani! The singer shockingly ruptured her eardrum and was forced to cancel an April 27 concert in Las Vegas because of her medical emergency. This is so scary. Is Gwen’s hearing going to be okay?


Gwen Stefani, 47, went through a terrifying ordeal on April 25 when her eardrum ruptured while on a flight. The painful injury landed Gwen in Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where doctors told her not to fly anywhere or sing until it gets healed. The brutal injury came at exactly the wrong time for Gwen. She was supposed to sing at the Power f Love gala in Las Vegas just two days later.

The pop star/The Voice judge had to bow out of the prestigious event at the MGM Grand where she was set to perform a 30-minute live set, because of her limitations. That’s so awful! Guests at the event, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, were told about the cancellation right before the event. Gwen recorded a short apology video that was played for the guests and gala honorees: “I am so sorry that I cannot attend tonight, But I wanted to send a message of congratulations to Andre Agassi and my dear friend Ronald Pearlman,” Gwen said.

The event hosted by the Keep Memory Alive charity to help find cures for memory and movement disorders, honored the tennis legend with the Community Leadership Award, and honored Ronald for his “outstanding philanthropy.” While attendees were bummed that they couldn’t see Gwen’s set, they got an incredible replacement: Jennifer Hudson! There’s No Doubt that Jennifer tore the house down!

Luckily, Gwen’s doing okay. She was still on The Voice this week and looked happy! A ruptured eardrum is no small deal, though. It occurs when a small perforation pops in the eardrum, sometimes from trauma, ear infection, loud noises, surgery, or flying in a plane with a severe cold. You know how your ears pop in a plane? It’s like that, but way worse. It can lead to temporary hearing loss, or ringing in the ears.

It’s unclear how severe Gwen’s eardrum is injured, but the healing process can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, and in some very rare cases, years.

HollywoodLifers, we hope Gwen feels better! Send her your positive get-well vibes in the comments!

Since Neturalhomer chooses to edit his User Talk page to erase the past, I will post the relevant exchange here (he gave """"removing vandalism"""" as the reason for editing it out; his only tool is a hammer, perhaps, so he sees me as a nail, perhaps)

Your Lie(s) About Me

You wrote: """"Final Warning

Saying things like """"DC101 IS HIS FUCKING EMPLOYER!!!"""" and """"Don't be a douche"""" is a good way to get blocked....fast. Tone the language down...and pay attention. Greaseman ain't dead. If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia, I will report you to AIV and to your ISP, Verizon. Stop now, this is your final warning. - NeutralHomer • Talk """"

Yes, I did use the language (on a talk page) and if it will make the booboo feel better, I apologize. But who doesn't enjoy a nice summer's eve?

BUT, you need to STOP LYING about me. I never said the Greaseman was dead, only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated, Eve. Otherwise, perhaps it is I who shall report you. Tell you what: you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed. Fair?

Let's look at your odd writing style: """"If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia,"""" Just what are you going for there?

I've never put a lie on Wikipedia, contrary to your assertion. Anyone who lies about me can go screw.

Your threat to report me to my ISP (FOR WHAT, EVE?) is beyond pathetic. Two pops for yes!! Report away.

Now, the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters.  He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion.

Let's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD.  There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute.  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD.  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did.  THAT IS A LIE.  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines.  Is this a """"separate but equal"""" or """"separate and unequal"""" system?

The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio.  Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we?  There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not?  Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism?

The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part.

To recap: I never lied.  I never vandalized.  That should be enough.

Now let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we?  Sensitive matters, no?

Personal life

Romero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2]

Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime.

Romero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a """"confirmed bachelor."""" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime.

Romero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: """"Butch."""" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: """"You're so butch!"""" While Romero's homosexuality was an """"open secret"""" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years.

Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood",1

George Clooney's upcoming nuptials to fiancee Amal Alamuddin is turning out to be disastrous - a prenup the couple has been arguing over, worries about a guest list feud and their wedding planner quitting - and the couple might not even make it down the aisle!

A new report from The National ENQUIRER claims the Hollywood playboy has been negotiating and ""fighting"" with soon-to-be wife's legal team over a $220 million wedding contract.

""Clooney is worth an estimated $220 million. Given his shaky track record with women over the years, including a difficult divorce from his first wife and the brief longevity of most Hollywood marriages in general, I think he needs to make sure he has a prenuptial agreement that's ironclad,"" divorce attorney Raoul L. Felder told The ENQUIRER.

""He has a lot to worry about and a lot to lose if he doesn't proceed with the utmost care and caution. The fact that (his fiancee) is a lawyer is strike one against him. I expect his lawyers are being very careful and 'fighting' her lawyers over every point.""

Indeed, Alamuddin's intellect and successful career was an attraction for Clooney, but now it may work against him.

Adding tension to the Lake Como ceremony is an old scandal surrounding one of Clooney's best buddies, Brad Pitt - his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston and current partner Angelina Jolie.

""At first she was on the fence about going,"" the source said of Jolie, ""because she's not big on schmoozing at Hollywood get-togethers. But she quickly changed her mind after George told her that President Obama RSVP'd 'Yes'!""

Pitt was going with or without her, the source noted, and Aniston also remains confirmed on the guest list.

""George is extremely concerned that by inviting both these women, they'll undoubtedly try to upstage each other and in doing so take the spotlight off the bride,"" the insider told the magazine.

And the third strike? Their wedding planner quit because of location confusion causing complete disarray.

Again, I disagree. Scholarly consensus has been moving towards the direction of inclusiveness (particularly for the question of the Roma and the disable).

The famous pictures of Mengele's twins are of Roma children. The technology and expertise for mass murder was developed for the disable in the T4. The tactics of Eisengruppen were first developed in the invasion of Poland, against Polish leaders. I have seen several good arguments that convinced me of the centrality of Jews in the Holocaust; I have never seen a convincing argument for their exclusivity.
If this is not enough, let me try in another way: by deciding to describe the Holocaust as an 'exclusive' Jewish event, wikipedia is taking sides in a ongoing scholarly debate (I could say on the 'declining' side of an ongoing scholarly debate). this is NOT holocaust denial, with no legitimacy in the academia, and it must receive more than mere lip service in the body of the text or in the footnotes.

Does Drake's New Single Mean He's Already Done With His Most Recent Album?

Just over one week ago, Drake surprised the world by announcing a new single was on its way, and then by dropping said track just a few days later in the middle of a Louis Vuitton runway show in Paris. For those who didn’t get an invite to the exclusive event, “Signs” was uploaded to Spotify shortly thereafter, and since then it's been streamed millions of times and discussed at length across social channels.

The new Drake track sounds like it could be the next big hit for the hip-hop superstar, who obviously wants to own the summer in the same way he did last year with his first No. 1 hit as a lead artist, “One Dance.” “Signs” has yet to hit the Hot 100, but it will in a short time, and it could grant the rapper another serious smash.

Many people have started wondering what the release of this new poppy offering means for Drake, who is only a few months removed from his last chart-topping effort on the Billboard 200. As always, he has been mum on the subject, but there is plenty of precedent in his past to suggest that a new collection could already be in the works from the biggest name in music.

Over the past few years, Drake has sped up his release schedule, and he never allows much time to pass in between one album and the next (or whatever he’s calling them these days). He dropped two mixtapes in 2015, an album in 2016 and less than a year later in March 2017, his playlist project More Life topped the albums tally with ease. All of those items were massive moments in music and successful in terms of sales and especially streams, and while he could have kept them alive and promoted them more intensely, Drake doesn’t seem concerned with the shelf life of his music, instead focusing his energy on creating more and more content.

It might only be a few months old, but the superstar Grammy winner seems to have already moved on from More Life, even though it remains inside the top 10 on the Billboard week after week. He hasn’t gone out of his way to do much in the way of promotion, and while every track featured on the collection initially charted on the Hot 100, only two have managed to hold on, and neither is currently residing inside the top 40 any longer.

Drake also has a habit of mixing timelines and pushing more than one project simultaneously, which would likely be disastrous for any other artist. Back in July 2015, he unleashed “Hotline Bling,” which would quickly go on to become one of his highest-charting efforts and something of a signature song. Just a few months later, he and Future dropped their collaborative mixtape What A Time To Be Alive, which confusingly didn’t feature “Bling.” That song wouldn’t end up on a collection until nine months later, when Views finally conquered the world. The name Drake turned out to be powerful enough to keep both the song going and to send What A Time To Be Alive to the top of the Billboard 200 without issue, so now he knows he can balance two different projects at once.

At the moment, “Signs” is currently being pushed as a standalone single, but in Drake’s world, that could change in a moment. Depending on how well it performs on the charts and how long it is able to last, it could wind up serving as the lead cut from an upcoming album, or mixtape, or playlist project or anything really. Drake has established himself as not only one of the most successful artists of all time, but also one of the most unpredictable, which is what is required by today’s fast-paced music industry.

Hello Barto. I am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the Ron Gostick page and are you the creator of it?  As stated on the talk page there, you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left.  These are terms both I and Ron, himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the Canadian League of Rights. I could explain why here, but I won't bore you with the details.

However, I do reject the notion that everything must link to a Wiki article.  I am editing at another page, where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. I will not object to so-called Left or Right sources, as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to Mr. Gostick.  The archives at the Australian League of Rights will have plenty of published materials on him, League objectives and views or anyone associated with him. This is one link that was removed in favor of David Lethbridge's document (hardly a non-politcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what Gostick and the League of Rights stood for).

I will try to help you find sources, fair and credible in the near future, doing edits myself.  I just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him.  I know well what he and the League of Rights stand for, as I have been involved with it for near 30 yrs. There is no denying he was anti-totalitarianism and that includes anti-zionist, which automatically brings down the bogus smear of """"anti-semitism' and other such nonsense.  An editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.

I have notified Paul Fromm of the wiki page and link to him at Gostick's page, in case he didn't know it existed.  Be aware that Wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons, edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later.  One was a recent high-level member of the Kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it.  Living or dead, I don't care to see this happen to anyone. 

Feel free to post at my page in answer if you wish.  Do you have a wiki email or a private one? """,0

The couple were in a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch together. Saturday Night Live/YouTube

Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have sparked some speculation that they got secretly married after stepping out with rings on their fingers in late October, and the engaged couple continued to fan the flames on ""Saturday Night Live.""

Cyrus, 24, performed two songs as the musical guest on Saturday's episode of the NBC sketch show. Her ring finger was especially noticeable during ""I Would Die For You,"" her second performance of the night.

Miley is still sporting two rings. Saturday Night Live/NBC

Hemsworth, 27, surprised fans with a cameo in a ""The Price Is Right"" sketch earlier in the night, but his left hand was covered throughout the whole thing. But at the end of the evening, as everyone clapped and said good night, a band could be spotted on his ring finger.

Some eagle-eyed fans spotted the rings on their fingers.

Now, this isn't the first time both have stepped out with bling on their ring fingers.

Back in August 2017, Hemsworth was spotted with the gold band on his finger, but sources told E! News that the ring was worn as a ""'promise' to Miley."" As for Cyrus' rings, she began wearing her engagement ring that Hemsworth first proposed with in 2012 after the two reconciled in 2016. She was spotted with a second ring on the finger in October, according to Glamour.

But Cyrus has spoken about her views on marriage, and doesn't seem too keen on tying the knot just yet.

In a recent interview with The Sun on Sunday, according to a report from The Daily Mail, Cyrus said she wants to wait a bit before getting married.

""I don't envision marriage. I'm 24. I hope I get to live a little bit more,"" she said. ""I have too much living to do [before I get married]. I have no idea what the next three years will bring, but if it's possible to get even happier, I'll take it.""

2691,"Selena Gomez And Jennifer Aniston Double Date: Jen's Comments About Weeknd Were Lies

Selena Gomez is currently dating The Weeknd. Her bestfriend Jennifer Aniston is supportive of her but their relationship is sometimes targeted by rumor mongers.


Selena Gomez and Jennifer Aniston were reported to have planned for a double date with their respective partners after The Weeknd's tour wraps up. The ""Hands to Myself"" singer was also reported telling that her BFF has given her advices on her new relationship. But fans of Justin Bieber's ex-girlfriend should not rejoice over the reports because they were declared as all lies.

According to Gossip Cop, the above-mentioned reports were found out to be all false and the source of the news was merely fabricating stories. The site which is out to expose hearsays and false reports about celebrities has verified the said reports.

The news that was published by Hollywood Life dated March 23 states that the ""Mother's Day"" star was excited for her little sister's new beau and she was grateful that she has found peace in life. She was reportedly proud of her and of what she has become. They were already talking about the planned double date as alleged by the report. Gomez was reportedly spending time with her boyfriend's family.

In another report from the same source dated January 17, 2017, it states that the ""Horrible Bosses"" actor has told the ""Kill Em With Kindness"" singer to follow her heart and that the Justin Theroux's wife was giving love advices to Selena Gomez.

Well, with the reports on Aniston's reactions about her friend's love life being debunked, the only reliable source would be people close to Gomez and since they have not publicized anything, it is best to take everything with a grain of salt. Regarding the double date, the probability that it will happen is nil at the moment but who knows, it might happen in the future.

The Weeknd and the 24-year-old former Disney star's relationship became controversial after it was revealed months back. The rapper has just moved on from a relationship with Bella Hadid and the model even warned her ex-boyfriend about Gomez. She said that the ""Same Old Love"" singer was only using him for her career.

Selena Gomez declared that she is determined to make their relationship work and denied all the negative comments about her. The singer, who has successfully dealt with her emotional issues due to her Lupus, is now happy supporting her boyfriend. She was seen at the rapper's concert in Brazil recently.

According to Life & Style, the shows were neck and neck with numbers during Megyn's first day in late September. At that time, Megyn very closely beat Kelly and Ryan by 172,000 viewers (2.932 million vs. 2.760 million). The best part for Megyn? She outnumbered them in the prime age demo: 25 to 54.

However, after a few bad interviews (who could ever forget the Jane Fonda and Will & Grace cast mishap), Megyn's ratings have gone down by 14 percent, which means Kelly and Ryan have taken the lead back. And the Today execs are totally not happy about it. ""Megyn just doesn't come across to the viewers as authentic,"" a network inside told Life & Style.

Things have been difficult for Megyn since her NBC debut. At this point, she's even having trouble getting A-listers to appear on her show. ""Megyn hasn’t been able to book any big-name stars that haven’t been on Today during the first two hours,"" a source told In Touch. ""Hollywood hasn't exactly put the welcome mat out for her. Megyn has left a lot of people cold.""

2645,"Halle Berry sparks pregnancy rumours after displaying baby bump on red carpet

Halle Berry, 50, has sparked rumours she is expecting her third child after debuting what looks like a ‘baby bump’ on the red carpet at the 16th Annual Chrysalis Butterfly Ball in Los Angeles.

The Oscar-winning actress looked stunning in a clinging silver sequinned dress and matching heels and posed for cameras with her hands on her tummy as though protectively cradling her ‘bump’.

Halle has yet to announce she is pregnant but when she turned to the side the bump was prominent in her dress and Halle seemed happy to show it off.

The star is not known to be dating anyone and last week posed on Instagram in a top that read ‘No more boyfriends’.

She captioned the photo: ‘Summer’s coming… let’s shine up our crowns ladies!’

Last night social media went into meltdown with speculation of who the baby daddy may be.

The Oscar-winner has two children already, having given birth to her second at the age of 47.

Halle had previously thought she was perimenopausal when she discovered she was pregnant with son Maceo to her French actor husband Olivier Martinez, who she divorced in December 2016.

The bump was even more prominent when Halle posed to the side [Picture: Splash] She has a nine-year-old daughter Nahla to Gabriel Aubry from a previous relationship.

Back in 2014, Halle said she was shocked to find out she was pregnant at 47.

‘They call it a geriatric pregnancy,’ she said at the time.

‘I was, you know, on my way … this is probably way TMI, but I was really, you know, kinda premenopausal so to have this happen was a huge [shock].’

‘I mean, I didn’t think it was possible to have another baby … So, I’ve learned never to say never.’

If she is she will be in good company as Janet Jackson recently gave birth at 50.

Or maybe Halle is playing us all along and it’s just a food baby in there…

Revealed the source: ""Michael won't give up on this marriage easily. Remember, this is a guy who battled back from deadly stage 4 tongue cancer!

The couple had a ""big blow-up"" before Michael headed off to work on  new film ""Ant Man"", said the insider, adding: ""He is preparing himself for the possibility of a $300 million divorce in 2015 if they can't work out their differences.""

There’s more to Kim Kardashian West’s newest fragrance, KKW Crystal Gardenia, than meets the eye!

The 37-year-old reality star and businesswoman is launching her new scent on Wednesday, and this time it’s personal.

“After my whole Paris situation over a year ago, all my friends would come over and bring me healing crystals,” Kim told ET’s Keltie Knight in an exclusive interview. “I wasn't really into them. I didn't know much about them. Enough people brought them over that I love the shape, I loved holding it, and I felt like, ‘OK, this is it. I want something that I feel like calms me, is healing...’ And I wanted the bottle, especially the smaller one.”

The mother of two wanted the crystal-shaped bottles to bring her fans a similar calm.

“It felt so pure to me,"" she noted. ""I just loved [how] the properties of the rose quartz and citrine bring happiness, and it just meant so much to me to look into what crystals mean and their healing properties.”

Career:
1. Trapper (sub heading under career)
His earlier mindset surrounding trapping will be discussed in greater depth, as not much is discussed with regards to how he viewed trapping before his switch to conservationism.
His work with the Ojibwa Indians / Guppy Family will be explored as they were critical in his development as a trapper that understood the fragility of the animal ecosystem (Smith, 41)
The time of his life spent working and living at the Temagami Inn as a chore-boy will be mentioned as this was one of the events in which  Archie first became an observer of the Objibwa way of life. (Smith, 40)
His love interest, Angele will also be discussed as she also introduced Archie to influential figures within the Objibwa community, providing Archie with plenty of sketches for his infamous notebooks. (Smith, 42)

His initial desires to write will also be explored, this section then ending with the completion of his first book “The Men of the Last Frontier” which can be seen as one of the starting points of his public conservation career.

His outlook on conservationism will be explored, using both Tina Loo’s “States of Nature” Conserving Canada’s Wildlife in the Twentieth Century, and Donald Smith’s “From the Land of Shadows,” and Grey Owl’s “Pilgrims of the Wild” as sources which deal with his mindset of conservationism in detail.

4. Conservation Legacy (sub heading under Posthumous recognition)
The inspiration his lectures, books and films had on the people who came into contact with them will be explored deeper by using the sources below, as this is an area of his life which is largely overshadowed by the controversy of his false indigenous identity.

5. Death
His relationships with Parks Board Canada prior to his death will be explored, delving into such aspects as how his increased use of alcohol, and absence from the park due to his touring  prior to his death impacted his relationship with Parks Board.

no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that """"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"""".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says """"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"""" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.

If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said """"What language is that?"""" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.

Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.

I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to """"Winston Churchill"""".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.

Anyone have any thoughts on the addition of Bernard Lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians?  Since Augustine, Aquinas are listed and Lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of Catholic philosophers, I thought he would be a good addition to the list. His work is well-regarded in 20th century philosophy, he certainly has the credentials, and I think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory, epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the """"data of consciousness"""" and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science. see Insight: A study of Human Understanding. There are Lonergan Centers at Boston College, University of Toronto, Seton Hall, and Loyola Marymount University devoted to studying and extending his works in philosophy and theology.

It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

While discussing the British exit from the European Union, Pitt opened up to the New York Times' T magazine about his feelings toward Trump.

""Man, I never thought [Brexit] would happen. Same way I can't bring myself to think that Trump will be in charge,"" he admitted. ""In the simplest terms, what brings us together is good, and what separates us is bad.""

He continued, ""We have this great line in The Big Short,"" referring to last year's Oscar-winning film about the global financial crisis of 2008, which he produced. ""When things are going wrong and we can't find the reason for it, we just start creating enemies.""

James Corden just asked Kim Kardashian about the Khloe and Kylie pregnancy rumours
2017-11-16 08:52:00
Two months after rumours broke out that both Kylie Jenner and sister Khloé Kardashian might be pregnant at the same time, we still don't know any more than we did in September. Big sis Kim Kardashian won't be ending the suspense any time soon, judging by her recent appearance on James Corden.

Kim took part in a particularly nasty game of ""Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts,"" a staple of the Corden show where James and a guest ask each other questions that could get them in trouble. If one of the players refuses to answer, they have to eat a gut-churning ~delicacy~.

When asked to rank her mum and sisters from best to worst dressed, Kim didn't hesitate to oblige — understandable, since the alternative was to drink bird saliva (eek!). But when the million-dollar question — the question of Kylie and Khloé's pregnancy rumours, obvs — inevitably came up, Kim chose to drink a sardine smoothie instead. This is one of those moments we're glad we're not famous.

Kiki has shut down rumours about her reaction to Kylie's pregnancy, but hasn't given us any clues as to whether the rumours are actually true or not. Guess we'll just have to keep being patient.

As for James, he refused to reveal which of his guests was the most obnoxious (he ate a scorpion instead!), but did say that Kylie was his least favourite Kardashian. The youngest sister was supposed to appear on Corden's show, but apparently backed out.

Tana, 41, wife of chef Gordon, is expecting her fifth as is Jools Oliver, 41, wife of chef Jamie. David has been keen on a fifth since daughter Harper was born in 2011.

Meanwhile, I can reveal that three years after retiring, David Beckham has ventured back on to the football pitch – as a referee.

The former England captain has twice been called up to referee after-school matches for his 11-year-old son Cruz's team in West London.

On the first occasion, when the original referee failed to turn up, the coach asked an American parent to do the honours, but he responded: 'Are you kidding me, I'm standing right next to David Beckham!'

2629,"Gave up weed for pregnancy? Miley Cyrus, Liam Hemsworth reportedly trying for twins

Singer Miley Cyrus and actor Liam Hemsworth are reportedly trying for twins. The couple reconciled in early 2016.

The Last Song co-stars are believed to be “super excited” for Cyrus to be pregnant, reports OK Magazine.

“Miley and Liam just love that family dynamic and Miley is desperate to give Liam a child and figures why not go for twins,” said a source.

“The couple has looked into IVF to increase their chances, and they’re both super excited. A boy and a girl would make Miley’s happiness complete,” the source added.

Cyrus has also given up alcohol, weed and other drugs in order to have a healthy pregnancy.

The Wrecking Ball hitmaker also released a new single Malibu, which is dedicated to Hemsworth.

2658,"This Is What Brad Pitt Has Been Texting Jennifer Aniston

It has been six months since Brangelina (that's Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for anyone who has been living under a rock for the last twelve years) announced their split. The couple famously met on set of Mr & Mrs Smith in 2004 while Brad was already married to Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and they sparked a media frenzy when Brad left Jen and pursued a relationship with Ange a short while later.

It might sound like an EastEnders-worthy love triangle, but it was all very real for Jen, and Brangelina happened for a good thirteen years before it suddenly broke down at the end of last year.

But anyone gunning for a friendly reunion between Brad and Jen (is Bren a thing?) after all these years may finally get their wish, as it has been reported that the two are 'texting' amidst Brad's divorce from Angelina.

According to US Weekly, Brad reached out to Jen to wish her a happy 48th birthday in February and the former couple started making baby steps to rebuilding their broken relationship.

A source told the publication: 'They started talking once he wished her a happy birthday.

'Brad's told her he's having a hard time with his split and they exchanged a few texts reminiscing about the past.'

However, anyone hoping that Bren is going to happen again will be sorely disappointed. Jennifer has been married to Justin Theroux since 2015 and the source confirms that Justin is more than happy for his wife to be in contact with her ex.

'Justin is okay with them being friends [as he knows] Jen just wanted to be nice,' the source said.

We're so glad that these two are finally in a place where they can be friends again (ahem, pun intended).

It’s hard to get much more sensational than this: a TV show pairing the world’s most famous transgender celebrity with the world’s most famous acquitted murder suspect — especially when both have connections to the Kardashians! Life & Style has exclusively learned that TV producers have come up with an idea to bring O.J. Simpson and his old pal Caitlyn Jenner together in a televised reunion.

The former football star, 70, who was acquitted of double homicide in 1995 and completed a nine-year prison stint on Oct. 1 for a 2007 armed robbery and kidnapping, has known Caitlyn, 68, since she was Olympic gold medalist Bruce. They also share the Kardashian connection: Long before Caitlyn married into the family, O.J. was best buds with Kris’ first husband, Robert. O.J. should be interested in the show, a source says, but there’s a snag: Caitlyn has “wanted nothing to do with O.J.” since the NFL star was charged with murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.

Though they haven’t approached her yet, producers are hoping to convince Caitlyn to sign on by pitching it as “an informative, interview-type show,” the source says, in which she introduces O.J. to the new Caitlyn and asks him probing questions about his ups and downs. “If they do it right,” says the source, “it would be fascinating.”

And while the public, might be hesitant to watch such a reunion, the producers are convinced plenty of people will tune in to view the show. “Love them or hate them,” says a source, “putting Caitlyn and O.J. in the same room would be must-see TV.”

 Section needs to be edited 

This line about New Hampshire is not very accurate:

On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Day was officially observed in all 50 states.[4] Prior to that New Hampshire and Arizona did not observe the day.

In fact, New Hampshire passed """"Civil Rights Day"""" in 1991, to honor Dr King, and other civil rights activists like Rosa Parks and Malcolm X.  Since the article states clearly that other states, such as Utah, have different names for the holiday, including combining it with Confederate military heroes, this sentence does not seem justifiable.  The article leaves the impression that New Hampshire was some sort of bigoted state, that was one of the last to recognize this holiday.

Requests for comment
I've echoed the suggestions of Mackensen and others that you take this to Wikipedia:Requests for comment.  Your most recent reply on Mackensen's talk page is:

 I could, but I think Arbcom should accept the case with or without an RfC. There's too much misconduct to willfully ignore. Besides, you're only asking me to do that to delay the inevitable, why would I ever take that advice?

There are several problems with this response:
 Firstly a number of other editors have asked you to go through RfC: , the  closer or the first Articles for deletion discussion, , who as far as I can tell played no part in earlier discussions,  who also seems to have been absent from earlier discussions, and , an arbitrator who in rejecting the case said """"If you can't be bothered with an RfC then we can't be bothered with an arbitration case.""""  has also remarked on your failure to follow process here.
 Again you allege misconduct, on a scale too great """"to wilfully ignore"""".  If there appears to be such a level of misconduct and yet the arbitrators can't see it, it looks like you'll have to make it more apparent to them.

But finally, despite all the others including arbitrators who have asked you to go to RfC, you say that I in particular am only asking you to go to RfC """"to delay the inevitable"""".  Well I'm not sure that you and I can agree on what """"the inevitable"""" is in this case.  To my eyes this looks a case on which you really wouldn't like to hear what the arbitrators have to say, and they've hinted on this in their comments on the case.  But since they're obviously not going to accept the case until you've at least made an honest attempt to conduct some intermediate steps in dispute resolution, I'm urging you to do so.  If an arbitration case follows, the sooner the better as far as I'm concerned, so get cracking. Tony Sidaway """,0

2656,"Is Ryan Seacrest Quitting 'Live'?

Ryan Seacrest is reportedly having a hard time adjusting to life in New York City. The talk show and radio host is renting a place in Manhattan so that he can be in the Big Apple during the week in order to host Live! with Kelly Ripa each morning. However, a new report from Radar Online claims that Seacrest — who had previously been living in Los Angeles — is “miserable” on the East Coast.

“Ryan is miserable. [Moving was] the biggest mistake of his life. He hasn’t embraced the city and hasn’t been going out to the restaurants or parties. He’s invited to almost every event every night and doesn’t go! He’s such an LA guy and is finding NYC tough. The weather and the hustle of the city is too much. He can’t wait until the weekends to fly back to his beloved LA,” a source told the popular gossip site.

Although Radar Online doesn’t name a source and has been known to fabricate stories from time to time, this one has some people convinced. It seems more than obvious that Seacrest loved living in Los Angeles and he travels to the West Coast so frequently that one could assume he’s unhappy in New York. He has been rooted in California for years and is used to a different way of life. Moving across the country would be a huge change for anyone, let alone someone famous who has loved that LA lifestyle for so long.

This new report coincides with constant rumors that Seacrest and his Live! co-host, Kelly Ripa, aren’t getting along. Although the two have been pals for many years, sources have said that they are at each other’s throats and that their on-air chemistry (which some fans wouldn’t argue doesn’t even exist) ends the moment the cameras stop rolling.

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, ratings on Live! have dipped since the announcement that Seacrest was the new co-host. However, that dip was almost to be expected, given the hype built up around the announcement, which had been building for a whole year. However, sources have said that Seacrest wasn’t Ripa’s first choice — and maybe not even her second choice. For fans of Live!, Seacrest wasn’t even in their top five (favorite contenders included Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper, Fred Savage, Jerry O’Connell, and even Kelly’s husband, Mark Consuelos).

So, if any of these rumors are true, will Seacrest end up leaving Live!? It is definitely a possibility. However, the gig hasn’t seemed right for Seacrest since his name was announced on Monday, May 1. Some fans feel that he wasn’t the best choice to be Ripa’s co-host — and maybe that’s going to turn out to be true.

There are plenty of rumors out there suggesting that Seacrest is going to leave Live! in 2018. It is entirely possible that he will want to move back to Los Angeles — and that he may ink a deal to host the new American Idol. That gig has been a part of him for so many years that it almost seems impossible for the show to be successful without him.

Details of Seacrest’s contract with Live! are unknown. He may have signed a one-year deal or he may have signed a multi-year deal. However, there are always ways for someone to get around something if they aren’t happy or it’s not working.

Do you think Seacrest and Ripa are good together? Do you think Seacrest would prefer to move back to Los Angeles and leave morning talk in the past? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

None: Beefart replies

Thanks for you comments. Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally """"no one"""". In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to """"no one"""". It is impossible to say """"no one are dinosaurs"""". It has to be """"no one is a dinosaur"""". Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding """"none"""" to """"no one"""" does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...). Here the best we can hope for is to propose that """"none"""" is a synonym for """"nothing"""".

2794,"Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes Hit New York Fashion Week

Jamie Foxxand Katie Holmes have hit the Big Apple. 

This unconfirmed pair has a knack for popping up in the same city around the same time and it happened again when the two actors were spotted separately throughout Manhattan this week as the bi-annual fashion week comes to another close.

While the Logan Lucky actress headed to fashion shows for Lanyu and Ralph Lauren earlier in the week, the musician attended other events around town, including the Sherri Hill fashion show, in which his daughter walked on Tuesday night, and the Hand in Hand celebrity benefit for hurricane relief.  

While the Manhattan shutterflies haven't caught the two together, it's only been a week since a source confirmed the two stars spent Labor Day in Malibu together, ""holding hands"" along the sand. 

""They went in the water and were splashing around, flirting and getting close,"" the source added, describing the outing as a ""romantic date."" TMZ also published photos of their holiday rendezvous. Meanwhile, the two have yet to confirm their longtime speculated romantic link. ""They are really happy,"" an insider previously told E! News. ""It's easy and they are for sure very much in love.""

Rochlin/Hand in Hand/Getty Images; Clint Spaulding/WWD/REX/Shutterstock
Though we can only purely speculate that the two may have crossed paths while in New York, Foxx was focused on another special lady—his daughter, Corinne Bishop. The actor was a proud dad Tuesday night as Bishop strutted the catwalk in elegant evening couture at Sherri Hill.  

""He's like my number one fan,"" she told E! News of her father backstage at the show. Once she hit the runway, the star could be seen sitting front row with his phone glued on his daughter, capturing her every step. 

As he told reporters backstage, ""For any father with young kids, we hope that they find something that they want to do and they find something that makes them feel good about it.""

 Randroide Answers to """"Next Step"""" 

Guys, I do not see you taking steps to Wikipedia:Requests for mediation.

I can not do this job because I always connect from """"filtered"""" institutional net-access, and following those steps could result in new, undesired, controversial """"truncation"""" of words by the software. I do not want that happenning.

Could you please follow the instructions in the link I provided?. Thank you. 

 Randroide answers to New reference by Burgas00 

  At last we agree on something!...of course that the new section is a good idea: The false """"suicidal"""" terrorists from PRISA will also be included there. 

Come oooooon, boys, start writing that section. I do not want all the kudos for myself: The new proposed article is, by now, an effort made only by me. 

But remember: NPOV and sources, all the sources. Just like me citing """"El País"""" in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb. Cheers  

 

Indeed, a good point. And all the remarks in COPE too. And the """"moral certitudes"""" of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo.

  I agree with you 100%, Larean.

  What Randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so, the original version he created was entirely POV, as is much of the rest of the proposed article. Also, all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers - NPOV it is not. 

  You are right, Southofwatford, in your """"Randroide omits..."""" section.

If you have not subscription to """"El País"""", I am sorry but that´s your problem. My """"institutional"""" access also has some advantages, like paid access to """"El País"""" (and many, many other publications and books). That´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of """"filtered"""" Internet accesss: It´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.

Do you see?. The truncation of words is offsett (I think) by better sources.

BTW, if you write under a """"Randroide answers"""" section you are:
Invading """"my"""" space. I do not mind, really. But you are doing it.
Risking new truncations on your messages. To avoid this, please write OUTSIDE """"Randroide answers"""" sections.

If you think that the proposed article is POV, work in it to make it NPOV. The article is not """"mine"""".

  I'll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here, it's very short.

Very funny, Southofwatford. 

I am going to follow this joke of yours.

Please propose also the deletion of all books as sources, because, did you know?, there is always someone without this or that book.
Delete all references to TV or radio stations, because that user in Brazil has no TV and no radio at home.
Delete all the references in spanish, because, did you know?, there are users who know no spanish.

It´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes, really. I had a good laugh.

User:Southofwatford  How strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it's simply bizarre. Equally, in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response.

2735,"EXCLUSIVE: WHERE WILLIAM, KATE, AND GEORGE ARE HEADED FOR A MONTH-LONG SUMMER VACATION

They have spent the last two days supporting Great Britain at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, but __William__and __Kate__can look forward to a well-deserved month off in August.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have cleared their diaries and will be holidaying in the U.K., Royal Watch can reveal. William and Kate usually jet off to the private island of Mustique, but they are planning to stay a little closer to home this summer. Sources say they will be taking __Prince George__to Scotland next month to __Charles__and Camilla, at their Highland home, and they will also take Prince George to see the __Queen__and __Prince Philip__at Balmoral.

According to my sources, the couple will spend the rest of the time off in Norfolk, where the final refurbishments are being completed at their new country home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen's Sandringham Estate.

Kate has been hands-on with the renovations and has helped with the redesign and interiors, and is apparently keen to make sure the final touches go exactly as planned.

""They will be at Anmer for much of the time they have off,"" a source revealed to Royal Watch. ""They cannot wait to move in and they want to make sure the last stages of the refurb go to plan.

The 10-bedroom house has its own tennis court and swimming pool-perfect for little Prince George, who has recently been enjoying swimming lessons at the pool at Buckingham Palace.

The Duchess revealed while at the games that Prince George loves splashing about in the water.

The Cambridges are heading to Belgium with __Prince__Harry for World War I commemorations next Monday, but after that their holiday begins and they can relax until September.

The “Famous” rapper rocked a beige sweater, camouflage cargo pants, and his new, unreleased Yeezy sneakers while leaving a business meeting on Wednesday (June 7) in Calabasas, Calif.

This past week, Kanye and his wife Kim Kardashian dropped nearly half a million dollars (via E! News) and headed to the Bahamas with their family for some early birthday celebrations.

The two “had a great time on vacation in Baker’s Bay [on the island of Great Guana Cay in the Bahamas],” Entertainment Tonight reports. “They spent six days at a private home and were able to go totally off the map. No work or social media, it’s just what their family needed. Kanye brought his friend, Don Crowley, along with his family. The children had a great time. They hung around at the pool most of the day.”

They reportedly stayed at the home of Mike Meldman, who owns Casamigos Tequila along with with Rande Gerber and George Clooney.

“Cheers!” Kim captioned an Instagram video of herself living it up in a black bikini (below).

Two weeks ago, Kanye and Kim rang in three years of marriage with a romantic meal.

2592,"Keith Urban Jealous: Nicole Kidman Admits She Begged HBO To Cast Alexander Skarsgard As Her Love Interest | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Nicole Kidman is making it pretty clear that she desperately wanted Alexander Skarsgard to be cast as her husband in ‘Big Little Lies.’ Nicole is starring in the new HBO drama series along with Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley and Laura Dern. The show tells the story of three mothers who try to move on after a tragedy that almost destroyed their lives.

The Hollywood actress even said that she almost begged producers to cast Alexander, who is often regarded as one of the hottest stars in the celebrity world. In fact, Nicole even told Vulture in a new interview, “Yeah, he was so good. I wanted him badly! I was like come on, please. Come on, HBO, we’ve gotta get him. And, obviously, he’s very tall as well, which is really, really helpful for me. It’s not often that I look small. So physically he’s very dominating as well, which is frightening, but I take him on.”

With that being said, a lot of Nicole’s fans can’t help but wonder if she might be throwing a little shade towards her husband Keith Urban’s direction. After all, Nicole often towers him whenever they are on the red carpet together.

Plus, Nicole has even admitted that Keith doesn’t feel comfortable watching her love scenes with Alexander on ‘Big Little Lies.’ She said that even though Keith understands that her intimate sex scenes are part of her job, the country singer still watches them with only one eye open.

Of course, it’s not surprising that Nicole Kidman would want to work with someone like Alexander Skarsgard. He’s a Hollywood sex symbol. Plus, the characters on ‘Big Little Lies’ often comment on how beautiful Nicole and Alexander’s characters are on the show. Together, they are a perfect couple on the outside, but with plenty of deep dark secrets that no one knows about in the inside.

Knowing how much sex appeal he has, it’s no wonder that Nicole wanted to be paired with him on the small screen. No one else can play a troubled, yet sexy husband, father, and businessman the way Alexander does.

Tell us, are you surprised that Nicole Kidman wanted Alexander Skarsgard in ‘Big Little Lies?’ What do you think of Nicole’s role on the show?

The titles need not show that the characters are related, all about this is in the articles. You see, the nature of fiction is that it's not necessarily coherent. Since this article is not about Malcolm Wilkerson in the first episode of the show """"Malcolm in the Middle"""" but about the character throughout the show, it is indeed inaccurate to use a name for the character that was only used for the pilot episode. For the entire rest of the seven season run, the character's name was only """"Malcolm"""". This is not a question of beauty or taste, but of plain accuracy. A title like """"Malcolm (XXX)"""" my appear clumsy, but Wilkerson is not an alternative. In my opinion. If can't build consensus on this between the two of us, I suggest asking for additional input at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions, since I didn't find anything in the guidelines for a specific case like this (although I'm fairly sure the fact that the character's name was """"Wilkerson"""" only during the first of 151 episodes of the show means that calling the character """"Wilkerson"""", esp. in the title, is inaccurate). —'''''' """,0

2702,"Fans think Taylor Swift and Drake might be dating - here's all the evidence

Fans think Taylor Swift and Drake are dating. 

They're probably just making music together. 

The truth can be a slippery thing.



 Let's get this out of the way right now: Taylor Swift and Drake are probably not dating. But according to some people, they are - and if true, it could be huge news in the music business.

Though there's little evidence to support the theory that Drake and Taylor are an item, people online have been conjecturing wildly. Here's what we know.

At the stroke of midnight, on the evening of October 23, Drake turned 30 years old. He hosted a big birthday party and, as celebrities do, had a bunch of other celebrities and hanger-ons there.

""Taylor arrived with some friends and looked to be having fun,"" an anonymous source told E!. ""After dinner there was lots of dancing. At one point Drake and Taylor were seen near the DJ together talking, his arm over her shoulder for a minute like a real friend moment. It looked like they were talking about something deep.""

At some point during the evening, ""everyone sang happy birthday to Drake,"" according to E!. Swift was presumably among the singers.

Drake also introduced Swift to his mom, according to TMZ. Swift and Drake posed for a few photos, and that's the extent of their known contact that night.

So, are they dating? Twitter users sure shipped them.

""Rihanna how do you feel about Drake and Taylor Swift dating?""

Can't wait for Drake and Taylor Swift to break up and write albums dragging each other - Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) October 28, 2016

On November 2, as the dating rumors were flaring up, Page Six came out with another report that the two were making music together. E! News confirmed the report:

For those surprised by the seemingly unlikely duo, our source reveals ""the music they have been working on is different,"" albeit ""very catchy."" The insider adds, ""They've both been having a great time in the studio.""

That means they're spending a lot of time together. Possibly alone. Possibly not. So they could be working on music together, and they could be hooking up. Who's to say?

Drake has an impish, winking relationship with his fans. On ""Saturday Night Live,"" he once sang about how he's more than just a meme. So later in November, he posted a picture of himself and Swift together with the caption ""Is that velvet? ""

A photo posted by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Nov 4, 2016 at 1:34am PDT on

Once again, a general freak out occurred. The coy flower emoji seemed especially designed to make people wonder what on earth was happening.

The hip-hop artist released an ad where - in his self-aware persona - he sings along to Swift's ""Bad Blood.""

It's a reference to a commercial Swift made a few months earlier, where she ran on a treadmill, and fell off it, while singing along to Drake and Future's ""Jumpman.""

And when Drake posted his ad on Instagram, he snuck in the hashtag ""#Draylor."" Maybe it's a hashtag for the ad, maybe it's a hashtag for the two as a couple. Clearly, Swift and Drake are friendly enough to make referential meta-jokes about one another.

The Swift-Drake relationship is less about actual evidence that they're dating and more about wish fulfillment and fun speculation. Fans don't believe the couple are dating as much as they want to will their relationship into existence.

But why does it hold so much appeal?

For her part, Swift recently ended a summer fling with Tom Hiddleston. That relationship was a strange fit. Swift is one of the biggest celebrities in the world. Hiddleston - though he is a fine actor, conventionally attractive, and still the best villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - is simply not on her level.

Apart from star power, Hiddleston, 35, always seemed so much older than Swift, 26. For these reasons and more, Hiddleswift always made for a slightly bizarre coupling to outsiders.

Meanwhile, Drake has been in an on-again-off-again relationship with Rihanna for years. It arguably culminated in August when Drake professed his love for her on stage in the VMAs. But right now, they're off again.

A Swift-Drake relationship would distract the public from any image-altering breakups and reestablish both of them as the desirable, über talented A-listers they are.

Of course, this narrative could just be publicity for their new song together. Even if Swift and Drake aren't in love, they're a match made in PR heaven.

Betty White is planning to quit TV acting at 95 to check items off her bucket list!

RadarOnline.com can reveal the surprising things the TV legend, who won Emmys playing Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Rose Nylund on The Golden Girls, still plans to accomplish before hitting 100 — including Broadway theater, wild adventures and even romance!

After the cancellation of her TV series Hot in Cleveland in 2014, White’s telling pals she’s closing up shop.

“She feels she can live to 100 and has other things she wants to do with her life,” a friend says.

Topping her list is travel. Instead of visiting cushy resorts, she’s planning on a real adventure.

“Betty says she wants to go on an African safari,” reveals her pal.

“She also wants to spend more time with her friends before they all pass on.”

And she hasn’t totally given up on acting. Her true dream ­is to star on Broadway.

“That’s definitely on Betty’s bucket list,” the friend says. “She hasn’t done much live, on-stage work and she thinks it would be a perfect cap to her long career to appear on Broadway.”

The friend says Betty takes pen to paper nearly every day to finish a new memoir, and she’s also working on a script for a romantic comedy!

Since she has no children, she plans to leave her $45 million fortune to animal welfare groups founded by her husband, Allen Ludden, a game show host who died in 1981.

While she could still find work on TV, the source says Broadway is the only reason she’d return to acting.

“But if her acting career is over, she’s at peace with it. She wants to enjoy her time, without everyone fussing over her!” adds the pal.

2591,"Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake on the brink of divorce

The American magazine OK! announced the five-year-marriage has come to an end

Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel have decided to go separate ways.

According to the American paper, this could be one of the most expensive divorces from the industry, considering the pair possesses a $300 million fortune.

Apparently, their marriage started to crumble because the conflicts related to their child, careers and Justin’s “other woman” multiplied.

Last month, Jessica attended the Emmy’s Awards Gala alone, looking sad and weak.

According to sources inside their entourage, the situation is the same for months now.

The Emmy Gala was a pretty big deal for Jessica and they usually support each other when it comes to such things.

The fact that Justin refused to be with her proves their relation has deteriorated.

It seems that Justin was on the night of the gala in Brazil, where he performed in a concert, but Biel was obviously bothered by his reaction because he didn’t make any effort.

“Jess feels many times as if she is a single mother and became tired of this. She does not trust him anymore”, revealed a source for OK!, stating that Biel and Justin are also fighting because he is cheating on her.

American singer and actor Justin Timberlake married actress Jessica Biel on October 19, 2012 in southern Italy, after a five-year relationship that began in 2007.

The two artists got engaged on Christmas 2011 and they have a son, Silas Randall Timberlake, who is now two years old.

2822,"Kendall Jenner FINALLY Talks About Those Scott Disick Relationship Rumors

Kendall Jenner and the rest of her famous family are (unfortunately) pretty used to hearing rumors about themselves and their loved ones. Over the years, they've accumulated quite a bit of press coverage — some of it factually untrue — which Ryan Seacrest brought up in a deleted scene from this past Sunday's KUWTK 10 year special via E! .

""A lot of people read the tabloids, some rely on the tabloids to get pretty inaccurate information. Some of those headlines, pretty darn ridiculous,"" Ryan said, per E! . He then went on to tell the family that they would be shown some of the most outrageous stories that have been published, and would be given the opportunity to respond and say whether or not they were true.

They then brought up a headline about Kendall Jenner and Scott Disick that read: ""Kendall: How Scott Seduced Me!"" It referenced the ongoing rumor that Kendall and her older sister Kourtney 's former partner (and the father of her three children) were in a relationship. Kendall responded: ""I didn't even know that existed. I was 19. That was two years ago. Definitely false though.""

Though we imagined as much, the segment went on to address some other rumors, such as that Kris Jenner had a relationship with Lamar Odom, Khloé 's ex-husband, and Khloé responded by joking that it was actually her who was with Scott the whole time.

Needless to say, all of the rumors that were brought up were unfounded, but it's refreshing to see them maintain their sense of humor about it all. After 10 years of dealing with this sort of stuff, we imagine they are becoming old pros. Watch the video for yourself below:
