2606,"Retiring Soon? Kanye West Is Stepping Away From Spotlight

The 'Famous' hitmaker is reportedly planning to step away from the spotlight for an indefinite amount of time.
Kanye West sparks retirement speculations after he recently deleted his social media accounts. Rumor has it, the ""Famous"" hitmaker is planning to step away from the spotlight for an indefinite amount of time. 

""Kanye never found the happiness he was looking for by being famous. In fact, if anything, the spotlight made him unhappier. He has decided to take a break and step away for a while,"" sources reveal. 

""Not going to the Met ball was a big deal for him,"" the sources tell Naughty Gossip, ""He loves that event and thinks of himself as a serous designer. He has just had enough and doesn't care if he is never photographed again."" 

Kanye recently resurfaced in Malibu after reportedly making a trip to Wyoming mountaintop to record his new album. He tried to avoid public events as much as possible after he experienced a breakdown during his concert last year.

2411,"Heartbroken Jennifer Aniston Runs For The Border To Adopt

Jennifer Aniston is looking to adopt a baby from south of the border - just weeks after The National ENQUIRER revealed her heartbreak over her estranged brother announcing that he was becoming a father yet again!

And the decision to head into Mexico for a baby was made easier by the years she's spent doing charity work for The Casa Hogar Sion Orphanage in Tijuana!

The ENQUIRER first discovered Jennifer helping out the kids of the Tijuana orphanage back in 2010. ""When you drive up to this place,"" said Jen, ""you see these kids come running out and you hear a chorus of, 'La, la, la, la!'""

But the former ""Friends"" star has endured a number of frustrating attempts to get pregnant with her own child.

Jen, 47, even froze a number of her eggs shortly before she turned 39 on Feb. 11, 2008.

Now her 2015 marriage to Justin Theroux has the newlywed celeb ready to look at the orphanage in a whole different light!

Carmen Gonzalez, who operates the orphanage, told the UK's ""Heat"" magazine: ""I am very happy. I wish that I could speak more about it, but, because of the rules we have to operate under, I can't.""

But other insiders are reporting that they're hoping that Jennifer will finally return from a trip to Tijuana with a baby of her own!

Meanwhile, A.J. is still anticipating the birth of his next child. Her sibling may not even know about Jennifer's plan to adopt. A.J. has no use for his famous sister's fame - adding: ""It's been a pain in my ass for years!""

2455,"Did Meek Mill Find Nicki Minaj In A Lesbian Tryst With Young M.A.?

Finding a story about Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill isn't exactly a stretch. Last year, Meek Mill's beef with Canadian rapper Drake kept us entertained for months, and Minaj is hardly low-profile. Over the past few years, Minaj has become known almost as well for her social media fights as for her music. As a result, celebrity watchers always seem to have an eye for the next Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj story. In recent weeks, most stories about Mill and Minaj have focused on whether or not hip-hop's power couple are still dating or not.

In recent days, rumors have emerged claiming that Meek Mill walked into Minaj's dressing room to find her and female rapper Young M.A. in a lesbian tryst. Ace Showbiz has speculated that Meek Mill and Minaj split last month after Meek lost his cool. Mill went on an Instagram rant at Minaj and then deleted his account. The same site reports that MediaTakeOut claims Minaj has become infatuated with female rapper Young M.A. and has split with Meek as a result.

All Hip-Hop claims that Minaj ""plays for both teams"" and says that she certainly has ""rapped some lines over the years that have suggested that she may be a little bi-sexual or certainly bi-curious.""

Of course, certain media outlets rarely let the truth get in the way of a good story, and it seems that the latest Mill-Minaj split rumors are just exactly that - rumors with no credible evidence to support them. Indeed, a glance at Minaj's Instagram account suggests that Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj are very much together, as they enjoyed Halloween together. Nicki shared a selection of images with her 67 million followers that showed her having fun with Mill.

Gossip Cop reports that the stories claiming Mill and Minaj have split are not only false, they accuse the original source of spreading false stories about the rappers.

""The webloid's perspective, though, continues to differ from reality. Minaj and Mill are very much still together, as she herself showed on Instagram Monday morning. ""And while the relationship might not last forever, Minaj is not ""dropping"" Mill for Young M.A. MediaTakeOut should probably start looking elsewhere than Twitter and Instagram for its made-up stories.""

Of course, some might question why Gossip Cop sees itself as the arbiter of truth when it comes to Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill. After all, they seem to rely on the images posted on Minaj's Instagram account as evidence that Meek and Minaj are still an item. One has to wonder if Gossip Cop sees the irony in this, given that they invite another outlet to look beyond Instagram for stories.

Many will wonder why Minaj and Mill do not take legal action against outlets spreading false stories. The truth may lay in Minaj's hunger for publicity. According to Hip-Hop DX, Minaj was recently quoted as saying that Meek Mill's high-profile beefs with the like of Drake are great publicity. Perhaps Minaj believes that all publicity is good publicity.

The reality is that the public has no right to know anything about Mill and Minaj that the couple doesn't want shared publicly. It is easy to claim that Minaj and Mill gave up their rights to privacy when they entered the entertainment industry. There is no doubt that artists like Minaj and Mill exploit the opportunities for publicity social media affords them. Some claim this makes them ""fair game"" for the gossip columns.

The reality is that Nicki Minaj's sexuality is her own affair, and she should not be judged or ""slut-shamed"" for it. The inner workings of Minaj's relationship with Meek Mill are no one's business but their own.

2815,"Leonardo DiCaprio Also Enjoyed Staring at ""Salvator Mundi,"" $100 Million da Vinci

One might not normally expect to find Leonardo DiCaprio , Patti Smith , Alex Rodriguez, and Jennifer Lopez at the same party (well, the last two, perhaps), but this weekend, all four were among the estimated 4,500 attendees of an auction preview at Christie’s. There, they had the chance to get eyes on “Salvator Mundi,” a Leonardo da Vinci painting previously thought lost that is being touted as “ The Last da Vinci ” leading up to its auction tonight.

“The Last da Vinci,” which dates to 1500 and is estimated to sell for around $100 million, is also the title of the new Christie’s video promoting the piece’s auction, an event that's getting the marketing treatment of a summer blockbuster movie. Supposedly shot from the perspective of Jesus (that is, from the perspective of the painting, which depicts Jesus as “Savior of the World”), it depicts various viewers gathered in front of the painting, many of them glassy-eyed with emotion. And, Where’s Waldo -like, a keen-eyed observer might also spot Smith and DiCaprio, fresh off his 43rd birthday, among the video’s subjects, albeit looking significantly less on the verge of tears than many of the other viewers.

After all, DiCaprio might just be there to get a few insights, Daniel Day-Lewis-style, into his next character: The Oscar-winner and climate justice enthusiast is slated to play Leonardo da Vinci in an upcoming biopic based on Leonardo da Vinci , the biography by Walter Isaacson. Paramount scooped up the rights to the film back in August, with DiCaprio slated to star in, and co-produce, the film, which will require him to grow his Revenant beard to unprecedented lengths.

Bringing things full circle, “The Last da Vinci” is scored by the Max Richter piece “On the Nature of Daylight,” a movie-soundtrack staple that was recently used in the opening scene of Arrival and, before that, in Shutter Island , which, yes, starred DiCaprio, and was directed by Martin Scorsese, from whom DiCaprio is now practically inseparable . It’s probably only a matter of time before Scorsese signs on to DiCaprio’s da Vinci biopic. After all, they’re also working on a Teddy Roosevelt biopic together. But Leo, while you're playing namesakes, where is that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reboot?

Margot Robbie, who co-starred with DiCaprio in 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' is here to show you what vegemite sounds like:

1853,"""

I was just released from prison on December 18, 2009.  During the period ending about November 4, 2009, I engaged in a 101-day hunger strike.  (Actually, 100 and 2/3 days:  Started 221 pounds, ended up an estimated 171 pounds).  Generally, I drank two cups of milk in the morning, and drank water as needed.  I was never force-fed.  Nor, oddly enough, was I ever hungry, or in appreciable discomfort.  I was examined, almost daily, by prison medical staff.  Probably the reason that I did so well was that I understood that the most important thing is to maintain the body's electrolytes (calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, phosphate), and to consume just enough amino-acids to supply neurotransmitters. (If you merely drink water, after a couple weeks you'll lose enough electrolytes to cause an imbalance, and you'll feel terrible.  Most people attribute this to not eating, but I learned that it's actually due to the electrolyte imbalance, NOT the lack of calories.)  At the time, the longest hunger strike I'd ever heard of was referred to in the Capote book, """"In Cold Blood"""", by Perry Smith, in the early 1960's:  93 days.  I could probably have gone two more months.

2865,"Chris Pratt and Anna Faris Are Definitely Raising a Theater Kid

Chris Pratt and Anna Faris’s four-year-old son, Jack, is growing up in what is, essentially, an immersive-theater class. When Pratt spoke to Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show Friday, he said that he and Faris, both professional actors, take parenting, specifically story time, very seriously.

“We’re strangely competitive with each other when it comes to entertaining him and getting into the characters,” he said, before recounting a recent bedtime-story moment: “We were reading this book, and I’ll start affecting a little accent for the character, and then she’s like, ‘Oh,’ and she starts gesticulating and laughing.”

Pratt said that Jack seemed to pay no interest to his parents’ competing dramatics. But when some version of method acting is happening in your bedroom every night, it’s pretty difficult not to pick up on it.

It helps, too, when your parents trick you in to making an everyday occurrence something out of Lee Strasberg’s lesson plan. When Jack was just three, Faris told Conan O’Brien that she was teaching her toddler to have big, stage-worthy, emotional reactions to everyday events.

Jack seems to come by some very valuable talents naturally, though. In a 2015 interview with Ellen, Pratt told the talk-show host that he often comes to his young son for sound advice. He shared a story of how Jack picked up on tension at a family holiday gathering.

“He says amazing things, profound things,” Pratt said. “I was sitting down and I said, ‘You know, Jack, there's a lot of people here, and it’s very loud, and people are gonna be having a lot of fun. And there might even be some tension.’ And he just said, ‘It’s family.’ I almost started crying. I was like, ‘Thank you, son; you’re right.’ He’s like my therapist.”

Jack is clearly already a perceptive kid—another essential trait for a successful career in theater. Combine that with his parents’ affinity for inundating him with classic Hollywood films, and his acting career will be blossoming before we know it.

1824,"""Well, I am not trying to pick a fight ) but I have NPOV issues with this article.  It reads  at the moment  like a celebration of scientific progress.  I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.

One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.  I'd hope a good article on """"the history of science"""" would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.

I am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views.

I am glad Ed has begun this article, it can be really important and it is a needed contribution.   SR

 More description of location please? 

Hello, I wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence, maybe in the description section, to explain where this bridge is? I do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things X and Y but if you don't already know Stockton well (or recently!) this is not necessarily all that helpful. I was wondering if you could write a more bottom-up description which says something like """"the bridge crosses the Tees at blah (or near Blah Street etc); it is A hundred metres downstream from the Foo Bridge and B hundred metres upstream from the Bar Barrage"""" or whatever, which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. What do you think? Any yes, of course the maps link does nail it (assuming the co-ordinates are right!) but something in the text which helps in this way would, I think, be very useful. I may be being unusually thick  (happens all the time, actually) but on my first reading - and I was last in Stockton in 2007, you see - I was not at all sure where it was, wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. I cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps, yes, but the sentence I'm asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg.

A pretty awesome playdate! Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron revealed that they both brought their kids to work while they were filming The Huntsman: Winter’s War, and it totally changed the dynamics of the set.

“There was a whole difference of energy on this because we all had our kids there on set a lot of the time,” the 32-year-old Aussie actor, who is reprising his role as the Huntsman, said during a press conference for the sequel to Snow White & the Huntsman. “Normally, the set being this sort of tense, respectful, quiet sort of place. That was just thrown out the window when the kids came. They were chasing each other around with the weapons and yelling, ‘Get him!’ ‘Kill her!’ ‘Do that!’”

“We’re raising them really well,” the Oscar-winning actress, 40, joked about her parenting of son Jackson, 4, and daughter August, who she adopted last July.

“Taught them how to survive in a vicious kingdom,” the Thor star added of his daughter, India, 3, and twin sons, Sasha and Tristan, 2, with wife Elsa Pataky. By the looks of the movie poster — Hemsworth is holding two hatchets — the little ones had some pretty fun and realistic-looking props to play with on the set of the fairy-tale film.

Their fellow costar Emily Blunt, who is currently pregnant with her second child, didn’t chime in about whether she let Hazel, her 2-year-old daughter with husband John Krasinski, run around on set, but she did say she left the fight sequences to the kids. “Charlize and I spent our time hobbling around in high heels going, ‘My feet hurt,’” recalled the actress, who plays rival sister Freya to Theron’s Queen Ravenna. “That was, like, the extent of our actions … [costar] Jessica [Chastain] would, like, come into the makeup bus just pouring with sweat from some awful stunt coordinating.”

Weeks after Selena Gomez was spotted on regular dates with Justin Bieber following her split from ex boyfriend The Weeknd, The Weeknd has now been seen holding hands with Justin Bieber's ex, Yovanna Ventura.

On Friday night, the Canadian crooner and Ventura were seen arrived at French Montana's birthday party together in Los Angeles, with sources confirming to US Weekly that the musician spent the majority of the night cosying up to Bieber's former love interest.

'The Weeknd was there hand in hand with Yovanna Ventura all night,' a source told the publication.

'They arrived together. They were holding hands. He was there for a solid two hours with her and everywhere they went they held hands.'

Another source said: 'He was parading her around. He was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the entire night.'

If this isn't a snub to both Gomez and Bieber post break-up, we don't know what is.

The 30-year-old's PDA with Ventura comes amid news Selena 'liked' an Instagram photo of her ex, at the party, sending the 'Fetish' singer's fans in a full-blown meltdown.

Mentioning Darwin gave up natural selection and became a Lamarckian

The article currently makes no mention of the historically important fact that Darwin himself converted from the natural selection theory of evolution to a Lamarckian environmentalist position in later editions of The Origin of Species, which went into 6 different editions by 1872. Hence I propose the following insert at the first Darwin quotation in the current section ‘Publication of the theory of natural selection’, which I also propose should be retitled ‘Publication of the Darwin’s theory of evolution’.

Proposed insert:

'However,  even in the first edition of his book Darwin only claimed natural selection was the main means of selection, but not the only one. In the last sentence of its Introduction he said “Furthermore, I am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.”

But by 1872 he had published six editions of the book with corrections and revisions, and in later editions in response to criticism of his theory of inheritance Darwin even gave up the theory of natural selection as the main selector of evolution, with its strong principle of inheritance, in favour of Lamarckian environmentalism, with a changing environment as the main selector. As C.D. Darlington wrote in 1950 in his Foreword to a new and first reprint of the otherwise unavailable first edition of The Origin:

""""Let no one imagine, however, that, in the world of science, Darwin's theory has enjoyed an unchequered prosperity. On the contrary the dust of battle is only now beginning to settle on the hotly disputed ground....The most abiding source of trouble was that discovered  by the Professor of Engineering at Edinburgh. Professor Fleming[sic] Jenkin pointed out in 1867, that any new variation appearing in one individual would be lost or swamped in later generations when that individual was compelled to cross with others of the old and established type, and its differences, as Darwin believed, blended in inheritance. Nature would never be able to keep any differences to select. 

Darwin's defence against this objection was already prepared. He had hinted it in the first edition of The Origin of Species: at the end of the Introduction he had said that """"Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification."""" In later editions he hedged further. He fell  back on the other means. These depended chiefly on the action of a changing environment: its direct effect in altering living things so as to suit it must be inherited. In adopting this view Darwin was giving up his own, and Wallace's, peculiar claim to originality: he was giving up the argument implied in the title of the book: and he was falling back on the discarded and disreputable theory of Lamarck."""" 
[p. xvii On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection first edition reprint in The Thinker's Library by Watts & Co, 1950.] '

But Darlington failed to establish Lamarck's theory was discarded or disreputable. In fact the theory of natural selection only became accepted in the mid-20th century with the ‘Mendelian-Darwinian synthesis’ in population genetics. But even by 1950 Darwinism was still not accepted in academia according to Darlington:

""""In view of the triumph of his ideas it might be thought that Darwinism, in all civilised countries, would be taught as one of the foundations of thought, that in the universities everywhere it would be critically expounded and experimentally developed. That is true of its remote and general applications to such sciences as astronomy and geology. But where, as in its applications to ourselves, in the study of the genetics of men, and to the histories of nations, as exact knowledge of the principles of variation, hybridization and selection is required, we hear on every side nothing but confused and ignorant speculations. At the same time the foundation of Darwinism in the experimental study of evolution has largely been smothered in Darwin's own country. The Universities, with their museums and botanic gardens, are happy to forget what, in 1859, they were unable to resist. They contain no memorial of his work,  and all the means of developing his doctrine they frustrate by an arrangement of teaching which the theory of evolution is not allowed to disturb. The old pedantic learning of botany and zoology, which Darwin treated as one subject, they continue to cleave asunder, burying the halves under their ancient schedules of instruction."""" [‘’ibid’’ pxviii-xix]. '

His 1859 book ‘’On the Origin of Species’’ posited natural selection was the main selector in the evolution and origin of species, but by its 1872 sixth edition Darwin had abandon",0

I should indeed have stated explicitly that traditionalist women are, I think, less likely to go to Mass wearing pants than without a veil, and so the question of pants deserves to be listed among traditionalist practices as much as the question of the veil.

2850,"Wild Rumor: Justin Bieber Canceled His Purpose Tour to Start His Own Church

Justin Bieber shocked the Belieber community worldwide yesterday when he abruptly canceled the remainder of his Purpose tour. Bieber had 14 shows left, including several in the U.S. and Asia. A photographer caught the Biebs yesterday in L.A., and he explained he just needed a break after 16 months of touring. ""Yeah, everything's fine, yeah"" he told the man on camera. ""I've been on tour for two years. It is [a long stretch,] yeah. Yes, [I'm looking forward] to resting, getting some relaxation, I'm going to ride some bikes.""

He offered this message to his fans: ""I love you guys, I think you guys are awesome. Sorry for anybody who feels like disappointed or betrayed, that's not in my heart or anything. And uh, have a blessed day!"" Then he gave a peace sign.

His manager Scott Braun also posted an Instagram, explaining Bieber ended the tour for his own well being. ""On behalf of myself, Justin, and the team, we are sorry,"" he wrote to the hurt fans. ""That was never our intent. But a man's soul and well being I truly care about came first and We must all respect and honor that. Justin will be back and I know he looks forward to performing for you and with you all again. One chapter ends and another begins. Thank you again. ""

But! Australia's Today Show had an interesting report of another reason Bieber ended the tour early. Apparently the Biebs, who famously attends Hillsong Church, has a ""Son of God"" tattoo across his chest, and was recently at Hillsong Conference with his friend Pastor Carl Lentz, wants to start his own church. An inside source told a reporter that the reason ""he came off the road is because he wants to reconnect with his faith, and he may be even planning to start his own church. We know that he was in the country [Australia] a few weeks ago having meetings and attending the big Hillsong convention that they had here. Very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he's looking at teaming up with them or something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own, starting his own church, we're not quite sure.""

2744,"Taylor Swift Cries During Selena Gomez's Heartbreaking AMA Performance, Gets Some Serious Side Eye


Taylor Swift was moved to tears by Selena Gomez's debut performance of ""The Heart Wants What It Wants"" at the 2014 American Music Awards.

The country pop star was clearly feeling her BFF's pain, but that didn't stop a few fellow audience members from shooting her some serious side eye. But, hey, T.Swift sang it herself-haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

The ""Shake It Off"" singer went through a lot of emotions during Sunday night's show. When she wasn't crying with Selena, she was dancing with Justin Bieber's on-off love in the audience-and Lorde, too! She also performed her don't-cross-me single ""Blank Space"" for the first time on live TV. She played up her boy crazy, man-eating persona during the fiery (literally!) performance, but she showed her true colors when it came time to accept The Dick Clark Award for Excellence, presented to her by Diana Ross.

""I am blown away to have received an award from Diana Ross, who over the course of her career just stood up for herself so many times in a time when it was not popular for a woman to stand up for herself,"" she said. ""I am so honored. Thank you for coming. You're beautiful.""

""Dick Clark-Dick Clark was a visionary,"" she said. ""He fought for music to be at the forefront of our minds and on our televisions as much as possible. I'm so unbelievably ecstatic that his family chose to honor me and that the AMAs chose to honor me with this.""

She even took the opportunity to speak out on her anti-streaming stance (sorry, Spotify), saying, ""And lastly, you, you guys! To the fans who went out and bought over a million copies of my last three albums, what you did by going out and investing in music and albums, you are saying that you believe in the same thing that I believe in-that music is valuable, and that music should be consumed in albums, and that albums should be consumed as art and appreciated, and I love you so much.""

""I love getting to know you,"" she said, addressing her fans. ""I love talking to you online. I love having a glimpse into your life and I'm so unbelievably happy that you want to have a glimpse into my life. Thank you so much.""

Homosexuality in Ancient Greece

Do homosexuals like you get turned on at the thought that these great ancient people's may have accepted homosexuality? Why do you have to distort history to fit your image? 

first off there is no concrete evidence that alexander liked it up the butt...let's get that straight...no pun intended

second i'm sure there was gay shit back in the day, like in every culture...but i don't believe everyone was doing it....just because you find two pots out of a 1000 that show some gay act...doesn't mean everyone back then was gay

third...there is a difference between brotherly love and being gay or a pedophile...i say i love my friends and in greece i even kiss them on the cheek when i see them..that doesn't mean i want their ass...look at shaq and wade slapping each other's ass in basketball are you telling me they are gay?

fourth...just because some plays back in the day reffered to certain people being gay...doesn't mean they were...alot of plays (especially comedies) were made to be critical or make fun of people by dehumanizing them or making them look stupid...like calling them gay...just look at comedies now making fun of people...someone might say the president today is gay in a comedy skit, but we all know he is straight

fifth...i hate gay propaganda...i know they are people blah blah blah...but to try to impose on a great culture some of their values to justify their way of life is pathetic...just because there are no great gay people in history doesn't mean you have to ripout pieces of history to make your people look good....from alexander to hitler to lincoln...you guys try to change history or make things up to fit your own cause

i leave with quotes from two authors who wrote gay stuff on alexander

Some modern historians point out that the ancient sources cannot be considered definitive. Robin Lane Fox writes: """"Later gossip presumed that Bagoas was Alexanders lover. This is uncertain."""" [16] And, according to Mary Renault, who wrote a novel about the relationship of Alexander and Bagoas, """"No historian states plainly whether they were physical lovers."""" [17]

key words: uncertain, no historian

Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:

In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. 

[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, """"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."""" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” 

Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. 

If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? 

Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2",1

I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history.

Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use.

 Hahaha 

Check this out:

MickMacNee, an editor with a long history of block for disruptive behaviour [10], seems to have gone out of line in the last days. I don't mind him being defensive of an article he has written the major part about, and several users in the AfD discussion have been very much engaged in it, including myself. However, I object to the repated personal attacks and uncivil behaviour by the editor. His history is rather long, so I provide just a few selected diffs of uncivil comment and direct personal attacks during the last days 11, [12], [13], [14]. In the discussion on this page about a third user, he calls my arguments for not agreeing with him """"""""evasion, obfuscation, interuption and intentional deafness"""". That is rather typical of his attitude in the AfD discussion where he agressively drives that everybody disagreeing with him are wrong. I've tried to point it out to him, [15] but with hindsight (given our infected history) it might have been better not to as I should have predicted how he would respond.[16] However, I'm far from alone in having that opinion. In the last days, several other editors have also commented on his behaviour [17], [18], [19], [20].Jeppiz (talk) 

That block log looks like something out of a Wiki-horror story...why has he not been given long blocks in the past? I would go for a longer-term block. Ks0stm (T•C•G)  
A users block log is not (generally) an excuse to throw the book at him, this looks a bit silly if you ask me, a bit of a tit for tat heated discussion over a article for deletion discussion that is split down the middle, and nothing will come of it, I can't find a really uncivil comment, perhaps if you guys just edit different articles for a few days. Off2riorob (talk)  
It goes without saying that everybody has different opinions, but I do think that """"one of the nastiest and most repugnant editors"""", """"Either your comment was simply ignorant of the facts (like you characterisation of my POV), or you are simply trolling, either way, you are all out of credit here tbh"""", """"I've got no idea what crappy papers you read"""", """"It's up to you if you want to parrot everybody's delete opinion as if it makes you look like you know what you are on about, but it really doesn't."""" are not particularly civil. Neither is """"I have had it with your crap."""". In any case, I won't interact with the user again, I rather leave Wikipedia. As I pointed out, I'm far from alone in having made these observations.Jeppiz (talk)  
Off2riorob, I tried your suggestion, in fact I didn't think I'd need to try, I didn't think I'd cross paths with Mick after this bout of abuse. But sure enough I did, and when I reported him for violation of a 1R measure in place on the Northern Ireland article, half of his defence was an assumption of bad faith against me. I guess if someone keeps an eye on him, he can't get too far out of hand. Alastairward (talk)  
It is a bit of a rant, he is clearly very upset about the footie, and I am sorry you have been upset Jeppiz, he has gone now, probably off to bed, I'm sure one of the admins will have a strong word in his ear when he shows his face again. I myself have had a run in with him but he has grown on me, what can I say. Off2riorob (talk)  
Seeing the diffs Alastairward provided, I cannot agree, even though I see that you stood up for him that time as well. This is a user who seems unable to deal with conflicting views and routinely resorts to personal abuse.Jeppiz (talk)  
Nothing routine about it. Your behaviour and Alistair's are pretty similar, which is why they provoked similar responses eventually. If either of you wish me to lay out the full package of evidence for either of your extraordinarily sustained campaigns of tendentious behaviours, I am only too willing to oblige. MickMacNee (talk)  
First of all, Alistair and I are not the only editors you've attacked and insulted, there are at least Grsz [21] and Kevin McE [22] just in the last few days. 
While I have definitely argued with you, I have not called you one of """"the most repugnant editors"""" [23], called your contributions """"crap"""",[24] called you a """"lying hypocritical cunt"""" [25] or told you to """"fuck off"""" [26], [27]. 
Every time someone brings your behaviour to the attention of administrators, you come up with these vague and unsupported accusations that ones you've argued with have behaved in the same way. It is not a defense (then both should be blocked), and it's not true either, just a dishonest way for you to try to talk you out of it. I'm getting tired of having that same accusation thrown at me all the time and I take it as",1

As her wedding plans for her nuptials to Egor Tarabasov continue to take shape, an insider has revealed to OKMagazine.com that Lindsay Lohan may be making a major move following the ceremony!

The source said that the actress is considering moving to Russia to live with Tarabasov.

""She's always had this major fascination with Eastern Europe and loves the idea of getting to embrace a new, non-Westernized culture. On top of that she's desperate to meet Egor's rich family and prove to them that her intentions are honorable,"" the source said.

The insider added, ""What better way to do this than by moving to their country and embracing their traditions? Egor's thrilled, but nervous because he worries what many of his family and friends back home will think of Lindsay.""

The latest updates on her wedding plans come after another source told OKMagazine.com that Lindsay has been feuding with her parents, Dina Lohan and Michael Lohan, over her nuptials!

""Lilo's at war with her family, with mom threatening to boycott the wedding if her dad's there,"" the source said.

Do you think Lindsay and Egor should move to Russia following their wedding? Tweet us @OKMagazine or let us know in the comments section. The source continued, ""Lilo hit back in frustration and banned the whole lot of them, so now her sister and brother aren't talking to her either.""

Sanjay also believes that Lord Krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for 7 days and nights and defends scriptures that say the Lord Vishnu (a male) transformed himself into a woman (Mohini Devi). So it appears that Ekantik and Sai Devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned. I can't help to wonder why Ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself.

Selena Gomez’s pooch is making her happier than ever and he’s helping her heal with ‘love and support’ after her kidney transplant, an expert revealed to HL EXCLUSIVELY. Find out why a dog’s affection is so magical!

Selena Gomez, 25, and The Weeknd’s, 27, puppy is more than a furry friend! The singer’s precious new pooch Charlie, an adorable Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, is likely helping Selena cope and heal after her kidney transplant. “They’re super smart and sweet, and I can definitely understand why she would have one as an emotional support animal as they bring a lot of love and comfort and they cuddle very well,” Certified Dog Trainer, Elisha Stynchula shared with HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “The King Charles Spaniel is such a beautiful dog especially as puppies. And, they won’t get any larger than about 20 pounds, so again, they’re amazing for cuddling.” Click here for more pics of The Weeknd and Selena.

“The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is bred to be a companion,” she revealed about the breed’s behavior patterns. “I see that they are prone to separation anxiety because they bond very strongly with their humans. They’re essentially lap dogs, though they wouldn’t quite fall into the Toy category. Carrying it with her everywhere will make it tough for it to leave her if she ever needs to leave the house because they do get very attached.” Selena was last spotted holding tight to her precious brown and white dog on Sept. 15, while leaving the Chelsea apartment she shares with her loving boyfriend.

The “Fetish” singer recently made a heartbreaking confession, admitting that she received a kidney from her BFF, Francia Raisa, 29, over the summer and that’s why she was MIA. Due to her battle with Lupus, she had to get the surgery to improve her health. While she heals, Selena and The Weeknd have been loving getting to know their new pup and they’ve clearly formed a bond. He even shared a hilarious video of Charlie chewing on his sneakers and joked, “not the kicks fam.” As we previously reported, The Weeknd majorly stepped in to be a support system for Selena, so she’s surrounded by love!

Hollywood power women Ellen DeGeneres and Charlize Theron are heading for a showdown over Portia de Rossi.

“She really looks up to Charlize and loves her salty language. Ellen showed up on the set when Charlize guest-starred before [in season three].

“You can bet she’ll be poking her head around again, keeping an eye on things during any of Charlize and Portia’s scenes together this season.”

To make DeGeneres even more paranoid the Atomic Blonde star has been hanging out with controversial Chelsea Handler recently after her friendship with Jennifer Aniston cooled.

RadarOnline.com revealed that DeGeneres and her wife got involved in a big bust-up at a Hollywood Hills party over the summer – so Theron might seem like more of a threat than ever right now.

They've broken free of the White House bubble and they're not looking back.

Barack and Michelle Obama have been keeping busy since leaving office nearly two months ago, and as the former president's new go-to leather jacket might suggest, it's been more play than work (although they've also managed to squeeze in book deals, surprise school visits and meetings on Obama's presidential library and foundation).

As the former first couple have been settling into their new 8,200-square-foot home in Washington, D.C., they've been exploring the city in a whole new way, including a recent visit to the National Gallery of Art that ended with a round of applause from fellow museum-goers.

This was also the first time Obama was spotted wearing his sleek brown leather jacket and new and improved dad jeans - both of which have earned rave reviews from the PEOPLE style team.

RELATED VIDEO: Barack Obama's Favorite Jackets Have One Thing In Common

But the Obamas have also been making plenty of time for travel.

Their adventures started on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, when they took their final flight aboard an Air Force presidential jet - straight to Palm Springs. After spending the weekend there with daughters Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, the former president and first lady continued on their own to Richard Branson's private island retreat in the British Virgin Islands.

The couple spent 10 days on the Virgin Group founder's Necker Island, where the former president tried kitesurfing for the first time - on a dare from his pal Branson.

""We decided to set up a friendly challenge: could Barack learn to kitesurf before I learned to foilboard?"" Branson wrote in a post on the Virgin website. ""We agreed to have a final day battle to see who could stay up the longest.""

More recently, the Obamas visited New York City, where they had lunch with musician and activist Bono at Upland restaurant in Manhattan.

A source told PEOPLE at the time that, as Bono and the Obamas walked out of the eatery, ""the whole restaurant stood up and applauded and cheered for them. Barack Obama waved at everyone upon leaving.""

And as he has in all of his post-White House outings, the former president looked relaxed and happy as he left the restaurant with a wide smile, wearing a sleek black suit and white shirt with the top few buttons undone.

FROM COINAGE: This Is How Much It Would Cost to Paint the White House (And More Crazy Facts)

While in town, Obama also took his older daughter, Malia, to dinner and a show. The father-daughter duo dined at Emilio's Ballato, an Italian restaurant in Soho, before attending a revival of Arthur Miller's The Price on Broadway, starring Danny DeVito and Mark Ruffalo.

They even popped backstage to meet some of the stars.

Obama's new life also gives him plenty of time for one of his favorite pastimes: golf. During his first post-presidency trip to his native Hawaii this week, Obama played a few rounds of golf at the Mid Pacific Country Club and took in a meal at Buzz's Steakhouse in Kailua - all with minimal security.

Obama wore a white polo and blue shorts for his golf outing, as well as his new favorite accessory: a big grin.

2778,"Angelina Jolie Opens Up to PEOPLE About Her 'Difficult' Year: 'I Am a Little Bit Stronger'

Much has changed over the last year in Angelina Jolie‘s life, but one thing has remained constant — her dedication to her children.

After filing for divorce from Brad Pitt on September 19, 2016, Jolie retreated from the spotlight to focus on her family as they work to heal from the traumatic split.

“I have had my ups and downs. I guess I am a little bit stronger,” the actress, director and philanthropist tells PEOPLE exclusively in an interview for the magazine’s new cover story. “We all have our difficult times, but as a mother you also have a responsibility first and foremost towards the kids. They are going through their formative years and everything else comes second to that.”

With her children — Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne and Knox, 9 — by her side, the superstar, 42, is back at work promoting First They Killed My Father, a movie she directed for Netflix (debuting Sept. 15) based on her friend Loung Ung’s memoir about surviving the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia.

For all the details on Jolie’s new life, her emotional movie First They Killed My Father and her hopes for her kids, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.

Jolie confirmed she plans on taking on more acting roles in the future, including Maleficent 2, but says her priority remains her children and their well-being.

“Everything will be around the children,” she says. “I haven’t worked for over a year now because they needed me home. Everything was just stopped. I’m really sitting and talking with them because everything affects them. Every location, every type of project, I’m going to have to adjust it to however much they can handle.”

In the interview, an emotional Jolie also talks about how she misses her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who died of cancer 10 years ago, more than ever —and says her own health is good “so far” after her preventative surgeries to lessen the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

She’s very proud that Maddox and Pax got involved behind the scenes on First They Killed My Father. The movie grew from her longtime love for Cambodia, where she adopted Maddox in 2002 and where she has done humanitarian work for 14 years, establishing a foundation in Maddox’s name that helps local communities with education, health and more. “I wanted Maddox to see how extraordinary his country is,” she says of the movie.

Though they are still healing from the last year, the star says her family is out of “lockdown” and ready for new adventures.

“I think they’re itching to get out in the world again,” says Jolie. “We’ve all been a bit in lockdown and going through some things. I think it would be good to get out there and play together.”

In an effort to win Harry’s heart, Kendall has made it clear that she’s laying it all out on the line — her body that is — and wants the world to see. “Her friends are all talking about how she’s trying to impress Harry by flashing her boobs and wearing risque top,” a source told OK! exclusively. “She’s never gotten over Harry Styles, and would take him back in half a heartbeat if he showed even the faintest interest.”

Share this article with Google Plus

Tyra Banks made her debut as the new host of America’s Got Talent.

Tyra takes over from ex-presenter Nick Cannon, and she appeared on the show – which is basically a US version of Britain’s Got Talent – for the first time on Tuesday.

And the America’s Next Top Model star made quite the entrance as she strutted through the crowd handing out high-fives.

She joins judges Simon Cowell, Mel B, Howie Mandel and Heidi Klum on the 12th season of the show.

As Simon introduced her, Tyra got a standing ovation from the audience and joined Mr Cowell on stage.

Tyra said: ‘I am so excited to be standing next to this sexy man.’

The star contestant of the night was 12-year-old ventriloquist Darci Lynne Farmer from Oklahoma City.

Her act, with a rabbit puppet called Petunia, impressed Mel so much that she made Darci her Golden Buzzer act.

As an overwhelmed Darci burst into tears Mel joined her on stage and gave her a big hug.

Simon said that he would remember her ‘in a week, in a month and in a year.’

He added: ‘When you’ve got it, you’ve got it.’

Hopefully Tyra remembers which show she’s hosting in the next episode.

In a blooper reel shown on America’s Got Talent, she slipped up and got the names of her programmes – AGT and ANTM – confused.

‘Did you hear what I just said?’ she said in the outtake. Well they both sound really similar…

Tyra debut episode also featured a chicken who can play the keyboard. No really.

By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",1

2646,"Are Kendall, Kylie Jenner and Gigi, Bella Hadid headed for a nasty feud?

It looks like a case of siblings' war. Two of the most popular siblings' duo – Kendall, Kylie and Bella, Gigi – are reported to be on the verge of a nasty feud.

The shocking claim comes days after Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner were spotted attending Cannes and vacationing together. But what went wrong? It appears that the Jenner mother, Kris Jenner, is to be blamed for the spiteful dispute.

According to a report by Star, the Jenner sisters and Hadid sisters are at war and Kris Jenner is fuelling the surprising conflict. Apparently, mom-manager has designed a plan to make her daughters, Kendall and Kylie, the next ""it"" girls of the fashion industry by replacing the Hadid siblings.

A source told the gossip website that Kris is ""setting the stage"" for a nasty fight between the young models. The outlet also claims, ""[Kris] is hell-bent on getting a contract for either Kendall or Kylie with Tommy [Hilfiger], like Gigi currently has.""

Adding to the speculation, the source explained, ""The bottom line is the Hadid girls have that 'it' factor, but try telling Kris. She will stop at nothing to make sure her children succeed. She's determined to have her daughters in the top spot.""

The claims sound dubious considering the fact that all the four stars are successful in their respective ways and have been closest of friends. This led to Gossip Cop reaching out to their sources to find out if the claims are true. As it turns out, the Star's claims are not true.

Gossip Cop writes, ""Kendall and Kylie are not at ""war"" with Gigi and Bella, nor is the matriarch plotting to have her daughters overtake the Hadids in the fashion world. What's more, the four stars are actually the best of friends, and any claims made otherwise are completely unfounded. They're not in competition with each other, but extremely supportive of one another. There is no feud between the sister pairs, but just the opposite.""

It comes as no surprise that this claim was false considering the bond Kendall, Kylie, Bella and Gigi share.

Bella and Kendall, accompanied by Kylie, were recently seen at the New York Fashion Week together where Kendall turned photographer for Bella and took a beautiful picture of the Victoria's Secret model.

2698,"Justin Bieber's 'Purpose' show at Barclays Center lacks focus

Justin Bieber may need to work a little harder on his focus.

Sure, keeping it together on a massive outing like his ""Purpose"" tour night after night is tough. So it's understandable that his mic was at his side Wednesday night when he was supposed to be singing, making it clear that he was lip syncing for at least part of the show.

And there were points when he was standing still while his phalanx of 12 dancers were around him.

But Bieber forgot to sing his most recent No. 1 single ""Love Yourself"" in the middle of his show.

""I got a little ahead of myself,"" Bieber said, as the stagehands rushed to return the sofa they had already removed as well as tuning his acoustic guitar again. ""Should I skip it?""

Of course, the capacity crowd screamed ""No!"" And, to his credit, Bieber, a little red-faced, delivered a strong version of the song.

Though Bieber pulled his career out of a tailspin with the recent string of three No. 1 hits from his album ""Purpose,"" his concert at Barclays Center Wednesday night showed that his career rebound hasn't solved all his problems. (Bieber returns to Barclays Center again Thursday, much to the chagrin of New York Islanders fans whose playoff game is delayed until Friday to accommodate the show.)

The ""Purpose"" tour is quite the spectacle, with its multilevel stage and elaborately choreographed routines. But Bieber ends up being the center of attention and, at times, the weakest link.

He opens the show in a massive glass box, and in one of the night's best moments, dances in a circular video screen that looks like he's trapped in a cage. No need for college-level performance art classes to figure out what that means.

The show has its moments. With the upbeat ""Get Used to It"" seeming primed to be his next chart-topper. Bieber looks energized when he's doing flips on a giant trampoline during ""Company."" And the tropical-tinged dance numbers like ""What Do You Mean?"" and ""Where Are You Now?"" hold up well, giving his faithful fan base plenty to scream about. They want him to succeed and most everyone loves a comeback.

But before that becomes a secure possibility, Bieber needs to find his ""Purpose"" a little more interesting.

Forget what you heard: Glenn Close has not pipped Meryl Streep to play Hillary Clinton in an upcoming movie about the former Secretary of State and presidential hopeful's life.

Rumours were swirling that Close had been chosen over Streep to play Clinton in the film, reportedly due to the latter's outspoken, albeit very pro-Hillary, political opinion.

Digital Spy reached out to both Glenn and Meryl's representatives for comment on the matter, with Glenn's spokesperson confirming to us that the rumours were definitively ""not true"".

So that's that, then. It looks like Streep still has a shot at The Iron Lady vol. II after all.

Related: Glenn Close says her new zombie movie is ""more of a character-driven thriller"", actually

Even if Streep doesn't end up taking on the role of Clinton, there is still a political title on the horizon for the ""overrated"" Oscar-winning actress. (They're Trump's words, not ours, btw.)

In an epic team-up with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, Streep will star in The Post, a film set to dramatise The Washington Post's publication of the so-called Pentagon Papers, a classified survey that proved the US government publicly lied about key aspects of the Vietnam War.

Tom Hanks has signed on to play legendary newsman and Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee, while Meryl will play the paper's publisher Katharine Graham.

2551,"Brad Pitt Is Running Back to Jen Aniston During His Divorce From Angelina Jolie (EXCLUSIVE)

As Angelina Jolie continues to twist the knife in Brad Pitt's heart amid their impending divorce, the 53-year-old actor is running back to his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston for support, In Touch has exclusively learned. A year after Angelina, 42, blindsided her husband of two years with divorce papers, the actress got candid with The New York Times, seemingly suggesting that her six children are better off without their father.

""[They're] the best friends I ever had,"" Angelina said of her children Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. ""Nobody in my life has ever stood by me more.""

Aside from shading her ex-husband for his lack of support, Angelina also subtly implied that the kids are doing just fine, even without Brad. ""None of it's easy,"" she continued. ""It's very, very difficult, a very painful situation, and I just want my family healthy. They're getting better.""

Angelina's public talk of their marriage's demise and smearing of his parenting skills and reputation is enough to send Brad right into the arms of his ex, 48-year-old Friends star Jen. Though she married fellow actor Justin Theroux in 2015, Brad's former wife of nearly five years seems willing to be there for her ex-husband.

""[He] wants and needs Jen in his life,"" a source tells In Touch exclusively, ""especially during this trying time."" Justin, 46, isn't worried or the least bit threatened of Jen's friendship with her former beau. ""Brad wouldn't dream of breaking up Jen's marriage,"" the source reveals. ""Brad's leaning on her as a confidante now. His renewed friendship with Jen has been a huge source of support and comfort through the toughest year of his life.""

""Overall, Brad and Jen have a great deal in common,"" another source says, ""and have reached a level of closeness and understanding that they never thought was possible.""But not everyone is comfortable with Brad and Jen's newfound kinship. Angelina has reportedly gotten wind of Brad's new confidante and is none too happy.

""She's furious,"" a source reveals of Angelina's reaction. ""Jen's always been Angelina's greatest rival when it comes to Brad. She hates the way that she has always been depicted as the evil femme fatale and Jen as the girl-next-door victim in the famous love triangle.""

Meanwhile, Jen is allegedly reveling in Angelina's sour reaction. ""She's getting her well-deserved revenge,"" says the source. ""Jen feels Angelina lorded her relationship with Brad over her all these years. Jen's having the last laugh. She loves the fact she has become his confidante.""

Exactly how Brad won over Jen as a friend is no real mystery. Earlier this year, he revealed his excessive binge-drinking to GQ — ""I was boozing too much,"" he said at the time — and has since decided to quit drinking and issue apologies to all those he wronged. Seeing as Jen ""was the person highest on his apology list,"" as the source says, he called her last June and offered his sincere regrets.

""Brad flat-out apologized for all the heartache and pain he caused by leaving her for Angelina,"" the source continues. ""He came off as genuinely sorry and Jen was deeply touched. She was completely won over.""

One more in-depth conversation was all it took to cement their friendship. Brad opened up to Jen about the infamous plane incident last year in which he allegedly got physical with Maddox while intoxicated. He also got candid about the custody battle that's still ranging on present-day.

""He soberly spoke about hitting rock bottom,"" the source says, ""and how he made the climb out. He launched into a grand apology. He apologized for being an absentee husband in the marriage — being stoned and bored much of the time. He also made amends for being an avoider, getting lost and in a serious drinking-and-getting-high phase when he fell for Angelina while making Mr. & Mrs. Smith.""

The conversations re-instilled Jen's faith in Brad's sensitivity. In 2005, she infamously remarked that Brad was missing ""a sensitivity chip."" But it seems with these recent, heart-felt dialogues, his chip has been restored in Jen's eyes.

""He told Jen they might still even be married if he were emotionally and physically present and sober at the time,"" the source says. ""It was the most intimate conversation Brad had ever had with Jen.""

The rekindled friendship could even spark some future collaboration. ""Brad wants her involved again,"" says the source, ""and Jen wants in on such prestige projects.""

""Jen has a way of calming and encouraging Brad, which he needs in his hectic life right now,"" the source continues. ""He's in a great place mentally and physically. He's in touch with his emotions and his true self like never before. He is closer to the kids than he has been in months, and he's shown tremendous maturity and patience with Angelina concerning the divorce.""

She's known for her comedic routines and never-ending dance moves.

And Ellen DeGeneres is also known for sharing sweet nothings about the one she loves most, her wife.

The 59-year-old comedian posted an image on her Instagram account to celebrate nine years of wedded bliss with Portia de Rossi on Wednesday.

Ellen captioned the black and white photo: '@PortiadeRossi and I got married 9 years ago today. Being her wife is the greatest thing I am.'

The brides both wore custom Zac Posen designs for their backyard wedding in August 2008.

Nearly two hours after the romantic image was posted to Ellen's account, nearly 800,000 users had liked the image.

Thousands of fans chimed in to give celebratory comments to the happy couple on their anniversary, including a post from musician Joshua Radin.

The musician posted an congratulatory image to 'two incredible women' on his Instagram account Wednesday morning.

'Nine years ago today, these two incredible women got married and asked me to sing some of my songs to them while they were celebrating their most special day. It's still one of the most fun things I've ever done. Happy anniversary @theellenshow and @portiaderossi,' Radin wrote in his Instagram post.

DeGeneres surprised her new bride during their wedding with an acoustic performance by Radin.

In an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine for her September cover story, Ellen professed her love for her wife of nine years.

'She understands me completely,' DeGeneres said. 'She loves me for everything that I am. She supports me and makes me happy.'

On August 6, 2010, de Rossi filed a petition to legally change her name to Portia Lee James DeGeneres

Furthermore, all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question: that is, since Lenin's Communist regime was good (major premise) and the Kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime (minor premise), suppressing the rebellion was justified.

2652,"Kathy Griffin feels ‘betrayed’ by Anderson Cooper after CNN firing

While Kathy Griffin continues her sympathy crusade after weathering a storm of criticism for her terrible Trump severed-head photo, sources say she’s seething about how Anderson Cooper dropped her from his CNN New Year’s Eve broadcast like a hot potato.

Sources said Griffin had expected CNN “golden boy” Cooper to stand by her, but the news network swiftly announced she was fired from the NYE broadcast with Cooper, which they’ve done together for 10 years.

TV insiders say respected newsman Cooper had no choice but to condemn Griffin’s disturbing photoshoot, in which she held up a faux severed and bloody head of President Trump.

After the controversial image of Griffin went viral, sparking widespread backlash, Cooper tweeted, “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.”

But a source said, “Kathy totally misjudged this. She truly believed that Anderson would stick up for her. She considered him a friend. While she has nobody to blame but herself, she feels somehow betrayed.” Griffin appeared in a tearful press conference Friday where she sobbed of Trump: “He broke me.” No word about Cooper.

The buzz at CNN is that Cooper could use the opportunity of Griffin’s firing to bring his longtime buddy, Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live” star Andy Cohen, into his NYE broadcast. Cohen also hosts “Love Connection” on Fox.

The source said, “Anderson wants Andy to co-host with him. They are already doing a multi-city tour together, they are besties and have a great rapport.” Cohen revealed that they were set up on a blind date in the early ’90s, but Cooper says Cohen blew it during their initial phone call by being “too enthusiastic.” They were later introduced by mutual friends in LA and their platonic bromance blossomed.

But sources add that Cohen “may have some contractual problems to overcome” with Bravo before he can appear on CNN with Cooper.

Reps for Bravo, Cohen and CNN declined to comment.

Some larger ideological groups may contain a cultic core or special formations organized in a cult-like fashion (according to some accounts, the Third International operatives from various countries in the 1930s were treated virtually as cult zombies by Stalin's cynical bureaucrats). Arguably, Himmler's SS included cultic formations trained at that castle (Wewelsburg?) where they supposedly performed something called the ceremony of the stifling air (possibly this is a street legend). As to North Korea it is definitely a totalitarian state with an intense leader-cult religion (probably the most intense such formation that has ever existedone hesitates to describe it as a Stalin-style personality cult since even Stalin never strove for such a level of quasi-religious worship and regimentation).

Hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article.  The relationship (if one can call it that) between Hagee and McCain was much more remote and brief than that between Obama and Wright.  Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but Obama-Wright-TUCC is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life.  If Hagee turns out to bedevil McCain as much as Wright and TUCC has affected Obama, it would merit inclusion here in this main McCain article.  There are hundreds of other items in the sub-articles also. Picking out just Hagee to add to this main article, and not picking out those other hundreds of items, would cause undue weight. This article is about McCain's whole life, not just the current campaign, and in the context of his whole life Hagee is just not very significant. If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about McCain's 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about Hagee). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut.  Right now, some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his Vietnam service before the shoot-down, or more on McCain-Feingold, or more on his relations with the Republican Party in the early 2000s, as compared to more about Hagee.",0

2559,"Tom Hiddleston Stunned Taylor Swift Referenced Him On New Album: Here’s Why

While most of the people who are or were in Taylor Swift’s life most likely knew they’d be called out on her album, Tom Hiddleston thought he was safe! But, is ex mentioned him in TWO tracks! Here’s what he thinks …


Tom Hiddleston, 36, was shocked to learn that Taylor Swift, 27, dropped some bars about their relationship on her new album, “Reputation“. But, come on, Tom; anyone’s fair game in Tay land. The singer referenced her ex on two tracks — “I Did Something Bad” and “Getaway Car”. And, since the pair didn’t split on bad terms [or so we thought], he was under the impression that he would’ve gotten a get out of fail free card when it was time for Tay to pen a new album.

“Tom was not expecting to be a part of Taylor’s album,” a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “He thought they were on good terms,” our insider says, adding, “After their break-up, he was always asked if he was worried she was going to write about him, and he always said no. But everyone’s saying she did and he’s stunned. He genuinely thought he was going to get spared.” Well, maybe next time, Tom.

As soon as Taylor’s sixth studio album dropped, at midnight on Nov. 10, fans instantly began dissecting each and every lyric, as did we! And, here’s what we came up with. The first Tom reference came on her track, “I Did Something Bad”, which is actually about two men who made a mark on her 2016 year. The first verse is a nod to Kanye West, 40, where she sings about a “narcissist” who “talks sh-t.” Then, Tom came in. In the second verse, Tay sings about a “playboy” who she flew “around the world” with before she broke up with him. Well, she and Tom flew to Italy in the beginning stages of their relationship. Then, the song references to this man spending all of her money. And, when Tay and Tom were together, it was speculated that he was with her for her fame. So, you can decide.

The second Tom reference on “Reputation” came on the track, “Getaway Car”, which happens to be the only breakup song on the album. This track references both Tom and Calvin Harris, 33. In the beginning of the song, Taylor sings about wanting to get out of one relationship, but she doesn’t have a “reason.” Then, when she goes to an event where “the ties were black and the lights were white,” she found her reason — a new man, aka, Tom. In case you forgot, Taylor and Tom were first linked when they were seen together at the Met Gala… the home of black ties. Not long after the Met, she split with Calvin and ended up dating Tom. Coincidence? Nah. THEN, when the chorus comes around, Tay points out that the new relationship didn’t work out, and that the person [Tom] should’ve known how things would end, because of how they got together in the first place. And, again, you can decide. For a complete guide to every song and its hidden meaning, check out our full breakdown here.

Taylor and Tom were first linked at the Met Gala in 2016, as mentioned above. They even attended a pre-Met dinner at the home of Vogue‘s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, 68. Exactly one month later, she and Calvin split; and, two weeks after that, she and Tom were photographed in Rhode Island together. And, the rest was history, until they split just three months later in Sept. 2016.


HollywoodLifers, tell us, do you love Taylor’s new album?

The lede is supposed to encapsulate the rest of the article which is quiet clear that this was a murder - not an accidental, natural or judicially sanctioned death.

I do sympathise and understand that for Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA, the current phase of the conflict is about the definition of the conflict itself. For the self-esteem of the so-called republican movement, and for the political future of Sinn Féin, it is vital that its 30-year campaign of violence be remembered as a just war, a regrettable but necessary method of achieving a legitimate aim. The vile and sordid deeds that run through that campaign may, under pressure, be described as wrong. They may be accepted as """"mistakes"""". PIRA may acknowledge, in the curiously passive language it favours, that these things """"should not have happened"""". But they must never, ever, be called crimes. God forbid!

RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that Tyga owes his ex-sugar mama Kylie Jenner millions of dollars! ""Kylie had been bankrolling Tyga for well over a year and she's finding herself short on cash as a result,"" an insider revealed.

The reality teen quickly got a harsh lesson in fiscal responsibility when she ""begged"" him to start paying her back.

""He was shocked when she asked to be paid, telling her he thought the money was a gift, not a loan,"" the insider said. ""He's a total loser and owes her over $2 million.""

However, 26-year-old Tyga's shock was nowhere near the surprise Kris Jenner got when her 18-year-old daughter broke the news.

""Kylie had no choice but to admit it all to Kris, who absolutely hit the roof,"" said the insider. ""She threatened to go after him if Kylie didn't ditch him.""

""She was always helping him, paying his legal bills when he was getting out of his record contract and she funding most of his latest album, which flopped,"" continued the insider.

""Kris now wants her on an accountancy course because she's obviously completely clueless about money.""

response to your nasty personal attacks, Blockader and Blah
'You people are unbelievable in your ignorance and the ease to which you get brainwashed by subversive propaganda.
 Learn to read. I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would  be protected. Have you read Paine and Jefferson? You are attacking the wrong men. If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and others.
 I never said they were anarchists. I do say, though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism. If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him. (Something that many of them wanted to do anyway.)
 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now. I personally would love to overthrow the fascist-socialist state we're in right now and get back our freedom. But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom.

Comic Jim Carrey is secretly a follower of a kooky conspiracy nut who believes alien reptiles run the world! Even nuttier, the Dumb and Dumber star plans to go public with his commitment to whack job David Icke’s bizarre theory!

“Icke has spent years wooing Jim, and it’s finally paid off. Jim is now a disciple of this guy!” claimed a source.

The crazy coupling helps explain Carrey’s bizarre behavior during New York Fashion Week when he declared he “didn’t exist.”

Icke, a 65-year-old former soccer player, is a British broadcaster and author who frequently raves about the Illuminati, the legendary secret society aimed at global domination and populated by the alien reptiles.

When confronted about his screwy convictions, Icke said: “For 26 years I have taken untold f–king s–t and ridicule from people who don’t know their arse from their elbow. I didn’t and I don’t have any regrets!”

An insider tattled: “Jim’s into all of Icke’s weird theories. He’s studied his speeches and dispatches to the very last letter.”

“He goes to as many of Icke’s public appearances as he can — often in disguise — to avoid any attention,” continued the insider. “He’s mesmerized by everything Icke says!”

Insiders told Radar The Mask star wants Icke’s unhinged gospel spread to the masses — and his way-out Fashion Week outburst may be the first sign of more manic preaching to come.

“It’s a big reason why Jim ranted on the red carpet,” the source spilled.

An insider says that Brad didn't have the former Friends star's contact information, but tracked down her cell phone number through a ""tangled web"" of mutual friends in order to wish her a happy birthday on Feb. 11. His birthday well wishes sparked a conversation between the exes.

Those with leftist agenda cannot be considered neutral observers due to their denial of genocide and open one-sidedness with Serbs and/or Milosevic, see Znet resource for example. When you mention """"Bosniak sources"""", who are you referring to? Do you consider the International Tribunal a """"Bosniak source""""? Srebrenica massacre is heavily based on Internationa Tribunal's rulling (e.g. Radislav Krstic judgement), and you are trying to destroy the article by inserting revisionist 'garbage' with the purpose of morally equivating victims with aggressors who committed genocide. The bottom line is: Alternative views do not matter, what matters is cold-harded facts from such sources as International Tribunal, Human Rights Watch, State-sponsored Research & Documentation Centre, International Missing Association (or whatever the official name is) etc. When it comes to editing this article in a """"rational matter"""", you are the only one who rejects International Tribunal's version of the article and seeks Serbian (or pro-Serbian) version of the article.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.",1
2563,"Mariah Carey’s manager was always hungry for fame

Long before she managed Mariah Carey, Stella Bulochnikov was a standup comedian.

Going by her married name, Stella Stolper, the tough-talking Russian native competed on Season 4 of “Last Comic Standing” while pregnant with her second child.

In a clip from an episode that aired June 20, 2006, she jokes about her pregnancy, telling the crowd, “I love the babies! I want to have more kids, really, I do! I just can’t take the pain, and the nausea and all that weight. And I’m not talking about the nine months of being pregnant, I’m talking about the two minutes the old man’s on top of me.”

Why Mariah Carey's manager is more like a 'dictator'
Unfortunately for Bulochnikov, the audience couldn’t take her jokes: She was voted off in the same episode.

Her efforts at comedy stardom may lend credence to rumors that Bulochnikov, an experienced TV producer and the mastermind behind “Mariah’s World,” is eager for her own fame.

“Stella is the one who really wants to be the reality star. She even filmed a pilot for herself last year,” an insider who used to work with the self-proclaimed “Russian dictator” previously told Page Six. “This will likely be more of a TV launching vehicle for her. It’s going to be like the Stella show, which is what she’s always wanted. She is definitely very much out for herself, and this is a golden opportunity for her because she wants to be famous. She wants to be the one in the magazines.”

The source added, “Stella is the furthest thing from a manager. She’s a TV producer. She’s practically moved in with Mariah and now she has so much stuff on her that she can get her to do anything. She’s pulling the strings, and Mariah does whatever she says.”

In ,page 24, 

Theoretically, polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms: polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time, polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men, and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women.  Of these, only the first is common.

And on page 25 

A statistical analysis of Kaingang genealogies for a period of 100 years showed that 8 per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages, as compared with 14 per cent for polyandrous, 18 per cent for polygynous, and 60 per cent for monogamous unions.

The disadvantage of working at a medical school is that the anthropology texts are not extensive, but they aren't checked out often either. This had been sitting on the shelf for over 20 years, deep in the recesses of the basement. Murdock is a sufficient reference for polygamy including group marriage.",0

Oh, baby! Beyoncé, who’s pregnant and expecting twins with husband Jay Z, took to Instagram on Memorial Day, Monday, May 29, to show off her baby bump in an adorable photo featuring their 5-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy.

In the pic, the pop superstar — dressed in a blue bikini and matching sheer cover-up — blows a kiss to her little girl who she’s holding. For her part, Blue rocks a printed one-piece, a straw hat and, yes, even a few golden flash tats. Queen Bey captioned the post with a smiley-face and an American flag emoji.

This isn’t the first time Beyoncé has put her baby bump on display via social media. On May 21, the “Formation” singer uploaded several snapshots of herself baring her sizable bump in a barely there top and a flowing skirt from her star-studded baby shower in Beverly Hills.

Beyoncé announced her second pregnancy via Instagram in February. “We would like to share our love and happiness,” she captioned a stunning shot of herself, dressed in lingerie and a long veil, holding her baby bump on a bed of greenery and brightly colored flowers. “We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes.”

Earlier this year, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Bey and Jay, 47, had been making a strong effort to expand their family of three for a while. “They have been trying for a long time and now to be blessed with twins they are so over the moon,” the insider said. “It’s even better than they wished for.

As The National ENQUIRER has reported, Miranda froze out Blake after he wasted no time hooking up with his fellow judge on “The Voice.”

“It infuriated Miranda that Blake started dating this gorgeous pop star before the ink was even dry on their divorce papers,” a close pal of Miranda tattled to The ENQUIRER.

Refusing to let any grass grow under her boot heels, Miranda began dating Anderson in December 2015, five months after splitting with Blake.

2544,"Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Maybe Got Secret-Married Last April

In September, Miley Cyrus told The Sun on Sunday that she and her fiancé Liam Hemsworth had no wedding plans anytime soon. ""I don’t envision marriage,"" she told The Sun on Sunday. ""I’m 24. I hope to get to live a little bit more. I have too much living to do [before I get married]."" (Her mother Tish Cyrus made the same point when asked about a rumored Miley-Liam elopement in June, too.)

But, if this wild rumor from Australia’s NW Magazine is true (via The Sun and The Daily Mail), the lack of wedding plans may just be because Cyrus and Hemsworth already had their wedding. In April. A source told the outlet that ""six months ago, way back in late April,"" the two secretly had ""a very intimate ceremony at their house in Malibu. I'm told only a handful of people were there and they're still the only ones who know."" Hm…

Cyrus was first spotted wearing a wedding band-like ring in July.

She was recently photographed with Hemsworth wearing her band with her engagement ring:

Hemsworth was first photographed with one in August.

But People reports these are just promise rings. ""He [Liam] wears that ring as more of a 'promise' to Miley, but they are not officially married,"" a source told E! in August when Hemsworth's ring first debuted. ""The only thing that is missing is the legal piece of paper. The pair is not focused on planning a wedding at this time. They are more focused on making their love as strong as possible.""

But, given Hemsworth also publicly denied being engaged to Cyrus when Cyrus was probably engaged to him and definitely wearing his engagement ring in April 2016, only those two really know what’s going on.

It's officially over: Reps for both Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth confirm to PEOPLE exclusively that the engagement is off between the two stars.

The news marks the end of a tumultuous year in which Cyrus, 20, and Hemsworth, 23, have experienced more break-ups than bonding moments.

The couple – who first met on the movie set of 2010's The Last Song – got engaged in May 2012. At the time, the singer told PEOPLE, ""I'm so happy to be engaged and look forward to a life of happiness with Liam.""

But earlier this year, the pair decided to postpone their wedding.

Cyrus was subsequently seen out without her 3.5-carat Neil Lane engagement ring but soon it was back on her hand and the couple were reunited in July in Canada, where Hemsworth was shooting his new movie Cut Bank, and on the red carpet for his movie Paranoia in August.

Since then the couple seem to have been living separate lives as the ""Wrecking Ball"" singer continues to plug her album Bangerz and Hemsworth prepares to promote Catching Fire.

Reps for both stars had no further comment.

(Recent article/talk page history: , ). You haven't edited the article since 2007  and you must have  thousands of  other articles that need improvement on your watchlist.  

You could have posted an article edit request to the PL noticeboard  re this, as you have for many articles during the past few months.

2861,"Ben Affleck Has Reportedly Started Training For The Batman

If you have been worried about Ben Affleck’s place in the DC Extended Universe, then you can breathe a sigh of relief. Over the last few months, fans of the actor’s take on the Gotham vigilante have grow increasingly worried about whether Affleck would return to the role. A series of blips concerning Batman’s impending standalone movie were enough to make the most confident of fans second-guess Affleck’s longterm commitment to Batfleck. In fact, some were even worried the actor would back out of The Batman entirely after Affleck stepped down as director.

But, if one inside scoop has anything to say, then Affleck is still down to reprise Bruce Wayne for the solo venture.

Earlier today, noted DC Comics insider Umberto Gonzalez dropped some Batman scoop in an episode of Heroic Insider. It was there the reporter said Affleck has started a new training regiment to get him ready for The Batman. “Ben Affleck, Batman, I just got word that he just started training again for the role. You know how there was talk that he was gonna leave and he might leave the role? Nah, bro. He’s working out. He’s getting back in shape,” Gonzalez told fans.

Of course, there is no official confirmation about whether Affleck’s new workout schedule adheres to such a promise. Still, it seems more and more likely that Affleck will return to the superhero role. Excitement for Justice League continues to mount ahead of its fall premiere this year, and the introduce of Matt Reeves to The Batman has fans fired up as well. In a recent interview with Daily News, the director admitted he’s been a Batman fanboy for years, and Reeves seems partial to Affleck’s darker take on the character.

“It’s a strange thing to be involved in the two franchises which were the two that I was connected to most as a child,” Reeves said. “I just was obsessed with Batman when I was a kid. What I find so interesting about him as a character is that, as far a superhero goes, he’s not superhuman, he is a person. And he is a tortured soul who is grappling with his past and trying to find a way to be in a world that has a lot that’s wrong with it and trying to find a way to reconcile all of that.” In Justice League, fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.

 Justice League is directed by Zack Snyder, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio, based on a story by Snyder and Terrio, and stars Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Amy Adams, Willem Dafoe, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J. K. Simmons, and Ciarán Hinds.

THEY BOTH REALLY SUCK! Watch something worthwhile like Family Guy or King of the Hill.
That was really mean. Family Guy and King of the Hill are good shows, but so is KP. Don’t get hostile. =D  
One of the things that make the show unique is that it is a comedy aimed at more than just kids, that doesn't revolve around a cliched 'loser' main character. In fact KP is the complete antithesis of a loser and so are her family and most of her friends. Even Ron doesn't really fit the stereotype. Both FG and KOTH can be funny but there comes a point when you want a break from all those cynical shows that are all about laughing at someone's ignorance and stupidity.  
Hey wait a second. Totally Spies sucks. Kim Possible was good, but later jumped the shark. it then became the worst show ever (well, not as bad as totally spies or futurama, but got close). Also, as for another comment above, Teenage Robot  was AWFUL. Robot Jones was way better. And as for the final one, King of the Hill was great, but Family Guy is unfunny. It is better than Futurama though, FUTURAMA WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING EVER MADE!!!!

Taylor Swift Goes Naked in '...Ready for It?' Music Video Teaser
2017-10-23T10:51:15-05:00
Nope, definitely not ready for this! Taylor Swift released a 15-second teaser for the music video for her new song “…Ready for It?” on Monday, October 23.

In the clip, the Grammy winner, 27, struts down a hallway with a hood covering her head. She then turns into a badass robot and fights off a group of bad guys. Oh, and she’s completely naked during it all (or at least wearing a nude-colored bodysuit). The intense preview is filled with lightning, magic and action, and casts her in a dark, superhero-like light.

“…Ready For It? Official Music Video out Thursday night. #ReadyForItMusicVideo,” she captioned the teaser on all of her social media accounts.

Swift released “…Ready for It” on September 3, just a few days after premiering “Look What You Made Me Do,” the lead single from her upcoming sixth studio album, Reputation. The electronic song, which was first teased during a Sunday Night Football broadcast, peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making it Swift’s 22nd song to land in the top 10.

The “Shake It Off” singer later released a love song titled “Gorgeous” on Friday, October 20 — and she has plenty more on the way. A source exclusively told Us Weekly earlier this month that Reputation “chronicles her feuds” with longtime foes Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry and ex Calvin Harris. “It will be across multiple songs, somewhat cryptically, but also obvious,” the insider told Us. A second source described the highly anticipated album as “her most experimental work yet in terms of sound,” adding, “She’s definitely coming for the Grammys.”

2700,"'Au revoir for now': Kate and Wills bid a fond farewell to Paris after wowing the French during their two-day Brexit charm offensive 

Duke and Duchess of Cambridge waved goodbye to Paris after their successful two-day tour 
Earlier they cheered on Wales as they played their final Six Nations match
To the dismay of the royal couple, France scored in the 100th minute and converted to win 20-18 
They also met with victims of Nice and Bataclan terror attacks at military hospital as part of their tour 
Next they visited the Musée d'Orsay where they rekindled their love of art in the Impressionists' Gallery  

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have bid a fond farewell to Paris after wowing the French people during their two-day Brexit charm offensive.

In a cheery final message before departing, a Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'What an incredible two days in Paris! Thank you to everyone who made the visit so memorable. Au revoir for now!'

Kate was handed a posy of lilac flowers by a pair of schoolchildren before the royal pair headed back home to the UK.

Earlier they endured a nail-biting finish to the Six Nations rugby today when victory was snatched from Wales after twenty minutes of overtime at the Stade de France.

Kate looked a picture of elegance in a double breasted Carolina Herrera coat and flashed a beaming smile as she chatted to William when the players entered the pitch.

As The Dragons took the lead the future Prince of Wales finally looked back in his comfort zone after appearing awkward since he was filmed dancing 'like a dad' in a club in Verbier, Switzerland earlier this week.

But he looked a bag of nerves as France pushed for the line in the dying seconds and Wales desperately held on in a bid to secure the win. To his dismay, France scored in the 100th minute and converted to win 20-18.

The couple were watching Wales' final Six Nations game as part of their two-day tour to Paris. This morning they met with war veterans and victims of the Nice and Bataclan terror attacks at the famous Les Invalides military hospital.

They then visited the Impressionists' gallery at the Musée d'Orsay before playing rugby with some French youngsters outside the Eiffel Tower. The couple will be flying back to the UK early this evening by private jet.

While attending their engagements this morning, the royals were but 10 miles from the scene of a shooting at Paris's Orly airport.

But they are unaffected by the airport's closure as it is understood that the couple had always intended to use a different airport to get home.

The Duke and Duchess arrived for their first engagement in the centre of the city on time this morning and there was no obvious sign of increased security.

Kate was wearing a chic Chanel suit - a choice bound to delight fashionistas - in muted shades of black, grey and burgundy, with her hair loose, courtesy of her personal hairdresser, Amanda Tucker, who is travelling with her.

On her feet were a favourite pair of block-heeled burgundy Tod shoes, a more practical choice for the Paris cobbles than her normal high heels.

William and Kate were first visiting Les Invalides, an iconic French military hospital in the heart of the city.

They learnt about the important historic and current roles of the site, in particular its work supporting veterans undergoing rehabilitation programmes.

The Duke and Duchess also met victims and emergency service teams from the Bataclan and Nice terror attacks.

Among those they met were Jessica Bambal Akan, 25, who was shot seven times in the leg, hip and back as she dined with friends at La Belle Equipe restaurant in Paris.

There was also Kevin, a 28-year-old fireman, a concert-goer at the Bataclan, who was shot in the leg. Both have been undergoing rehabilitation at the hospital ever since.

Jessica said the encounter meant a great deal to both, who have found it invaluable to speak about their trauma and prove to the public that life goes on.

William told the Bataclan attack survivors: 'We think you are very strong and very brave, you've made amazing progress.'

The Duchess added she would be keeping an eye out for Jessica's work, after learning she is retraining to work in fashion.

Jessica, 25, said: 'At first [after the shooting] I was a bit shy and didn't want to talk about it because of all of the pain and grief.

'But now I want to say we are not only victims, we have lives, we have boyfriends, girlfriends, work. I want to speak about my friend who died to honour him, I want people to remember who he was.'

She was shot on her birthday as she dined with three female friends outside the restaurant, who all survived the attack. Her friend Victor Munoz, who was inside, was killed with one shot.

'We were very lucky,' she said of her friends outside. 'We all got shot and we all survived.'

The prince hailed the 'quick-thinking' of her boyfriend, who made a tourniquet for her leg on the scene.

'It's been very difficult,' she said. 'I like to move. I got through this because of my friends, my boyfriend, my family who helped me all the time.'

The Duchess asked how she had found readjusting to life after the accident.

'You feel like you're in a dream,' Jessica said, adding that she had tried to view her rehabilitation work as a job in the week, and enjoy her weekends as she did before.

She used her convalescence to learn Italian, and is now hoping to work organising fashion shows, telling the Duchess she had noted her Chanel outfit.

'I was ambitious, I am still ambitious,' she said, speaking in English. 'If I want revenge I must live and work and prove they [the terrorists] can't touch how we live in our great country. It sparked something: I realised you need to live.'

Kevin described how he attended a concert at the Bataclan, only to hear shouting and gunfire. They started shouting at the audience and opened fire.

'Anyone who shouted was shot, so I tried to be as quiet as possible. I was hit twice in the leg but lay there and kept quiet.'

Of meeting the Duke and Duchess, he said: 'It was a very positive experience because I was able to speak about this experience and what I went through.

'It feels very important to tell these stories and be listened to.' Asked how his emotional recovery had been, he told the Royal couple: 'It gave me a challenge, I like a challenge.' The Duchess said: 'You're a very brave man.'

The couple also spent time with the elderly inhabitants of Les Invalides, including one 101-year-old man who escaped the Nazis three times during the Second World War.

The Duchess was charmed by Colonel Jean Camus, 100, and Chief Petty Officer Georges Zwang, who will turn 102 in May.

Both reached for her hand to kiss it as they were introduces, prompting a smile from Kate.

Col Camus fought in France in 1939-40, was taken prisoner by the Germans, escpaed, joined the French resistance and escaped twice after being captured by Vichy forces and the Germans.

He managed to reach London in 1943 and served as an intelligence officer in the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Operations, before returning to France in August 1944 for the end of the war.

As they were introduced, the Duke exclaimed: 'As escape artist!' The veteran joked: 'I spent most of my life in jail. I could write a book.' The Duke replied: 'You should, it would be a bestseller.'

Col Camus added: 'I didn't expect to live so long, it's a surprise. I'm very glad to see you living and not on pictures as I saw the Queen and Charles. Thank you for listening.'

The veteran told the couple his wife had been made an MBE but the now suffers from Alzheimer's and could not make the journey to meet them. The Duchess said: 'Please send her our best wishes.'

They were also introduced to Chief Petty Officer Georges Zwang, who will turn 102 in May, served in the French navy from 1934-1940 and went on the join the Royal Navy. He then joined the Free French Forces and took part in the landing and battle of Provence where he was seriously injured.

Captain Stephane, from French Special Forces, severely injured during Operation Serval, joined them, along with Mrs Montcorge, 94. She was a lieutenant in the Free French Forces in 1943 in London and was appointed as liaison officer to General Patton commanding the 3rd US Army from June 1944 to the end of the war in 1945.

She told the Duke and Duchess she had been appointed after studying in the US.

Moving to the prosthetics room, the couple met Sergeant Phillippe, who was training in the French army as a dog handler when he had motorcycle accident in France leaving him with one prosthetic leg.

He has previously met the Duke, who presented him with medals at the Invictus Games, where he won a gold in the 100m and silver in the 200m in 2014, then a gold in the driving challenge and bronze in the 100m in 2016.

The Duke said: 'You are a huge inspiration for all the other guys.'

They also met two servicemen suffering from PTSD, to be known as Kevin and Francis, who discussed their mutual love of football and tonight's rugby match.

The Duke and Duchess, who was wearing a Chanel coat, were greeted by General Ract Madoux, governor of Les Invalides, who introduced them to a short history of the hospital, built in 1670 by Louis XIV for his veterans.

Today, Les Invalides houses around 80 pensioners, with a cutting-edge prosthetic department helping wounded servicemen and women.

William and Kate were also shown an ornate book, explaining how Charles II, king of England, wrote to Louis XIV to ask him to share with him the plan about the creation of the hospital.

It went on to inspire the foundation of the Royal Chelsea Hospital.

The Duke of Duchess of Cambridge rekindled their shared love of art today when they visited Paris's iconic Musee D'Orsay.

The couple first met when they both studied history of art at St Andrew's University in Scotland (although William later switched to geography) and were keen to visit the museum which houses the largest collection of Impressionist masterpieces in the world.

In a tender moment William and Kate even looked out onto the world's most romantic city through the face of a giant clock.

The couple toured the gallery on the second day of their two-day visit to Paris.

It remained open to the public throughout, prompting gasps from tourists who crowded round to take pictures and videos of the royals on their phones.

Home to some of the greatest works of French and European art produced in the 19th and 20th centuries, they had specifically asked to see one some of Claude Monet's most famous paintings including one of his water lilies series, painted in 1904.

The French impressionist painted around 250 oil paintings of the flower garden at his home in Giverny, which were the main focus of his artistic output during the last 30 years of his life.

The couple were also shown other Monet masterpieces, including his 1873 work Coquelicots or wild poppies and his 'parasol' paintings from 1886 titled, Essai de figure en plain-air femme a l'umbrelle. They stopped to take a close look at London, Houses of Parliament, which was inspired by Monet's 1871 visit to London when he was struck by the 'effects of fog on the Thames'.

William, 34, asked director Laurence des Cars: 'This is one of his most famous paintings isn't it?'

The 1904 masterpiece will go on loan to the Tate Britain later this year as part of an exhibition called: 'The Impressionists in London'.

The couple were also shown Monet's La Rue Montorgueil a Paris, a 1878 painting of a street which the Queen visited during her 2004 tour of France.

Art enthusiast Kate, 35, who graduated with a 2:1 in 2005, asked lots of questions, particularly about Edouard Manet's Olympia, a nude painted in 1863. Seemingly unfazed by the topless scene, William pointed to a black cat in the picture and was told it was a tongue in cheek addition.

Another painting that caught their eye was Gustave Caillebotte's Raboteurs de Parquet (1875) featuring half-naked men sanding a floor by hand.

A keen photographer, Kate has been patron of the National Portrait Gallery in London since 2012 and is also patron of a charity called The Art Room, which encourages disadvantaged children to express themselves through artistic endeavours.

Kate once said: 'I am a firm believer in the power of art to make a difference'.

William, whose father and grandfather are both keen artists, also studied history of art before switching to geography.

It is thought that Kate's support in convincing him to switch subjects rather than quit university altogether is what first drew them together.

Situated on the left bank of the Seine, the Musee D'Orsay is houses in the former Gare D'Orsay, a Beaux-Arts railway station built between 1898 and 1900.

It holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1914 including works by Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cezanne, Gaugin and Van Gogh.

Having been used as a railway station for more than 80 years, the decision was taken to close it down because its platforms were deemed too short for modern trains. In 1970 permission was granted to demolish the building but after an eight year row it was finally placed on the list of historic monuments and former French president Georges Pompidou gave the go ahead for it to be turned into an art gallery. It opened in 1986, with its original clocks remaining as a reminder of its transport heritage.

A man was shot dead at Paris Orly airport this morning after taking a soldier's gun and fleeing into a shop, taking aim at soldiers.

Less than two hours earlier, three police officers were shot at in a suburb in northern Paris by a gunman during a routine stop-and-search operation.

Police now believe the shooting in the northern Paris suburb of Stains, which left one officer injured, was carried out by the man who was later killed.

After fleeing the scene, the man stole a woman's car at gunpoint.

2417,"Kristen Stewart Drops 'Twilight' Movie Plans With Robert Pattinson: Lands New Role In 'Underwater' Thriller | Celeb Dirty Laundry

It looks like Kristen Stewart won't have any time on her hands to make another 'Twilight' movie with Robert Pattinson in the near future. In fact, new reports indicate that the Hollywood star has just landed a new role in the psychological thriller, 'Underwater.'

According to Deadline, the film is about an underwater scientific crew that struggle to survive after an earthquake. Kristen will star as Noah, a woman who ends up in a relationship with another crewmember. And while there have been reports suggesting that Kristen might reunite with her ex-boyfriend Robert Pattinson for another 'Twilight' film, at this point it doesn't look like it's going to happen.

Then again, many fans believe that one of the reasons why there will never be another 'Twilight' movie made again is because Robert Pattinson doesn't want to work with Kristen Stewart again. After all, she absolutely humiliated him right before their break-up in 2012. Robert was devastated when he found out that Kristen was having a secret affair with director Rupert Sanders behind his back. His trust issues with Kristen would make it hard for the two to ever work together again.

Plus, Robert Pattinson has moved on with FKA Twigs. He doesn't want to deal with the tabloid media and even more unnecessary rumors about his personal life. Meanwhile, Kristen is dating model Stella Maxwell. The last thing Robert wants is to be involved in a messy and complicated love triangle with his ex and his current girlfriend. He wants to concentrate on his Hollywood career and not the gossip magazines that write about his love life.

But for Kristen Stewart, she doesn't feel that way. She loves the attention she gets whenever her name is in the headlines. She even mentioned earlier this month that she would be open to filming another 'Twilight' movie if the script and timing were both right. She even told reporters that she would be the first person to read it, too.

What do you think of Kristen's new role in 'Underwater?' Does this mean that she's putting her 'Twilight' days behind her for good? Let us know what you think by dropping us a line with your thoughts in our comments section below.

Katie Holmes praises her daughter Suri Cruise in a special note included in the credits of her new film.
The 37-year-old's directorial debut All We Had follows the story of a single mother's relationship with her teenage daughter, who tries to get her life back on track by moving to a small Midwestern town.
Holmes, who directs and stars in the movie, said the storyline is one every mother can relate to, and was one of the reasons she was so excited to join the project.
""The mother-daughter theme (of) that unending love that you have for your mother and for your child is universal,"" she told Entertainment Tonight.
And her 10-year-old daughter Suri, who she shares with ex-husband Tom Cruise, helped her to fully understand the mindset of Holmes' character Rita, which is why she gets a special thanks at the end of the film's credits.
""She gets a special thanks for everything, (for) every job I do, because she makes every day great and awesome and better,"" Holmes shared. ""I know myself better because of her, so she'll always get a special thanks.""
The actress, who shot to fame as Joey in Dawson's Creek, revealed it took a long time for her to fulfill her dream of getting behind the camera.
""It's taken a long time to take the risk,"" she said of her directorial debut. ""I feel fortunate because I have a wonderful support group around me.""

2596,"Elsa ‘upset’ by Chris’ gushing about Charlize

They seem to have crafted the perfect life for their family in Byron Bay but things are reportedly not 100% happy in paradise for Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky.

According to NW, Elsa is not happy about her husband “gushing” about Charlize Theron (again) in a recent interview.

The Thor star had nothing but good things to say about the actress while speaking to W magazine.

“She’s smart as hell,” Chris raved about his Snow White And The Huntsman co-star.

An insider told NW: “If Chris is smart, he’ll stop talking Charlize up in public.”

“Elsa knows that he’ll never cheat, but a part of her does find it upsetting for Chris to be talking about Charlize so publicly when they’re not even promoting a film together. It’s more than a little disrespectful,” the source added.

Chris’ comment follows the praise the 33-year-old had for Charlize back in April when he said: “She’s incredible…She’s one of my favourites.”

Even KIISFM host Kyle Sandilands noticed the admiration Chris had for Charlize pointing out they haven’t worked together in four years “and the guy’s still talking about her. I bet that wife has a problem…”

However, Chris and Elsa both regularly gush about their relationship.

The couple relocated their family to Byron Bay a few years ago and their romance seem to be better than ever.

They have been married for seven years after meeting in 2010 and tying the knot just months later.

Chris and Elsa have three kids together five-year-old India and three-year-old twins Sasha and Tristan.

2461,"'Jessie J's 100% gay ... but bi is more trendy'

POP beauty Jessie J is 100 per cent lesbian, an explosive book claims.

The Voice judge, 24, was ordered to hide the truth by record bosses to avoid

 turning off male fans, the unauthorised biography says.

They advised the star to say she was a bisexual who liked boys AND

 girls, because that was trendy.

But the sensational book alleges the singer-songwriter has not had a

 boyfriend since realising she was a lesbian at 17.

The book, Jessie J: Who's Laughing Now, says Jessie took the advice of music

 executives because she was scared of losing her Universal record deal.

Author Chloe Govan says: ""Jessie might have been with boys in the past - but

 she is 100 per cent gay. Jessie was openly lesbian and didn't hide it.

""She was advised not to come out, though. Certain people thought being bi was

 trendy, exotic and a fashion statement. It would increase her allure.

""Being gay would alienate people. They knew how important image was and asked

 her to tone it down a bit.

""There are so many homophobes out there, they feared a career-damaging

 backlash.""

Jessie - who admits fancying fellow singer Rihanna - is said to have been

 ""incensed"" at having to compromise.

She said in a recent interview: ""If I meet someone and I like them, I don't

 care if they're a boy or a girl.""

The book, out today, also talks about Jessie's battles with her health and

 bullying she faced.

When she was 11 she learned she had the heart condition Wolff-Parkinson-White

 syndrome. It can speed up the heart rate to four times normal.

Jessie had a stroke aged 18 but never let her illness get in the way of her

 ambitions.

She even took ballet lessons while wearing a heart monitor.

She was also prescribed beta blockers - but was picked on when their side

 effects turned her pale skin a greenish tinge.

Mr. Davis,

Thanks for your note on my talk page; I really appreciate it, and it's an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book.  As this article's creator and main editor, I'm sorry that you thought the review section was so negative.  Please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that I was in any way trying to disparage your book.  In my rush to get the article published, I did a google search and those are the reviews I found.  Also please understand that this is a Wikipedia article, and the article as it now stands will never be """"complete"""".  It's a work in progress.  I thought an article about Street Gang was important enough to get out there.  I am by no means a professional writer, so I'm certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it, so I depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors.  I would've thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work.  I appreciate your feedback, something I always welcome as a Wikipedia editor.  If you are aware of other sources that I wasn't able to locate, please send them my way, on my talk page.  I'll repeat this message via your webpage, to ensure that you see it.

You should also know that I've taken it upon myself to improve all Sesame Street-related articles on Wikipedia.  It's a big project, and a great need.  For example, Sesame Street, at one point was actually a featured article, but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons.  It's an unfortunate state at the current time.  Your book came out shortly after I took on the project, so it's been a boom for me.  I thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start, so your book has been a valuable resource.  I've already started working on this article: History of Sesame Street, and if you look at the reference section, you'll see that I've used your book extensively.  It's also a work in progess, and no where near finished.  My goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by Sesame Street's 40th anniversary in November.  I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.

On a personal level, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your book.  It was a fun read, and immensely interesting.  I was brought to tears many times, especially when I realized while reading about all that Joan Cooney and her team did to get the show on the air.  See, I'm turning 45 this year, which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it.  I had to put the book down to compose myself when I realized, """"They did all that for me!""""  I appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly, and now the life of my own children, who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as I did and still do.  I believe that Sesame Street deserves high quality articles on Wikipedia, and I've taken it upon myself to help accomplish that.  If you, as the ultimate expert, could assist me in that goal, I can't tell you how valuable that would be.  Again, thanks for the feedback and communication.   """,0

Unfortunately, judging from previous """"warnings,"""" some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are. Pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect  and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a Request for Admin proceding, as pointed out by several editors at the time  certainly cannot be considered a personal attack. Pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack (and it has, in fact, been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once). 

Frankly, if you are looking for personal attacks, try yourself for your AGF-violating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals, or David Gerard for claiming that I am """"trolling"""" when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others. It's very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things.

If you want to start blocking for incivility, I might suggest removing David Gerard for a while for his actions, or Elonka for falsely claiming that I was using sockpuppets or that I was harassing her, or the sysop whose very talk page says he's going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after I caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page.

 Greek love 

I'm looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess. I'm leaving a note here because you closed this AfD, where I made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available , so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp). I complain here about their coordination. Other editors, including  and I simply can't do it any longer. I haven't changed my position on the validity of the article, but I've been accused (on various talk pages, and never the appropriate notice boards) of edit warring, ownership, disruption, and even pedophilia by implication, all for trying to carry out what the community decided. I'm done. I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present, and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. When I've made a commitment, though, it grieves me not to keep it. I'm not asking you to do anything: I'm just explaining why I can't keep my word as given at the AfD.   

Wow, that is a mess.Certainly no hard feelings  on my end, it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article. I have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill, not only here but in the real world. Sometimes your presence, despite your best intentions, is harmful rather than helpful, and sometimes a dispute just isn't worth it anymore. Best of luck in your future endeavors here.

I'm not that bothered but I think that the Mailchimp speedy deletion was a mistake.  It did cite that it was one of the more important email marketing programs so it was stating the importance - something that was supposed to be the original problem.

2668,"Melania Trump 'will wear Ralph Lauren at her husband's inauguration'

Ralph Lauren is the latest frontrunner in the race to design Melania Trump's inauguration outfit, Women's Wear Daily reported Tuesday.

The American designer is believed to be creating a gown and an ensemble for the future first lady, according to the magazine. Melania previously wore a $4,000 white Ralph Lauren pantsuit on Election Night.

Lauren also became Hillary Clinton's favored designer during her own presidential campaign. He designed the famed white pantsuit she donned at the Democratic National Convention, as well as several of her other outfits on the trail.

Almost 37.8 million viewers watched Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009. Isabel Toledo, the designer of Michelle Obama's yellow dress and coat, became known worldwide overnight after 25 years of non-mainstream work.

The future first lady could wear the Ralph Lauren outfit during the day and change into the gown for the evening's celebrations, which include a 1,500-people candlelight dinner at Union Station Thursday.

Melania had purchased her Election Night jumpsuit at Ralph Lauren's Madison Avenue store.

Lauren's staff is also believed to be designing pieces for other members of the Trump family, according to Women's Wear Daily.

No further details were provided as to the president-elects inauguration outfit. A source at Brioni, his favored brand of Italian suits, told the magazine they hadn't made a custom outfit for the occasion.

Other designers are believed to have expressed interest in dressing the incoming first lady for her husband's inauguration.

Fashion industry insider Jean Shafiroff, who sits on the New York's Fashion Institute of Technology's Couture Council Of The Museum, told the New York Post earlier this month that Zac Posen, B Michael America, Victor de Souza and Zang Toi would all be willing to dress Melania.

Other designers, meanwhile, have publicly said they would refuse to provide her outfit. They include Tom Ford, Marc Jacobs and Sophie Theallet.

When George and Amal Clooney celebrated their wedding for a second time on Oct. 25, there was once again two very noticeable guests missing - Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were nowhere to be seen!

After years of friendship, it seemed odd for the Fury star to miss his old buddy's wedding - twice! And while he and Angelina were, indeed, filming By the Sea during the original Sept. 27 nuptials, a source close to their family says there's more to the absence than just work commitment. ""They were invited and Brad gave George his word he'd be there,"" the insider explains. ""But Angie vetoed the trip at the last minute. She wanted to pull a power play and dis Amal.""

Both women are invested in humanitarian work, but the first time they crossed paths, in London on June 12, Angie made it clear that Amal was persona non grata - and even blew her off when Amal requested a public greeting in front of photographers. ""Angie feels competitive with Amal,"" the source reveals. ""She has been running from her past for years, and although she's done a fabulous job reinventing herself, she continues to feel like an uneducated outsider.""

Of course, the victims in Angie and Amal's standoff are Brad and George, whose friendship has unraveled in recent years, allegedly due to Angelina's controlling behavior. ""Angie has forbidden Brad to speak to George,"" the insider reports. ""She's walled him off from so many of his old friends that Brad is getting fed up.""

2410,"Jennifer Aniston Pregnant With 'Miracle Baby' At 47? - Report

Jennifer Aniston, 47, has dreamed of becoming a mom for a long time - is she finally getting her wish? Maybe! After all, according to a new report, the actress is expecting her first child with husband Justin Theroux, 44. But are Jen and Justin ACTUALLY about to become new parents? The answer may surprise you!

""She's pregnant,"" a reported friend of the couple revealed to InTouch magazine. ""She and Justin are ecstatic. Jen has wanted to have a baby with Justin for years. Their baby news came at a bad time in her life, too - she just lost her mother, and she and Justin almost broke up. But now this surprise pregnancy has turned the worst of times into the best of times.""

However, we have spoken to Jennifer's rep directly and we've been told that Jennifer is NOT pregnant and the entire story is ""fabricated."" Aw, we can't say we're not disappointed though. Jennifer and Justin WOULD make fantastic parents!

But nonetheless, while vacationing in the Bahamas on a romantic getaway, Jennifer and Justin allegedly looked like the perfect couple. Flaunting their PDA, the two definitely seemed more in love than ever - talk about the perfect vacay. Justin was also allegedly super attentive to his wife, aw!

""The baby has turned him from a guy who didn't seem like he was meant for marriage into beyond supportive,"" the mag's insider dished. ""He was by Jen's side as she dealt with the death of her mom, and he's been waiting on her hand and food in the early days of the pregnancy.""

And while we know now that Jennifer is NOT actually pregnant, we still love seeing this couple get along. It seems like their romantic trip is helping them get closer than ever - and we are ALL for that!

Witnesses did claim that Jennifer refrained from drinking alcohol and smoking while on the island. ""She's dealing with exhaustion and experiencing morning sickness,"" the magazine's insider gushed. ""She's put on about 10 pounds so far."" But honestly, people's weights have a tendency to fluctuate - so just because Jennifer may have gained some weight, doesn't mean she's pregnant.

Tell us, HollywoodLifers - do you wish Jennifer really WAS pregnant? Let us know!

Hi Math. Thanks for the page with the pictures of her art. I find it very interesting. Her pictures of women's bodies as commodities are very disturbing, while her photos of Morrissey are beautiful. I really want to get my hands on the Morrissey Shot book, but I couldn't order it from amazon, apparently they can't ship it to my country.

Anyway, I know what you're talking about, information on Linder and Ludus is very hard to find. Besides the Ludus biography you quoted, I've come across a couple of articles about an exhibition she did in 2000: The Guardian article http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,138286,00.html
and here is a long and in-depth article:
http://www.3ammagazine.com/litarchives/nov2001/manchester_voodoo.html

Her real name is Linda Mulvey. The Guardian article gives info on her date and place of birth (1954, Liverpool) and a bit on her background.

I have some pictures from Ludus sleeves that I might include in the article.

Besides The Importance of Being Morrissey, Linder also appeared in Southbank Show on The Smiths. 

What other magazine articles have you found about her? She's usually mentioned in connection with Morrissey, and even that is very rarely. The only magazine article I can think of is that (in)famous Nick Kent """"The Face"""" 1985 article on The Smiths. There are also a few pages about her in """"The Severed Alliance"""", but it's similar stuff as in that Ludus biography you posted the link to, plus some interesting quotes by Richard Boon and Trotter. Apparently her flat in Whalley Range was sort of a bohemian haven for many musicins and artists. They also claim she had quite an influence over men in her circle, that Pete Shelley wrote Buzzcocks' 'What Do I Get' as a plea of unrequited love for her, and that she inspired a lot of Devoto's early work. Her name also pops up a lot in """"Songs That Saved Your Life"""" - besides Cemetry Gates, she's mentioned in entries for Miserable Lie, Wonderful Woman, Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me (in connection to a weird matrix message that was initially supposed to be on the single) and I Won't Share You. In the latter, there's another quote from the unused Morrissey sleeve note for the cancelled Crepuscule Ludus restrospective - the end of the note sounds very familiar: """"Oh Linder. Oh Linder. I'll see you sometime, somewhere."""" 

However, I'm not sure if you should mention any of this stuff in an article, for one thing it comes close to or falls directly into the realm of speculation on personal matters... then again, it's not like Wikipedia articles do not include speculation and rumours (Morrissey page is one of the examples!) But it would be wrong to make it seem as if she is more important for her relationships with male musicians than for her own work... so I don't know.

She was very worried how Johnny would react to the news of his dog's death. When Johnny returned from school, his mother said to him, """"I'm really sorry, Johnny, but Laddie died in an accident."""" Johnny responded """"Okay"""" and went upstairs to change his clothers. The mother was quite surprised at the calm reaction. After Johnny put on his play clothes, he went out to the backyard. All of a sudden, the mother heard Johnny screaming. She rushed out to the backyard and saw Johnny prostrate over the dog's body and wailing.

2466,"Tory ministers have saved an iconic gay bar once visited by Princess Diana

One of Britain's most famous gay bars which Princess Diana reportedly visited with Freddie Mercury was today given listed building status.

The iconic Royal Vauxhall Tavern, which featured in last year's hit film Pride about the 1984-5 Miners' Strike and where Lily Savage once started a riot, was given Grade II protection.

The 153-year-old pub - one of Britain's most famous gay bars and close to spy agency MI6's headquarters at Vauxhall Cross - has been at the centre of a planning row after being sold to property developers last year.

But the listing will make it much more difficult to close the bar and build flats - and is a victory for the RVT Future campaign.

Founder Amy Lamé said: ""The listing is a fantastic milestone for our community and a victory against the odds for our beloved pub.

""We look forward to continuing our work to ensure the RVT remains a vibrant space of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) community and culture for generations to come.""

The pub has a rich and colourful history.

Princess Diana was allegedly disguised as a male model and smuggled into the venue in the late 1980s.

Queen singer Freddie and comedians Cleo Rocos and Kenny Everett dressed Diana in an army jacket, cap and sunglasses for a night out at the south London pub.

Lily Savage once started a riot at the RVT when it was raided by cops in 1984.

And it featured in the smash hit movie Pride, which told the story of how a group of striking Welsh miners received the unusual backing of a group of lesbian and gay activists from London's emerging gay scene, with the pub acting as a backdrop.

The RVT's supporters include TV host Graham Norton and Lord of the Rings star Sir Ian McKellen.

Historic England's Director of Listing Roger Bowdler said: ""The Royal Vauxhall Tavern is an enduring and important venue for the LGB&T community.

""Built on the site of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, it carries on the tradition of alternative and bohemian entertainment which is bound up in this part of London's history and identity.""

Heritage Minister Tracey Crouch said: ""I am thrilled to be able to list the Royal Vauxhall Tavern as Grade II - the iconic cultural hub in the heart of London is of huge significance to the LGB&T community.

""Not only of architectural interest, the venue has a longstanding historic role as a symbol of tolerance and alternative entertainment.""

""Residing in Lambeth since 1860, the landmark venue has been the springboard for so many of our loved UK entertainers.

""I am delighted that the listing will preserve the history of this venue for future generations to enjoy. I hope that it continues to be filled with laughter and joy.""

2661,"Jennifer Aniston denies she had an affair with Matt LeBlanc

They had a steamy romance on screen.

But Jennifer Aniston has issued a denial, saying after the cameras stopped rolling, nothing ever happened between her and Friends co-star Matt LeBlanc.

Star magazine has reported that the father of the 48-year-old actor, Paul, alleged his son did have a romance with Jennifer, 46, while they starred on the show.

And the 73-year-old went on to say it is supposed to have happened while she was married to her former husband Brad Pitt.

Speaking from his home in Clearwater, Florida, Paul claimed: 'He even had a relationship with one of of the girls...Jen.

'They would make out in the dressing rooms. He told me about it - it was when she was married to Brad Pitt.'

A rep for Jennifer has strenuously denied the story, saying: I have commented in the National Enquirer and others. It's 100 percent false.

'Jennifer has never had a romantic or sexual relationship with Matt LeBlanc.'

The pair, who played Joey and Rachel on the global hit comedy, started a romance on screen at the end of season nine in May 2003 and the beginning of season 10.

Rachel starts to develop feelings for her friend who lives across the hall, and has dreams about him.

After Joey sees Charile (Aisha Wheeler) kiss Ross (David Schwimmer) he decides to go ahead with a relationship with Rachel, after she had confessed how she feels.

In season 10, which concluded in May 2004, the pair attempt to consummate their love, but fail and decide to remain friends.

Paul, who is estranged from his son, did not confirm at what point Matt and Jennifer are supposed to have got together in real life.

The Cake star was married to Brad, from 2000 to 2005.

Meanwhile Matt was with his ex wife Melissa McKnight - the pair tied the knot in 2003, after being together since 1997. They split in 2006.

Brad and Jen broke up after the 51-year-old actor made the movie Mr and Mrs Smith with his now wife Angelina Jolie.

The 40-year-old actress said in 2006 she met and fell in love with the Oceans Eleven star on the set of the movie, telling Vogue that they did not pursue anything romantically until he had announced his separation with Jennifer.

She said: 'It took until, really, the end of the shoot for us, I think, to realize that it might mean something more than we'd earlier allowed ourselves to believe.

'And both knowing that the reality of that was a big thing, something that was going to take a lot of serious consideration.'

LINDSAY Lohan wants to host a star-studded meeting with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to discuss the Syrian refugee crisis.

The actress wants to get the controversial world leaders together for talks – and she also wants to invite her Mean Girls co-star Rachel McAdams and former couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

Lindsay, 30, made the admission during a Facebook Live chat with DailyMail.com today, revealing she wants to meet divisive US President Trump as well as Russian leader Putin.

She hopes to draw attention to the problems facing Syrians who have fled the war-torn country – and she thinks a star-studded gathering will be the best solution.

Lindsay revealed she would also hope to invite Rachel, who she worked with on the 2004 teen comedy, and former couple Brad and Angelina.

She said of Trump: ""I want to try to get the word out to Donald Trump bring him over there [to the refugee camps in Turkey] have him see all the positive things they are doing over there and all America can do to help as well...

""[I want to meet him] to broaden his ideas of it because he hasn't been there and show America in the right light, helping the refugees...

""It is one world that we live in and we have to work together...

""I think it would be a positive thing for America to show their care and support...

""And for him to experience what it's like for these people.""

When asked who she was want to gather together for talks about the problems facing refugees, she added: ""Angelina Jolie... Donald Trump... Putin - the more strong figures we have [the better]

""Brad Pitt... maybe someone like Rachel McAdams - the more the merrier in this situation...""

Lindsay opened up about her plan Lindsay hopes to solve the refugee crisis

Lindsay recently jetted to Turkey to meet Syrian refugees at camps in the country, and she also met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

She also met with seven-year-old Syrian girl blogger Bana al-Abed at the country's presidential palace.

The actress later wrote on Instagram: ""What a dream it is for Mr. President Erdogan and The First Lady to invite me to their home. Their efforts in helping Syrian Refugees is truly inspiring.""

Lindsay visited Syrian refugees at a hospital in Istanbul in September, and the next month, she visited a camp in southeastern Turkey's Gaziantep province.

As far as we can tell, Botox tops the list of celebrity guilty pleasures: Everybody does it, but nobody talks about it. Except Nicole Kidman, that is.

The actress' seldom-moving face has been the subject of speculation the past few years, inspiring headlines like ""Help! I Can't Move My Face!"" Fortunately, Nicole's decided to address the rumors head on. And even though we've seen a bit of flip-flopping, her latest stance is that her visage is ""completely natural.""

""No surgery for me,"" Nicole tells Italy's La Repubblica. ""I did try Botox, unfortunately, but I got out of it and now I can finally move my face again.""

We don't know how recently this skin epiphany went into effect, but it's safe to say that her face stayed suspiciously still at the Golden Globes this month -- nary a frown line or a crow's foot. Also, back in May 2011, the 45-year-old maintained that she had ""nothing"" in her face, so was she glossing over the whole Botox thing?

This time around, she deemed the non-surgical treatment an ""unfortunate move"" and that she's moved on to more effective age-defying tricks. ""I wear sunscreen, I don't smoke and I take care of myself, and I am proud to say that,"" Nicole said.

Sunscreen as the fountain of youth? Well played, Nicole.

The 'Best Song Ever' star and Kendall were seen carrying their skiing and snowboarding gear together over the weekend.

One Direction's Harry Styles and reality star Kendall Jenner have sparked fresh speculation they are dating after being spotted on a skiing holiday break with friends.

The 'Story Of My Life' singer was pictured alongside Keeping Up With The Kardashians star Kendall late last week (2nd January) on a winter sports holiday out in Mammoth, California.

Harry opted to dress all in black for his day out alongside Kendall and friends, carrying his skis and poles alongside a pair of mirrored goggles.

Reality star Kendall kept her look a bit brighter with a purple  and white striped thermal outfit while carrying her snowboard under-arm.

Back in December Harry was pictured heading out to Kendall's hotel in London while in November the pair were linked to a dinner date out in California.

Earlier this week Harry was reported to be planning a more rock 'n' roll direction for the band's next album, following the release of third record 'Midnight Memories' in late 2013.

2855,"What’s Kanye West’s Next Move?

There’s something missing. Can you feel it? A slight twinge in the universe, quick and subtle, but a definite sign that something in the world just shifted. Ah, here’s what it is—Kanye West just deleted his Twitter and Instagram accounts.

The rapper apparently decided to abolish his social-media presence on Friday, waving good-bye to all those followers and likes and faves. Those tweets about Wiz Khalifa’s cool pants? Gone. That “###hashtag all positive vibes” tweet? Gone. Those “I’M SO LUCKY” tweets accompanied by nearly nude shots of his wife, Kim Kardashian West? Banished to the nothingness hinterlands of deleted posts. So too are all those random Insta photos of old Margiela lookbooks. For what it’s worth, West was never much of an Instagram power user anyway, deferring to his wife on that social platform (though he occasionally made strong post recommendations). His Twitter account, however, was practically an extended part of his brain, a home for stream-of-consciousness thoughts that caused as much controversy as they did delight. So why did he delete it? And what does it all mean right now?

Well, this isn’t the first time West has waved good-bye to his social-media platforms. Sometimes, it’s because the artist wants to garner a little bit of buzz for upcoming projects. Back in 2013, West deleted all of his tweets, leaving only one cryptic message up: “June Eighteen.” That ended up being the release date for his upcoming album Yeezus, which was famously inspired by a Corbusier lamp and was released without an album cover or promotional singles.

So what could it be this time around? West ended 2016 on a rough personal note, hospitalized for exhaustion and sleep deprivation. He later kicked up controversy by meeting with Donald Trump at Trump Tower shortly after his election, tweeting about it, and then deleting those tweets. West, as all his fans know, has serious political aspirations, announcing his presidential dreams at, of all West-ian locations, the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.

Nevertheless, West has been maintaining a low profile as of late and is probably putting his political dreams on the back burner for the moment. It’s more likely that he’s deleting his social accounts (1) to get attention, and/or (2) for an upcoming artistic project. The workaholic is constantly working on new music and new fashion for his Yeezy Season line and Adidas collection. On Friday, he and Kardashian West launched TheKidsSupply, a high-priced children’s clothing collection. He recently released a high-end collection of religious-inspired gold jewelry. “I wanted to create something that represented timeless love,” he recently told Vogue.

The only thing missing from his endless release cycle is . . . new music. Last year, shortly after releasing The Life of Pablo (a release cycle marked by controversial tweets), __West tweeted about a cryptic new music project titled Turbo Grafx 16, after the old gaming console. However, that project seems to have fallen to the wayside, as there have been new rumblings of a NASA-inspired project, though it was later debunked by fans. Still, it’s impossible to believe he’s not working on something new.

But maybe—just maybe—West is . . . merely enjoying being an incredibly rich celebrity? Taking a much-needed break from the public eye? The fashion-obsessed star recently skipped the Met Gala, an event he’s frequented numerous times over the year as the chief ambassador of #vibes and shredded jeans. Why did he skip it? He just wanted to stay home, according to his wife.

“He’s been taking some time off and really loving that,” she told André Leon Talley on the red carpet.

O.K., we’ll consider that story . . . for now. But don’t expect West to stay off social media for too long.

2613,"EXCLUSIVE PICS: First photos of Ariana Grande since Manchester attack

An emotional Ariana Grande was spotted for the first time since the terror attack at her Manchester concert on Monday as she touched down in her hometown of Boca Raton, Florida.

The pop star could be seen in tears as she exited a private jet on Tuesday afternoon and was greeted by her boyfriend Mac Miller, who was waiting on the tarmac to comfort the 23-year-old singer.

Ariana, who was dressed in head-to-toe black and carrying a purple unicorn onesie, shared a lengthy embrace and kiss with Miller before being whisked away in an SUV caravan to a family member's home in a nearby gated community.

Miller could also been seen warmly embracing Ariana's mother Joan, who like her daughter was dressed entirely in black, and giving her a kiss on the cheek as he helped her into one of the waiting vehicles.

Police cars were also seen surrounding Joan's nearby home, less than 24 hours after 22 people lost their lives and another 119 were injured when a improvised device went off inside Manchester Arena just moments after Ariana performed her final song.

Joan was one of the people in attendance when the bomb exploded on Monday and heading backstage to congratulate her daughter when the night suddenly described into chaos.

Rather than panic however, she immediately got to work helping some of the young concertgoers make their way out of the arena and safely backstage, where she stayed with the group and helped to calm them down amidst the mayhem.

Ariana has yet to speak publicly about the devastating attack, but did post a message on Twitter early Tuesday, writing: 'broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words.'

The pop star has also now indefinitely delayed her much-anticipated European tour, which kicked off in Stockholm on May 8 and was set to wrap up on June 15 in Rome.

She and Joan made a quick and quiet departure from England early Tuesday morning with a little help from fellow pop star Taylor Swift, who lent the two women one of her private jets. Sources told TMZ, however, that Swift wasn't involved in the process, as the private jet was financed down the middle by Grande's touring corporation Live Nation and manager Scooter Braun.

ISIS is now taking credit for the Monday night massacre, with authorities identifying 22-year-old Salman Abedi as the suicide bomber responsible for the carnage.

The blast from Abedi's improvised devise went off just seconds after Ariana finished her final song of the evening, with some of the injured victims telling authorities that the explosive appeared to be filled with nails and nuts.

Abedi is the British-born son of Libyan immigrants and lived just a few miles from the arena where Ariana performed on Monday.

Police are still investigating whether or not Abedi might have been aided by any accomplices in the attack, and at least one other man has been arrested by authorities in connection with the attack.

That individual, who is 23, has not yet been identified by police.

Investigators are spending a good deal of their time now pouring over the thousands of videos filmed on Monday by Ariana's young fans and the arena's surveillance footage for any clues as to how the attack was planned and who may have helped to carry it out.

Prime Minister Theresa May announced Tuesday evening that the threat level in the country had been raised to critical, meaning an attack could happen imminently in Britain.

If the incident is confirmed as a terrorist attack it would be the deadliest in Britain since four suicide bombers killed 52 London commuters on three subway trains and a bus in July 2005.

Manchester Arena said on its website that the blast struck outside the venue as concertgoers were leaving. Some eyewitnesses said it happened in the foyer of the arena just after the concert ended.

One witness said Grande had just finished her final song and said 'Thank you, Manchester,' before leaving the stage when suddenly there was a loud explosion.

The incident led to a nightlong search for loved ones as parents tried to locate their teenage children and groups of friends scattered by the explosion sought to find one another.

Taxi services offered to give stranded concertgoers rides home for free, and residents opened their homes to provide lodging for people who could not get home because public transport had shut down.

City officials said the true spirit of Manchester would shine through despite the horrendous incident  while Twitter and Facebook were filled with appeals for information about people who had not been accounted for.

The names of the victims are also slowly becoming public, revealing that most were young female teenagers, no doubt thrilled to be seeing Ariana perform live for the first time.

Eight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos is the youngest victim who has been identified at this time. Even more tragic is the fact that the young girl's mother Lisa still has no idea as she was left critically injured in the blast and is still fighting for her own life.

Saffie's older sister is also being treated for injuries she suffered during the attack.

Georgina Callander, 18, lost her life as well in the attack, just hours after the teenager tweeted at Ariana to let her know how excited she was to see her in concert.

Two years prior, Georgina had got to go backstage and meet Grande after her performance, and later shared one of the photos she took with the pop star.

Saffie and Georgina lived just two miles from one another in the village of Tarleton, and on Tuesday their friends, family, neighbors and even complete strangers gathered to remember the young girls, whose lives were cut tragically short.

Some carried balloons and others flowers while many had signs that read 'I LOVE MCR.'

With the whole of Britain in mourning over this tragedy, both political parties agreed to halt campaigning ahead of the upcoming June 6 election our of respect for the victims.

A number of celebrities also offered up their thoughts and prayers in the wake of Monday night's attack.

David Beckham, who became a global sports superstar while playing for Manchester United, posted on Facebook: 'Heartbreaking news from Manchester. As a father and a human what has happened truly saddens me. My thoughts are with all of those that have been affected by this tragedy...'

His Spice Girl-turned designer wife Victoria, who lived in Manchester after marrying Beckham, added: 'My heartfelt thoughts and prayers for all those effected by the tragedy in Manchester last night.'

Swift, who later offered up her private jet to Ariana, wrote: 'My thoughts, prayers and tears for all those affected by the Manchester tragedy tonight. I'm sending all my love.'

Katy Perry also commented on the violent attack, saying: 'Praying for everyone at @arianagrande's show... Broken hearted for the families tonight. Broken hearted for Ari. Broken hearted for the state of this world.'

And Rihanna wrote: 'Manchester has always been so close to my heart! These are innocent vulnerable kids, this could've been any of us! I'm devastated!

'Praying for the beautiful souls we lost, their families and loved ones, for the survivors who will forever be impacted by this #Manchester.'

One of the most poignant remembrances though may have come however from British-born talk show host James Corden, who was taping his late night program in Los Angeles when the attack occurred on Monday.

'It shocks me every time we hear this sort of news, that attacks like this can happen, but especially when there will be so many children at this concert tonight.

'Many of you won't have ever been to Manchester, but you will definitely have heard of it. It's famous all over the world for so many wonderful things, great football teams, Man City, Man United. It's famous for incredible music, Oasis and Joy Division.

'It was the birthplace of the leader of the suffragettes, it's the home of the inventor of the first computer. It's a place full of comedy, and curries, and character.

'But when I think of Manchester, the place that I know, I think of the spirit of the people there, and I'm telling you a more tight knit group of people you will be hard pressed to find.

'Strong, proud, caring people with community at its core, and if it was even possible, the spirit of the people of Manchester will grow even stronger this evening.

'My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Manchester tonight, all of the staff of the MEN arena, all of the security teams, all of the emergency services, Ariana and her team, and all of those families affected by tonight. We'll all go to bed, holding our little ones even tighter this evening.'

Thanks.  I nearly drowned when I was shoved overboard by some vindictive psychopath, but somehow I managed to swim back on board S.S Titanic.  Ironic really, given what I see coming up ahead.  Perhaps I should have saved myself the trouble, and just stayed in the icy water.

Your comments are interesting and may well be correct, however they don't really address the point I was making, regarding the gross, almost embarrassingly obvious, errors in the """"academic geek created/mindless computer driven"""" financial models currently used around the world.  The most similar """"theory"""" to the one I've pustulated above comes out of  this piece from """"The Prophet"""" Robert K. Landis, where he predictes a combined deflationary/stagflationary financial crisis.  Ludwig von Mises obviously had similar ideas, but no one has really done the """"hard"""" financial modelling on this Austrian School theory, and tried to collect long-term historical data, tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels (the frequency and severity of so-called """"black swan events"""") in financial markets.  My hypothesis is that with increasing margin lending and debt levels, you will see bifurcating bell curve returns (i.e. extremely high returns or extremely negative returns, with few data points in the range of the long term mean during these periods of heavy net indebtedness).

Landis comes close, but still no (Cuban) cigar.  Anyway, his piece is very topical right now, and made for interesting bedtime reading, tucked away here as I am in my tiny little third class cabin, far far away from the """"mad money"""" crowd.  """,0

Mel Gibson: Hollywood Pedophiles Have Nowhere Left To Hide

Mel Gibson says that the sexual abuse scandal in Hollywood is going to get worse, claiming that tinsel town pedophiles have “nowhere left to hide.”

Speaking at the Dublin premiere of his new film Daddy’s Home 2, the star was asked by Newstalk Breakfast’s Henry McKean about the current atmosphere in Hollywood.

Newstalk.com reports: Gibson said that he hopes there will be a positive outcome for victims of sexual harassment or assault who are now coming forward.

He said: “I think a lot of light’s being shined into a lot of dark places right now – and rightfully so.

“It’s tragic in a sense, because a lot of the poor victims have to relive it. [It’s] torturous for them – but they’ll get free by re-examining it.”

Gibson’s career stalled in 2006 when he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, and was recorded making anti-Semitic remarks following the arrest.

After a half-decade off screens, Gibson has made a gradual comeback in recent years – culminating in several Oscar nominations, including Best Film and Best Director, for his most recent directorial effort Hacksaw Ridge.

Talking about his own comeback, he simply said: “You just don’t stop breathing.”

2829,"It Appears Selena Gomez Just Adopted a New Puppy With The Weeknd

Less than a week ago, Selena Gomez and The Weeknd (a.k.a. Abel Tesfaye) were spotted playing with a pack of puppies at a NYC pet store—and now, it seems, Selena's brought one of them home. After all, the heart wants what it wants ( wink wink ).

In photos obtained by Elle , Selena's assistant Theresa Mingus was spotted on Thursday picking up the exact same Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy that Selena saw last weekend. Later, Theresa was seen delivering the pup to the ""Fetish"" singer's apartment. A fan account on Twitter also posted pictures from the store before Theresa picked up the puppy, in which a sign reading ""I'm going HOME soon!"" posted to the dog's kennel.

While many of Selena's fans expressed their excitement on social media for the newest addition to her family, others were disappointed because they're assuming she chose to purchase the dog from a pet store, many of which are notorious for selling puppies raised in unethical puppy mills , rather than adopting one from a shelter. ""Why buy instead of adopting this makes me so mad,"" one Twitter user wrote . In an Instagram comment screenshot by another Insta user, one person wrote , ""I also can't believe you would buy a puppy from the pet stores that are breeding and putting animals in glass and have them in bad living situations. Don't support stuff like that girl. Thought you knew better."" It has not been confirmed where the pet store Selena's puppy is from gets its animals, and Selena's team has not confirmed or denied any information about the animal at this time.

Fans are also wondering whether the dog belongs solely to Selena—who had rescued five shelter dogs as of 2010, according to People —or if Abelena are co-parenting the pooch. If it's the latter, they won't be alone: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner, who have been dating since December, adopted a husky puppy together just last weekend and have already set up an Instagram account for Porky Basquiat.

2471,"Does Madonna Want To Send Rebellious Rocco To Military School?

The reason why Madonna's son Rocco bolted for his father's home is becoming clearer. It seems that Madonna is a bit more strict at home than one would imagine, and she wants to send son Rocco to military school. Rocco Ritchie, 15, does not want to go, and while on tour with Madonna, he ran off to live with his father.

According to the Inquisitr, Madonna says that Guy Ritchie is trash-talking her to Rocco, but Rocco insists that his mother is controlling and uses him as a trophy. Also, rather than being in school in New York, he is dragged along on her tour and put to work. He has had enough and wants to live with his father. This is a struggle that many divorced parents face, but Madonna feels that she is above this and went right to a judge, but Rocco is refusing to come back to the U.S.

Radar Online is reporting that Madonna is taking her controlling manner to a new level by trying to get Rocco into military school.

""Madonna is a very good mother, but she's mega controlling,"" a source close to the pop icon, 57, told Radar. ""She actively tells him what he can and can't do, who he can and can't talk to.""

But Madonna thinks that military school will straighten Rocco out, but Rocco wants a normal life with Guy Ritchie in the U.K.

""He's not being dragged around like a dancing puppet [when he's in London],"" a source told the publication. ""He can meet his friends, eat fast food, he doesn't have an early curfew. The story is his father manipulated him, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Rocco has a life and friends [in the U.K.] and he can have girlfriends and be in one place.""

The judge had ruled that Rocco should be back by Christmas but is now insisting that he is back before school starts in January

The New York Daily News has mentioned that Madonna is a meddling mama, and Rocco is over it. A source says that life in London is easier for Rocco at this point in his life.

Madonna thinks she can provide a better life for Rocco, and that Guy Ritchie's life is boring.

""(Madonna) is impossible to work with and impossible to live with for a 15-year-old boy. He has no freedom under her. She tells him he's going away to school,"" says the source. ""His life (in London) is not strict, he's not Madonna's son, he's more like a regular teen. Guy lives a very normal life, Rocco is not on movie sets, if he doesn't want to be there.""

Rocco desperately wants to enroll in school in London and come back to New York in the future to visit. Over the weekend, Rocco was seen skateboarding around the Ritchie neighborhood and simply hanging out with friends.

There is no indication whether Rocco plans to return to New York for a hearing with the judge or if he will fight it from London with his father.

Do you think it would be best if Madonna would just give Rocco time with his father?

There are two important features of Smith's concept of the """"invisible hand"""". First, Smith was not advocating a social policy (that people should act in their own self interest), but rather was describing an observed economic reality (that people do act in their own interest). Second, Smith was not claiming that all self-interest has beneficial effects on the community. He did not argue that self-interest is always good; he merely argued against the view that self-interest is necessarily bad. It is worth noting that, upon his death, Smith left much of his personal wealth to charity.

1533,"""Kenneth Tennyson's reckless behavior in other forums==

As far as Kenneth Tennyson bashing other authors, here is an exerpt from a book review on Amazon.com:

Founder of the homemade Mushindo Karate movement, never studied under a legitimate teacher, or any martial art teacher, never set foot in Asia, completely disproven, shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. Of course he claims to have studied under masters in Tibet, and been a disciple of Okinawan Karate teachers - since disproven by such worthy sources as Gorge Mattson, et al. Was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back (""""Sleep with me and I'll enlighten you"""" kinda thing), uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex-students say at him, a propaganda liemaster. 

The person he is bashing is none other than Terrence Dukes (or the real Frank Dukes from the movie Bloodsport)

While putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:

Hmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you've trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let's see... I'm a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I've got to start learning about grappling though. 

Freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:

(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)
I see. However, you sounded like a racist.
No, I have no """"South Asian sensitivities"""". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. 

ALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of """"greatness"""". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?

Civilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.

You have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as """"obnoxious"""", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! 

(rocky - Asia Times Forum)
What inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?

Isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? 

That's just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.

I have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning.

It was no lonely day for The Weeknd.

The Grammy winner and his pop star girlfriend, Selena Gomez, spent Monday afternoon strolling the streets of Argentina hand in hand and enjoying some retail therapy.

In between steps, they paused to review photos on a phone as Gomez looked over her beau's shoulder.

No strangers to an international romance, the lovebirds have been traveling the world together in recent weeks, beginning in Florence with sightings in Venice, Amsterdam, Bogotá, São Paulo and now Buenos Aires.

Of course, the ""Starboy"" is currently on a world tour for his third studio album with an upcoming leg in Canada and the United States. But, before the duo need to return home for work, they've been enjoying their personal time together like any ordinary couple-holding hands and taking pictures with plenty of laughs and scenic sights. 

It's that kind of personal time that the songstress has made a priority as of late. 

""Right now, I'm actually enjoying finding moments for myself,"" she told Today's Sheinelle Jones.

""I like having a little mystery to where I'm at. I think that makes me feel very empowered, very in control of where I'm at.""

""I'm taking time to have a personal life,"" she continued. ""I'm doing things that I love that I'm passionate about, that I care about...it just makes me happy.""

“I drank five martinis and wound up naked in her closet, I’m dead serious,” Lawrence told the audience.

Kardashian said the “mother!” star asked the reality diva and her rapper husband Kanye West to dress her.

“You said, ‘I’m not joking, I really want Kanye to style me and so I said, ‘OK.’ I come back in and you’re fully butt naked,” Kardashian said.

After the two reminisced about the evening, Lawrence asked the mother of two if she had talked to O.J. Simpson since he was freed from prison.

Lawrence also asked if Kardashian thought it was a coincidence her ex-boyfriend Reggie Bush’s wife “looked like you.” The reality star laughed the question off.

Khloe Kardashian has formed such an intense bond with her niece Dream, she has told her brother Rob she wants to adopt her, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned.

“Khloe can’t get enough of that little girl,” an insider told Radar. “She’s so protective of her because of all the dramas surrounding her folks.”

Radar readers are well aware of the drama between Rob, 30, and on-again-off-again lover Blac Chyna, 29.

Rob even discussed the status of the relationship on the most recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

“I want to see [Dream] grow up,” he confessed. “I want to see her grow up and spend time with her every day…I want to keep my family together. I have been working at it for a very long time, but I’m just not sure anymore.”

Neither apparently are the rest his family, and that’s why Khloe has decided to step in, especially if there is a nasty custody battle brewing.

“She knows Rob getting full custody is unlikely,” the source said. “But regardless of what’s going on between Rob and Blac Chyna, she wants to help him co-parent his daughter – and get formal paperwork drawn up to make it real.”

Khloe seems readier than ever to settle down and start a family. As Radar reported, she’s shelling out big bucks planning a wedding with NBA hoopster Tristan Thompson, even though he hasn’t yet proposed.

“She’s set aside half a million bucks, which she figures will pay for at least half the ceremony as well as dresses, catering, entertainment and a five-star honeymoon,” said a source.

Khloe also been showering Thompson with all kinds of fancy and expensive gifts, including jewelry and luxury trips, to keep him from splitting, said one insider.

At 32, her biological clock is ticking away, making taking care of Dream her backup plan, the insider said.

“Khloe does want babies of her own one day, but she wants to be a significant part of Dream’s life,” the source claimed. “She’s totally in love with that little girl!”

I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth’s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better. I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little, otherwise the article might appear weighty. I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth))

But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: """"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who """"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth"""" but this was dismissed as """"speculative opinion"""" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle.  """,0

Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don't answer the questions beyond that
Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.  

First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.  

Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with """"probabilities"""". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say """"well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it"""". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.  

Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, """"B"""" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if """"A"""" were a dead body and """"B"""" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, """"A"""", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed """"B"""". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.

2475,"'Girl' Fight! Kanye West Confronts Anna Wintour Over Putting Lena Dunham On 'Vogue' Cover Instead Of Fiancée Kim Kardashian

Too big for your designed sneakers, Kanye? During a recent power lunch at the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge, the hip hop star demanded answers from Vogue Editor-In-Chief Anna Wintour to the question: Why did she judge Girls star Lena Dunham as being cover worthy for the famed fashion bible, while his fiance, Kim Kardashian, has long been overlooked?

Kanye, 36, insisted to the British-born fashion icon that Kim is ""just as talented as Lena, if not more so,"" one source revealed to Radar.

""Kanye thinks that Kim has a much bigger fan base and appeal than Lena,"" said the insider.

""To Kanye, it's insulting that his friend Anna is still refusing to even consider putting Kim on the cover of Vogue. He thinks Anna is listening to a bunch of 'know-nothing' corporate haters, as he put it. He's upset that Anna isn't willing to do him this personal favor and put Kim on the cover.

""Kanye knows that it's always been a huge dream of Kim's to be on the Vogue cover and Kanye wants to make it comes true. If nothing else, Kanye is persistent.""

PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Slammed The Kardashians

During an interview with Ryan Seacrest last year, Kanye declared: ""There is no way Kim Kardashian shouldn't be on the cover of Vogue. She is the most intriguing woman right now. She has got Barbara Walters calling her like everyday.""

The father-of-one may still has some work to do, however.

Last May, in a fashion slap heard around the world, Vogue editors cropped Kim out of its ""Best Dressed"" gallery when she appeared with West on the Met Ball red carpet in Manhattan, wearing the now infamous and universally panned floral print ensemble.

PHOTOS: Unforgettable In Paris: Kim Kardashian Busts Out With Kanye West

What's more, during Kanye's recent concert tour stop in Brooklyn, Wintour chose not to sit next to the E! starlet, despite being in the same VIP box.

""Anna is no fan of Kim or any reality star appearing in the pages of the magazine,"" one spy previously told Radar.

There is one consolation for the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star: Wintour is ""open to the idea"" of having Kardashian, 33, appear on the cover of the French or Italian edition of the magazine, a source confirmed.

""She hopes that will get Kanye off of her back,"" said the insider.

""There would still be some backlash if Anna allowed that to happen, but not as much if Kim were to appear on the U.S. edition.""

Jamie Foxx is reportedly teaching Katie Holmes' daughter Suri how to play the piano.

The 49-year-old star is thought to have dated Katie, 38, since 2013 and the couple went public with their romance earlier this month.

It has now been claimed that Foxx has been helping 11-year-old Suri - Katie's child with ex-husband Tom Cruise - master the keys and the pair are bonding over their mutual love of the instrument.

A source told the new issue of America's Star magazine: ""He's a great teacher and it's giving them a hobby to bond over. He makes the lessons fun and he's not pushy, which works for Suri. She loves to practice, and Katie couldn't be happier.""

Foxx - who has two daughters, 23-year-old model Corrine and eight-year-old Annalise - began learning the piano when he was just five years old and by the time he was a teenager he was a part-time pianist and choir leader in Terrell's New Hope Baptist Church in Texas.

He has carried his musical talents and passion through to his career, releasing five albums and collaborating with other artists, including rapper Kanye West on his 2005 smash hit 'Gold Digger'.

Foxx famously portrayed soul and jazz legend Ray Charles in the 2004 biopic 'Ray', and his portrayal of the singer-and-pianist earned him the Best Actor Oscar.

2712,"Sarah Jessica Parker Puts Rumors of Feud with Kim Cattrall to Rest with One Birthday Instagram

Although we couldn't help but wonder if Carrie Bradshaw would understand Instagram.

Yesterday was Kim Cattrall's 60th birthday. She received plenty of good tidings from various news outlets and other actors, but the main question on everybody's lips was whether her Sex and the City co-star would express her own well wishes. The answer was yes! Sarah Jessica Parker, the Carrie Bradshaw to Cattrall's Samantha Jones, took to Instagram to very publicly declare that she was sending Cattrall love and all her very best on this, Cattrall's special day.

""Your ol' pal, fellow mischief maker, and 'sister,' Sj,"" Parker signed her note. Sister didn't really need to go in quotes, but point made. For years, there have been rumors of a feud between the two co-stars on the set of both the Sex and the City TV show as well as the two films the TV show begat. This Instagram finally put those rumors to bed.

The cause of the fight is usually pinned to money. ""The ladies reportedly had a big falling out in the show's final season when Parker was paid considerably more than Cattrall on the HBO series,"" Us Weekly notes. Us reports that their alleged disagreement over money might have caused additional problems with production on the Sex and the City films.

Parker and Cattrall have denied rumors of a falling out and feud for years. In November 2009, Parker told Elle, ""I don't think anybody wants to believe that I love Kim. I adore her. I wouldn't have done the movie without her."" Cattrall, in turn, told the magazine, ""She shines and she allows you to shine as well.""

Cattrall was still being asked about the supposed beef in a January 2010 interview with the Daily Mail. ""I think Sarah was right: people don't want to believe that we get on. They have too much invested in the idea of two strong, successful women fighting with each other. It makes for juicy gossip and copy. The truth of us being friends and getting along and happily doing our jobs together is where near as newsworthy. I think Sarah is fantastic. . . . She and I are sick of this. It's exhausting talking about it, and a real bore.""

Well, it's been six years since that interview. Now we have social media, which allows us to get words and images straight from celebrities' mouths with no publication acting as a middle man to possibly filter or alter their quotes. So behold an image of Kim Cattrall posted by Sarah Jessica Parker on her birthday. Look at the caption in which Parker calls Cattrall a beauty and wishes her joy and an adventure-filled year.

It's just like Carrie said: ""Friendships never go out of style."" Or like Samantha said: ""I support you, and these bitches need to be put in their places.""

2532,"Allison Williams’ top-secret wedding revealed

Allison Williams is getting married on Saturday in a starry secret ceremony out west, Page Six can exclusively reveal.

The “Girls” star will wed CollegeHumor co-founder Ricky Van Veen in front of guests including her father, Brian Williams, plus Bruce Springsteen, Diane von Furstenberg and Barry Diller, and Williams’ “Girls” castmates Lena Dunham, Zosia Mamet and Jemima Kirke.

Also expected are Seth Meyers and his wife Alexi Ashe, Bee Shaffer, Andy Cohen, Tom Hanks — who may even officiate at the wedding, according to a source — and his wife Rita Wilson, who plays Williams’ mother on “Girls.”

The source told us, “The wedding is being kept so secret that guests are being asked to fly to Denver, where they will be picked up and taken to the location, which is thought to be somewhere in Wyoming.

“The accommodations for all guests are being paid for and then many of the guests are flying to LA together for Sunday’s Emmys.”

Williams, 27, who has been engaged to Van Veen, 34, since February 2014, delayed her wedding plans due to the scandal which engulfed her newsman father, which saw him stepping down as anchor of NBC’s “Nightly News” earlier this year after he exaggerated stories about his bravery in situations including the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina.

She said in February during a Q&A with “Late Night” host Meyers at the 92Y, “This has been a really hard time. Obviously [it’s] toughest on my dad, who is sort of bearing the full burden of the responsibility for it … Current events started happening so that derailed [wedding plans] a little bit.”

After a six-month suspension, Brian Williams is due to make his return to TV, this time on MSNBC, next Tuesday, where he will be a breaking news anchor and will initially report on the Pope’s visit. It is believed he delayed his return to TV until after his daughter’s hush-hush wedding.

A rep for Alison Williams didn’t immediately get back to us.

I'm not talking about belief of majority. In fact I would presume a billion Muslims specifically state he did not claim to be God and many of other faiths would agree.

You can object because it's unclear, but your statement """"he did not claim he was god"""" is merely your opinion. You really can't prove it. Considering the historical effect in least the concept he claimed to be god I think may make it relevant here, but I could see taking it off as disputed. Although if you want to get into it in many books I've read indicate Hong Xiuquan did not claim to be God either. He believed that Jesus was the Son of God, but not God.

2476,"Harry Styles Leaving One Direction Behind For Kendall Jenner?

In December, Harry Styles left his One Direction bandmates in Paris to meet Kendall Jenner for a romantic one-night rendezvous in London. At the time it seemed like a romantic gesture, but it may have been a foreboding sign of things to come. The two stars have been getting closer and closer, and the hot and heavy relationship is reportedly taking a serious toll on 1D.

Harry is starting to fall hard, and it's reportedly making him want to spend all of his time with Kendall instead of the band.

""Kendall's a sweet girl, but [the band] sees her as a bigger threat than Taylor Swift ever was,"" a source told OK! magazine. ""She seems to have cast a spell over Harry and it's disrupting other areas of his life because he's always wanting to spend time with her or chat with her on the phone when they're apart. It's causing a lot of unrest.""

Worse than Taylor - now that's saying something! But that assessment might actually be spot on - Kendall's reportedly causing so much tension within 1D that the boys' arguments are actually getting physical! ""The other day, Harry and Niall [Horan] almost came to blows when Niall confronted Harry when he showed up late for a meeting,"" the same source said. ""Things got out of hand before Zayn [Malik] stepped in to break them up.""

Guys! Don't you know it's supposed to be bros before hoes?!

Rumors about 1D splitting apart crop up almost on a daily basis, but this one seems to have more legs because Harry and Kendall really have been heating up. And it wouldn't be the first time that a sexy girlfriend got in between a band.

But hopefully claims of Kendall's negative influence on Harry and One Direction are overstated - and if not, we hope the guys of 1D will be able to work out whatever animosity has developed, and the lovestruck Harry can refocus on making music.

What do you think, HollywoodLifers? Is Kendall creating a rift in One Direction? Let us know!

Spaniards had killed thousands of jews and we saved you.French people burnt you down alive.Britons expelled all the jews.No need to talk about germans.Askenazis were living like animals under byzantine rule until we've come...I can give you a lot of examples...Yes there were 5 million jews in russia.What happened then? All of them were forced to live in """"Pale"""".Most of them slaughtered, orphaned and expelled.Most of the jews in US had flee from imperial russia.Yes, they really love you...

I have talked wit many foreign people.A russian girl told me: """"Ewww, do you like jews?"""" A greek told me: """"Don't you hate."""" An armenians told me: """"Kill all the jews who are decendants of devil""""...Only Arabs and Turks welcomed you but you're slaughtering arabs in palestine at the moment...

Don't misunderstand me.I am a realist.Most of the people on the world hates Turks also but we have a difference.We are the strong.Yeah some people loves Turks as well but they're minortiy and hatred of others reason is more jealousy...

Last but not least, i said that you couln't behave opposite against US in my last comment...

2488,"Robert Pattinson Recovering From Alleged Drinking Problem - Realized Substance Abuse Would Tank Career! | Celeb Dirty Laundry

According to recent reports and hints dropped by Hollywood sources, Robert Pattinson may have had a secret drinking problem that no one knew about. It would certainly explain why he's been hanging out with Zac Efron, of all people. We already know Zac isn't known for his sobriety, and Rob has been partying quite a lot lately.

Star Magazine's source claims, ""Rob had a hard time adjusting to fame and his breakup with Kristen [Stewart], and he turned to alcohol to numb it all. He drank a lot every night, and even during filming. But his health was suffering, and he realized his reputation for drinking could cost him plum roles.""

Is this so hard to believe? Daniel Radcliffe notably had a drinking problem as well, and that was without the public infamy that came with his girlfriend cheating on him in front of the whole world. Clearly, something about all these YA franchises is causing its actors to turn to alcohol, but with Rob's situation, he's always been a social drinker – maybe a little too much.

He's admitted to drinking before auditions, and he's usually photographed at bars or parties these days. Even if his vice isn't alcohol, plenty of people have said that Rob's had an issue with substance abuse, even if these allegations haven't technically been proven yet.

And trust me, they won't be. Rob's people are very loyal to him and very protective of him, and they won't go to the press with this. And if Star's source is right, then he's already realized that his health and appearance are more important, especially if he wants to continue acting. Alcohol doesn't do the best things to people's faces or bodies, and it's not like Rob has the acting skills to keep him employed without his looks. Sorry Twi-hards, but you know it's true.

Just my thoughts on itI doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone, and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail.

In some cases it is probably appropriate, and actually used just like a surname (in a legitimate but different, broader sense than that used by our surname article, and including patronymics in Iceland or elsewhere) by the person.  That's probably especially true of radio personalities with an on-air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name (I've seen that happen quite often), and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names.  But as a general rule, no. Some like Ann-Margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen. The problem, of course, is that our articles, especially the stubs and sub-stubs, often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on.  If it is """"Mary Lou""""  or something of the sort, common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname, especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself, it should clearly be under M in any category (the redirect which should be there, or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page, could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories, and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful).  But in between, there is a huge variety that you'll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done.

A bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories, and there are lots of them. Even worse are those Easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesn't even appear in the article's own name.  """,0

2470,"Liza Minelli Has 'Three Months Left' To Live After Tragic Relapse: Friends Tell All

Liza Minnelli's sad life has taken one tragic turn after another - and it's finally gotten the best of the beleaguered star!

The Academy Award–winning actress and singer has waged a desperate battle against drugs and booze her entire life, as well as a slew of devastating health problems. Now, RadarOnline.com has learned that her friends fear for her life.

Minnelli, who just turned 70, has suffered a shocking relapse and is back to her old habits, claimed a spy.

In September, she sold her luxe New York apartment, where she had resided for more than a decade. Minnelli is currently living in a rented Los Angeles home and is controlled by her assistants, claimed the insider.

PHOTOS: Hollywood's Addiction: 24 Stars Who Died From An Overdose

The latest drama comes after she recorded a bizarre message in which she seemed to be bidding farewell to close pals and adoring fans.

""I wouldn't be who I am without you, any of you, and on top of that, I just remember all of the goodness and all of the kind wishes and the support and the friendship,"" she said in the message, released shortly after her March 12 birthday.

Strangely, she concluded with, ""Thank you very, very much. I'll never ever forget you.""

""It was chilling listening to it,"" one longtime Hollywood insider told Radar after hearing the message. ""Liza sounded like she was saying farewell. It was just heartbreaking. People have to be worried. You just have to wonder if she has three months left.""

PHOTOS: What Happened Here? Celebrity Deaths That Remain A Mystery

As Radar previously reported last April, a killer combo of alcohol and prescription pills landed the Cabaret star in a Malibu rehab center. She has ""spiraled out of control"" after a painful new back injury, which she sought help for in her fifth rehab stint, dished a source.

While Minnelli's rep denies she's dying, her health woes have been numerous. She had two hip replacements, contracted double pneumonia in 2000, battled viral encephalitis a few months later, broke a kneecap in 2003, fractured her wrist in three places in a 2013 tumble and underwent back surgery the following year.

""Liza has been through so much,"" lamented the spy. ""You just have to wonder how much more she can take. People are worried about her. Right now, all we can do is pray.""

2738,"Rosie O'Donnell, Whoopi Goldberg swap weight-loss stories


(CNN) -- ""The View"" returned to TV on Monday with a new set, two new faces and a pair of returning hosts who've spent their time away focusing on their health.

During the season premiere, the revamped ""View"" cast, which now includes Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace, introduced themselves and caught the audience up on their lives.

For Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell, some of their big news included new physiques. Goldberg has shed 35 pounds, and O'Donnell, who previously co-hosted ""The View"" in 2006 and 2007, has lost more than 50 pounds.

""I'm good, I'm happy since you saw me last,"" O'Donnell told ""The View"" audience Monday. ""I got married, I have a new baby. ... I lost 50-something pounds with surgery because I had a heart attack two years ago. I had the vertical gastric sleeve -- if you're morbidly obese, it can save your life.""

When it was Goldberg's turn, she admitted that she, too, has ""lost a little weight.""

""I ended up weighing 217 pounds, which was way too much of me for anyone,"" Goldberg quipped.

Former ""View"" star Sherri Shepherd, who left the program in August, inspired Goldberg, 58, to get in better shape.

""I happened to notice that I had begun to look like a linebacker,"" Goldberg told ABC News backstage. ""I happened to look over and there was Sherri (Shepherd), skinny, and I said, 'What did you do?' She said, 'I've been doing Rocco DiSpirito's one pound a day diet.' I said, 'Please, I want to do it too.' ""

O'Donnell, who first shared her weight-loss success in April, told ABC News that the change hasn't been easy.

""The fact that I look so different has been difficult and unexpected,"" the 52-year-old said. ""Everyone assumes that obese people would just be jumping for joy that they were healthier and thinner and able to fit into store-bought sizes, we don't have to go to the plus store. But it's also filled with a lot of emotional turbulence, you wouldn't expect.""

About a year ago, the Spice Girls were celebrating the 20th anniversary of their single ""Wannabe."" The single, which, despite being the group's first, managed to hit the top of the charts in almost every country it was released, set the precedent for the quintet to be one of the biggest musical forces of their time — a destiny that was fulfilled tenfold.

To celebrate the monumental anniversary, three of the group's members—Mel B (Scary Spice), Geri Horner (Ginger Spice), and Emma Bunton (Baby Spice)—all climbed into bed together to record a special thank you video for the fans. Casually mentioning a ""special party"" that the fans ""are all invited"" to, the members also slyly hinted at an upcoming reunion.

Later, the members announced that they would be touring the following year, with a special concert slotted for London's historic Hyde Park. Though Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice) and Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice) have both assured the public that they had no plans to join the other three in the reunion, it seemed like the trio (which rebranded as GEM) was still determined to power forward.

Unfortunately, a pregnancy for Geri put the reunion plans on an indefinite hiatus — but even after the singer gave birth to her child in January, there was still no word on when the group would get the ball rolling again. Now, according to a report in Page Six, we have official confirmation that the reunion is back in the works thanks to Mel B's impending divorce from her soon-to-be ex-husband Stephen Belafonte. According to the report, Belafonte's ""controlling influence"" had always been an ""unnerving presence"" for the group. But now that he is out of the picture and Scary Spice is finally free, Ginger Spice confirms, ""We're not re-forming immediately, but in the near future.""

The 51-year-old new mom is sporting a sleek physique that her trainer says she accomplished without putting in massive hours of cardio, reportedly shedding 70 pounds.

""We were training a minimum of four times a week, and the sessions were never less than 45 minutes, no more than an hour,"" Sybliss said. ""Very intense though, very intense training.""

And while Jackson was intent on shedding her pregnancy pounds, Sybliss said she focused the training on adding lean muscle to her client to help her be in her best shape for the concert tour.

The trainer said they did back-to-back weight exercises rather than cardio to get Jackson's heart rate up and to help her burn fat. ""What that does -- you would look at her and think she'd done like an hour of cardio with me -- but when you're working with weights and you're working the muscle that way, it elevates the heart rate, but also it's creating that fat-burning effect, both during the session and also when she left me, and that was key,"" Sybliss said. As for diet, Sybliss said she believes moderation is the key, and she doesn't sweat her clients about cheating every now and then. ""If Janet feels that she needs to have a chocolate cake, go ahead and have a chocolate cake,"" Sybliss said. ""You're not eating it every day. You won't get fat overnight.""

I also think it is mere rubbish but I also think it is not completely rubbish. According to the southeast asian history, most of the ancient rulers of this region are Hindus, some rulers came from Persia (map covered Middle east, Greece, west India - Achaemenid Empire, Seleucid Empire, Parthian Empire and Sassanid Dynasty, please look at the size of the map their conquered). Kedah is a good example where the king from Persia came and eventually he built a kingdom.

In the old days, it was slavery society (no sultanate and no democracy yet), all Hindu rulers belong to higher class, common peoples and the natives belong to inferior slave class. The Hindus rulers came from India and Persia and they ruled most of the southeast asia, they called themselves high class peoples, the rest are merely slaves. Parameswara is a Hindu ruler, he is one of the descendants of the Hindu royal family that belong to higher class of Hinduism.

As for the Macedonian bloodline, this is also not completely rubbish. In the old days, the Persian empire was so big, they are so proud with king Alexander the Great. Also, they ruled some of the southeast asian lands such as the Angkor, Pasai, etc. Parameswara later married Pasai's princess and adopted Persian Shah and claimed as descendant of Alexander the Great, I don't think all this is completely rubbish.

Anyway, please correct me, I may be wrong too.

2730,"Justin Bieber Asks 'Taylor Swift What Up' in Pic With Kanye West

We're not sure what it means yet, but on Tuesday morning (Aug. 2) Justin Bieber elicited more than 85,000 comments in just under six hours for a snap of himself in round John Lennon-style sunglasses FaceTiming with none other than Kanye West. But it's the caption that has the Internet speculating: ""Taylor swift what up,"" Bieber wrote.

Watch Belieber Kanye West Dance to Justin Bieber's 'What Do You Mean?' at L.A. Show

So many layers. The photo, which also features their manager, Scooter Braun, is further proof that one-time ""Runaway Love"" collaborators Bieber and West are still pals. But it also brought to mind the terse, meme-y ""what's good?"" exchange between Nicki Minaj and Miley Cyrus at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards. It also posted just three months after Bieber shared an Insta of himself singing Swift's ""Teardrops on My Guitar."" And not for nothing, the caption to that one was ""TAYLOR SWIFT WHAT UP, HUH.""

As The Weeknd reconnects with his ex, Bella Hadid, Selena Gomez continues her string of appearances with Justin Bieber. Last night, she supported the Canadian pop star at his hockey game in LA (for the second time). And the two took the PDA to the next level: they were spotted kissing at the rink.

Though the two haven't personally confirmed the reports that they're back together, this marks the first time they've been seen kissing since they started hanging out again.

Gomez also had some company—she brought along the puppy she and The Weeknd got together. She carried around the pup, Charlie, and played with him in the rink as Bieber took the ice.

Selena just adopted the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel in September. She and her then-boyfriend, The Weeknd (AKA Abel Tesfaye) were spotted at a New York City pet store playing with the dog before taking him home. Since then, Charlie occasionally tagged along for the former couple's candid appearances. It looks like Selena got custody of the pet after she and Tesfaye broke up at the end of October.

In recent weeks, Gomez and Bieber have made numerous joint public appearances, which began even before it was announced that she split with the R&B star. One sighting also took place at one of Bieber's hockey games, which took place just two days after Gomez and Tesfaye's breakup was reported. During that appearance, Gomez cheered on Bieber from the stands, and later left with him while wearing his hockey jersey. There was also this cute PDA moment:

For last night's game, however, she drove home alone (except Charlie was also in the car).

Bieber and Gomez are reportedly back together, but despite the frequent joint appearances, sources say the couple is trying to take it slow. ""They just backed off a little from being out there and are being a bit more low-key,"" sources told People.



Whether or not The Weeknd is trying to rekindle is old romance with Bella Hadid, Gomez seems completely unbothered.

Kim kept things cool in an elevated take on the army surplus jacket, adding a touch of contrast to her all-black aesthetic. Yeezy 950 duck boots gave the ensemble an added utilitarian vibe and picked up on Kanye's lo-fi look; he was dressed in an oversize jacket, skinny jeans, and gray Yeezy 750 high-tops, complementing his wife's style. It was little North, though, who really put her best foot forward. The 2-year-old budding style maven has demonstrated her fashion acumen in the past with custom Fallon chokers and statement coats, and this latest look had tons of baby-grunge attitude: Note the faux fur topper, Thrasher tee, and leopard-print slip dress. Her black sneakers, on the other hand, were a kid-friendly alternative to Dr. Martens.

UPDATE: Halle Berry joked about the pregnancy rumors in an Instagram post on Monday, June 5. “Can a girl have some steak and fries??” she captioned a pic of herself.

ORIGINAL STORY: Halle Berry’s rep has denied that the Oscar winner is pregnant with her third child.

“It is absolutely not true. She is not pregnant,” the actress’ rep tells Us Weekly of rumors Berry is expecting again.

Berry, 50, first sparked pregnancy rumors when she attended the Butterfly Ball in L.A. on Sunday, June 4. The actress, in a form-fitting silver sequined dress and a jacket by Yeon, placed her hands on her stomach and appeared to be cradling a baby bump.

The Extant actress is already mom of daughter Nahla, 8, with ex Gabriel Aubry, and has 3-year-old son Maceo with ex-husband Olivier Martinez.

Berry filed for divorce from Martinez, 51, after two years of marriage in October 2015. They reportedly finalized their divorce in December 2016.

“Things were extremely bitter with them as the marriage went on and in the end,” a source told Us Weekly at the time. “Finally they both tried to file against each other. It was always like that, very heated and a lot of competition and battling between them. Two extreme tempers and people that love to fight.”

Berry opened up about motherhood in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar in April 2009. “Having a baby takes so much from you. It’s the most glorious thing you’ll ever do, but the aftermath is not so glorious!” she said, shortly after giving birth to Nahla. “I used to work a lot because I had nothing better to do. What I’ve learned, especially by having a baby, is that you can’t bring that stuff home anymore.”

1872,"CEREMONIES AT MINDROLLING MONASTERY 

Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar Month

The Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month.
This grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentient beings, particularly of the deceased. On the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year.

Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar Month

Beginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang Du Pa terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India.
The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lama dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public.

Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar Month

Since the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa.
On the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lama dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lama dances in Tibet in their original form. Many people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. On the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha.

Saga Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th Month

This Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony.

Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar Month

This auspicious ceremony marks the birth of the Guru Mahaguru Padmasambhava. This drubchen is performed for three days in accordance with the Lama Sangdu text from the 8th to the 10th day of the 5th lunar month. Suring the Drubhcen, secial feast practices are done and the Tsog ( feast offerings) is distributed to the general community.

Yarne, the Summer Retreat- 15th Day of 6th Lunar Month to 30th Day of the 7th Lunar Month

This is the rain retreat for one and a half months from the 15th day of the 6th lunar month to the 30th day of 7th lunar month. The retreat is held in accordance with the instructions of the Buddha in the Vinayana Sutra directingall monks to observe certain restrictions and engage themselves in meditation and practices for the period. Khenpos and Lopons give teachings each day and “So-Jong” or confessions are offered by the sangha during this retreat. Many butter lamps are offered and pujas are done during the retreat. On the evening of the 30th, the last day of the retreat, selected monks give teachings and expound the Dharma to the community. The retreat is usually followed by a 3-5 day holiday break for the monks.

2749,"Fifty Shades Darker news: Jamie Dornan reveals TRUTH behind Dakota Johnson 'awkwardness'

FIFTY SHADES DARKER star Jamie Dornan has revealed what his relationship with co-star Dakota Johnson is really like - admitting the first film was a little on the bumpy side.

However, the Northern Irish actor confirmed that they now have a ""bond"" that will ""always be there"".

He said: ""We've been through a very unique situation that probably neither of us will ever go through again, that pushed us together and we had to rely on each other 100 per cent. It forged that bond between us that will always be there.

""We didn't know each other particularly on the first one because I was late to the party, and it meant there wasn't a lot of time to form that friendship and that dynamic between us.

""But working on this and Fifty Shades Freed [the next film] was so much better in that sense because we had gotten to know each other so well, become best friends, knew what to expect of the other - especially when you're shooting scenes of very close intimacy.""

On the sex scenes, he added to Heat: ""It was easier to do the sex scenes with someone you know well. There were glimpses of awkwardness in the first, but that was completely eradicated by the second. 

""We both got to learn that each of us go for the joke when things get a little too intense, or bashful, it's our natural reaction.""

The movie has performed strongly at the box office despite swathes of negative reviews.

Dornan and Johnson also recently revealed that one particularly steamy sex sequence - set on a pool table - was cut.

The film has had an odd impact on cinemas around the world: in France last week, a man was arrested in France for masturbating in a screening.

In a remarkable coincidence, he had not realised he was sitting next to military police officers.",0

 Hu12 administrator apparent libel and abuse 
Report to a Chair:

Hello, this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for Mount Hood, done by administrator Hu12.  Toward the bottom at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mount_Hood#Climbing_Records  

The issue stems from, as you'll see in the article's history section, my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for Dan Howitt, with the press article references.

Hu12's post:
After going through the """"google results"""" (a disturbing education of sorts), there appears to be a long line of aliases for Dan Howitt, posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. Appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. It has been removed. I'd suggest that Dan Howitt  read the following, Wikipedia:Wikipedia is in the real world and Law Of Unintended ConsequencesHu12

My reply:
Please remove Hu12's Libel and Vandalism above and please report this user's abuse to Wikipedia administration. Also, Hu12 of the """"google results"""" you searched most are in support of Dan Howitt, with tons of his official summit photos on Rainier, Adams, Hood, Shasta, and listings of his timing officials. You strangely give weight to the abusive chat-site gossip and unsupported libel, and your own post above is of that nature. Chat-sites with this sort of conduct are sad. I'm reporting your libel and abuse to the wiki administration.Saffron1x (talk) 

Note Hu12 cites a link above as support for his allegations of Dan Howitt.  In reading the chat-site thread, and note it's a mere chat-site and has a lot of personal attacks, gossip, unfounded content, libel, etc, you will, nevertheless, find considerable support for Howitt including climbing record photos, timing officials names, etc.  Hu12 emphasizes the allegations about the use of aliases, and this is gossip and unsupported.""",0

Taylor Swift Releases Apparent Kanye West Diss Song
2017-08-24
Taylor Swift is not ready to make nice on ""Look What You Made Me Do,"" the biting lead single of her highly anticipated sixth album, Reputation. Jack Antonoff, who worked with Swift on her last album, 1989, co-wrote and co-produced the dance-pop song, which includes an interpolation of Right Said Fred's ""I'm Too Sexy.""

""I don't like your little games/ I don't like your tilted stage,"" Swift viciously sings. ""The role you made me play: of the fool/ No, I don't like you."" Later, she sings, ""The world moves on / Another day another drama, drama / But not for me, Not for me / All I think about is karma.""

Towards the end of the song, Swift uses an effect that approximates singing through a phone. ""The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now,"" she says. ""Why?/ 'Cause she's dead.""


While not mentioning Kanye West by name, the song's lyrics (West notably used a tilted stage on his recent Saint Pablo tour) alongside the phone voice appear to reference her long, public feud with the rapper. The beef was revived last year after West's song ""Famous"" included the lyric: ""I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/ Why? I made that bitch famous."" West's accompanying video feature Swift's likeness naked in bed with other naked celebrities. Swift denounced the song upon its release, taking issue with being called a ""bitch"" and West taking credit for her success. Months later, West's wife Kim Kardashian leaked video and audio of West and Swift's phone conversation, seemingly confirming that Swift was aware of some of West's lyrics about her in private. There was no recording, however, of Swift listening to and approving ""I made that bitch famous.""

 
Taylor Swift vs. Kanye West: A Beef History
From ""I'mma let you finish"" to ""Look What You Made Me Do,"" we recap pop's most high-profile feud
After the song's release, certain listeners questioned the timing of the album, as Swift's November 10th release date lands on the same day as the 10th anniversary of the death of Kanye West's mother Donda. A source at Big Machine Records, Swift's record label, however, denies any correlation to Rolling Stone. ""It is standard practice that releases come out on Fridays and we locked in this release date based on other Universal Music Group releases,"" the source says. ""There is no correlation.""

Prior to ""Famous,"" Swift and West made amends both publicly and privately following their initial rumble at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards where West hijacked the stage during Swift's acceptance speech for Best Female Video to say that Beyoncé should have won. The gaffe was so shocking, even President Barack Obama weighed in, calling West ""a jackass"" for interrupting the singer. Swift's Speak Now ballad ""Innocent"" is about that event. ""I think a lot of people expected me to write a song about [West],"" she told MTV at the time. ""But, for me, it was important to write a song to him.""

Reputation will be released on November 10th and is available for pre-order. Swift has partnered with Target to release two 72-page magazines alongside the album that will include ""personal poetry and photos, artwork by Taylor, handwritten lyrics, exclusive poster"" and photos from the ""Look What You Made Me Do"" video shoot. 


While the singer-songwriter has yet to reveal specific tour dates, she also announced a partnership with Ticketmaster Verified Fan, a new program that attempts to block scalpers and bots from obtaining tickets. The singer also released a video explaining the process.

Since wrapping her 1989 world tour at the end of 2015, Swift took on more background roles in music. She co-wrote Little Big Town's ""Better Man"" and Calvin Harris' ""This Is What You Came For,"" which features Rihanna on lead vocals. She also collaborated with Zayn Malik on the hit song ""I Don't Wanna Live Forever,"" from the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack.

And have ya ever wondered what it must be like for this anonymous woman to be carrying a child for two of the most famous people on the planet?

Well, Kim Kardashian stopped by The Real this week, and she revealed something surprising: Her surrogate had no idea whose baby she would be carrying at first.

""She didn't know at the beginning,"" Kim said. ""She didn't know.""


And Kim explained that she didn't actually HAVE to tell her, if she didn't want to: ""You could do it totally anonymously; you could go that route.""


But she ultimately decided to let her surrogate know who she was.
 

""I just felt like I wanted whoever's carrying my baby...like, what if they weren't a fan of me or my husband, and what if they didn't want to be carrying our baby? I wanted to give them that choice.""


""I wanted a relationship with her,"" Kim concluded.


Kim also told the story of how the woman reacted when she finally found out who had hired her, and it all sounds pretty perfect:
She was really excited. She was someone that had watched the show [Keeping Up With the Kardashians] — not like a superfan or anything. That it would've been uncomfortable — but she had seen my struggle and seen how open I was about it. So she was really proud to do it and really excited.
Uh, can you even imagine??? This woman's life must be WILD.
 

Kim also explained in the interview why she didn't invite the surrogate to her baby shower. (She has to explain to whole sitch to her kids first.) Overall, it sounds like Kim and her surrogate have a solid relationship.


Kim also revealed (accidentally) to Ellen this week that the baby will be a girl. Very excited for a million adorbs pics of her on Instagram!!!

Dear Wikipedia,

I am glad that you have included a section for opposition forums to the GMC to appear on your website. I had earlier thought of stopping my donations to Wikipedia over your failure to acknowledge the Abolish the GMC group - but will now continue to support your cause because I am now satisfied that your inclusion of them now shows you to be fair.

My neigbour lost her only child because of the incompetence of one of the current bosses of the General Medical Council , but the GMC covered up the case - so we couldnt get justice.

So please permanently protect the GMC opposition page from further attack by unscrupulous GMC agents  - as I have just had to re-paste it in honour of the poor wee child who was murdered by the wicked GMC boss.

Please do this in memory of him.

Thank you-

2431,"Justin Bieber pokes fun at himself after stepping out with an wet mark

Accidents happen, but this star is not sorry about it.

Justin Bieber happily made a joke at his own expense after stepping out with a big wet patch on his pants the day before.

The 23-year-old shared an Instagram of himself and Adam Sandler's character Billy Madison on Thursday to 'fess' up to peeing in his pants.

Just a few hours after pictures of the star surfaced of him with an unfortunate stain on his crotch area, Justin posted a picture of himself next to a screen grab from the movie Billy Madison.

Using a quote from a scene in the 1995 movie, Justin captioned the side-by-side image: 'You ain't cool unless you pee your pants.'

In the popular comedy, Adam's character - an adult man force to return to school to prove he can run his father's business - pretends to pee his pants so that one of his school friends does not get made fun of for actually peeing his pants.

The pee or not pee drama all started after the 24-year-old was seen in West Hollywood, California, with a giant wet patch on the front of his sweats.

The Sorry star's stain covered his entire crotch area and was rather visible in his almost $700 grey Vetements sweatpants.

The star ignored both the wet patch and a cameraman who constantly asked him about his ex Selena Gomez's new relationship with The Weeknd.

Justin made a beeline for his matte black Range Rover which he has had the badge changed on so it says Stealth Rover.

While in too much of a hurry to check his crotch area, Justin was not in too much of a hurry to grab a healthy juice.

Obviously unperturbed by walking around in wet pants, the platinum blond singer then headed to Earthbar.

There he fueled up on a green juice and walked along one of the area's busiest streets without a wet patch care in the world.

Aside from his stained designer sweatpants, Justin wore a white T-shirt with a distressed grey jean jacket and a pair of Nike Air Huarache.

As is his style these days, the Baby hitmaker added a pair of clear lens glasses.

Justin did ditch his stained pants later to head to church late that night.

It was fortunate he opted for jeans, as rumored on and off again love interest Kourtney Kardashian was also there.

There was also no missing Kourt with the 37-year-old wearing a sheer bra-flashing top to the religious service.

Kourtney and the much younger pop star have been linked since 2015 but neither have confirmed if they are romantic or just good friends.

2733,"AMAL CLOONEY IS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL WOMAN IN LONDON

You'd be forgiven for thinking the most powerful woman in London might be the Duchess of Cambridge, or even supermodel Kate Moss. In fact, it's George Clooney's new bride who has taken out the top spot.

Amal Clooney was named #4 in the Evening Standard's The 1000 Power List 2014 following British Prime Minister David Cameron, scientist Steven Hawkins and Prince Harry.  Other women crowned in the Top 20 were designer and UN Goodwill ambassador Victoria Beckham at #9, recent Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai at #12 and legendary performer Kate Bush at #16.

So what is it about Clooney that makes her so influential? She has recently become better known as the well dressed, beautiful 36 year old wife of Hollywood star George Clooney, but Amal has been making waves as a top Barrister specialising in international law for years and describes herself as 'lawyer, activist and author.'

The British Lebanese lawyer perhaps most famously defended Julian Assange, the founder of Wiki Leaks, in his fight against extradition in Sweden earlier this year. She also represented Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister of Ukraine before the European Court of Human Rights while the latter was detained under the rule of ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. Her credentials don't stop there, with Clooney having previously worked across numerous United Nations commissions, advising governments across international law.

Furthermore, in May 2014 she met with British Foreign Secretary William Hague to discuss international efforts to respond to sexual violence in conflict zones.

So sought after is Clooney, that she recently had to turn down an offer from the United Nations to be one of three people on an inquiry investigating war crimes in Gaza; stating that 'I am honoured... but given existing commitments - including eight ongoing cases - unfortunately I could not accept this role.'

So how did Clooney become such an internationally renowned lawyer? She studied Jurisprudence at St. Hugh's College, Oxford where she received an Exhibition scholarship and the Shrigley award, followed by a Master of Law degree at the prestigious New York University where she gained the Jack J. Katz Memorial Award for excellence in entertainment law. Since then she has lectured students on international criminal Law in London, New York and North Carolina.

Having recently returned home to London from a trip to Athens advising the Greek government, it seems Amal Clooney has taken the world, not just London, by storm, and rightly so.

2641,"Kathy Griffin Wants To Get Roasted On Comedy Central, Thinks It May Save Her Career

Kathy Griffin got into some hot water after she appeared to be holding Donald Trump’s severed head in a controversial photo shoot — but she has a plan to win back her audience! An insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that the comedian wants to be roasted on Comedy Central so she can put herself in a better spotlight. Will it work?


Kathy Griffin, 56, has a reputation of pushing the limits when it comes to comedy, but a lot of people felt like her recent stunt went too far. After posing for photographer Tyler Shields, 35, where she held a bloody Donald Trump head, the public expressed some massive outrage and hardcore backlash — she even got fired from CNN’s annual NYE special. So is her reputation officially destroyed? Maybe not.



Kathy wants to be the next celebrity roasted on Comedy Central. “Kathy knows that she has to combat the recent turmoil she is in with comedy and she wants to face things head on and she wants to be the next person to get roasted,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Kathy thinks this could help save her reputation since she is always lightened up when people tease her. “She wants to show she can take a joke and thinks it will humanize her and make her look better to those she has angered,” our source adds. “She would love to be the next person that Comedy Central considers.”

Comedy Central has roasted a good amount of celebrities, including Justin Bieber, 23, Rob Lowe, 53, and James Franco, 39. Odds are likely that if Kathy does become the next person to get roasted, then the Trump pic will be one of the biggest moments that comes up. And, perhaps, some other celebs will mock her in a way that makes her look better than she does now. But it might be hard to find someone willing to participate in the roast since a lot of celebrities have expressed their disappointment in her, including Debra Messing, 48, Jeffrey Wright, 51, Don Cheadle, 52, and of course, the president, himself.


Kathy took to her Instagram page on May 30 to post an apology video for the photo. “I sincerely apologize. I’m just now seeing the reaction of these images. I’m a comic, I crossed the line and I went way too far,” she said. “The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn’t funny, I get it. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career I will continue. I’ve asked your forgiveness. Taking down the image, gonna ask the photographer to take down the image and I beg for your forgiveness. I went too far, I made a mistake and I was wrong.”

HollywoodLifers, do you think roasting Kathy on Comedy Central could save her career?

 UFC AFDs 
Those were never transcluded to the AfD page so there's probably not a lot of point them existing.  I'm a bit pushed for time today, so if you want to remove the AfD banners from the articles, I'll delete the AfD pages when I get the chance.   
I haven't been able to spend much time on Wikipedia lately.  Looks like they've been """"officially"""" listed as AfDs.  I'll leave them alone for now.    

 Jake Bostwick 
I've only nominated a few, very obvious MMA people before.  Bostwick was deleted via AfD discussion.  A speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied.  To me, he still fails WP:MMANOT, but I'm in no way a MMA expert.  What do you think?   
At first glance it appears that Bostwick hasn't fought at the """"highest level"""" of MMA as required by WP:ATHLETE (or whatever the guideline is these days) and WP:MMANOT.  If I had an interest in having the article removed, I would AfD it again.    

Hello, It has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion. Can I first point out that Jake Bostwick is a former UCMMA middleweight champion and currently the UCMMA welterweight champion? UCMMA is, along with BAMMA and Cage Warriors, the biggest MMA promotion in the United Kingdom. 

Secondly, after glancing over WP:MMANOT and WP:ATHLETE, I see that they are indeed guidelines. Now I may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me, a guideline is optional when it comes to following it, meaning that they cannot be used in AfDs as the sole reason why to delete any article. 

Thirdly, I have spent much time working on the page (as well as being the creator of the page), I have found very strong sources from websites such as The Sun, The Mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a 'typical' mixed martial artist's Wikipedia page, as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called Party Wars, and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a Wheel Clamper only strengthens his notability. The very sources on him alone helps him pass WP:GNG, which is all you need to pass a page on Wikipedia in my opinion.

I would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more, but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion I find is a bit disrespectful towards me, however I fairness to you we haven't exactly known each other for a while, so now I have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the page's position on Wikipedia, now we can talk to help improve the page even more.

2432,"Did Angelina Jolie Fake Maddox Jolie Pitt's Adoption? Inside The Shocking Claims

Angelina Jolie is famous for adopting kids from around the world, but did she obtain her first son, Maddox, using falsified documents? Maddox's real Cambodian father has come forward with the shocking claims that Jolie doesn't have legal power of attorney over the 15-year-old.

According to Celebrity Dirty Laundry, Mounh Sarath says that he has official paperwork from Cambodia that confirms he is Maddox's father. Jolie started Maddox's adoption back in 2002, and Brad Pitt legally adopted him in 2006. But according to Sarath, he actually has power of attorney over the teenager.

Sarath and Jolie have not spoken to each other in years. Even more scandalous, the adoption agent Jolie worked with, Lauryn Galindo, was jailed for falsifying names, birth places, and dates of children from Cambodia. At the time Jolie adopted Maddox, the United States had just set forth stricter adoption laws for children from Cambodia. Did she rush the process to bypass the stricter laws?

The Sun reports that Sarath works in charity and local aid in Cambodia. Given his falling out with Jolie and the circumstances surrounding Maddox's adoption, Sarath's opinion of the Tomb Raider star is pretty low.

""I would be happy if Cambodia didn't see her again,"" he added.

Jolie's interest in Cambodia started when she filmed her 2001 hit film in the country, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. She recently directed a movie based in Cambodia, First They Killed My Father, and has visited the country on several different occasions.

The allegations against Angelina Jolie couldn't have come at a worse time. The actress is currently engaged in a heated custody battle with her ex-husband and just returned from promoting her newest film in Cambodia.

Maddox was also the source of a lot of controversy in Jolie's split with Pitt. Shortly after filing for divorce, reports surfaced that Pitt had physically abused Maddox on a private plane. Pitt was eventually cleared of all the accusations, but not before his public image took a major hit.

Things between Maddox and Jolie, meanwhile, couldn't be better. Hollywood Life reports that Jolie took Maddox and his five siblings on a week-long trip to London. During their stay, Jolie and Maddox ventured off to Buckingham Palace for a mother-son date.

The pair was spotted leaving the royal palace and looked happier than ever spending time together. It isn't clear if they actually met any members of the royal family, but there's a possibility they mingled with Prince William.

The outing came after Jolie gave a speech at the London School of Economics. Jolie spoke to a crowd of students about her career promoting human rights around the globe. The actress, who has been an avid human rights activist over the years, also spoke at the United Nations in London.

Maddox was the only member of the Jolie-Pitt family that accompanied Jolie to the palace. Earlier last week, Jolie was spotted taking Maddox's siblings out to a toy store in London. The kids have since returned to the United States.

As far as Jolie and Pitt are concerned, insiders claim that the drama is starting to cool down. Although they haven't finalized the divorce, a source revealed that they are at a better place in their breakup and are on the verge of working things out.

Given how their divorce played out in the early months, it's definitely good to hear that Jolie and Pitt are working through their differences. They have not released an official comment on Maddox's adoption.

Tell us! Do you think Angelina Jolie could have actually faked the documents to adopt Maddox? Let us know in the comments below.

2883,"Robert Pattinson: ‘Good Time’ ‘Helped Me Become a Better Actor’

Robert Pattinson is earning rave reviews for his intense and electrifying performance in A24’s crime thriller, “Good Time.” Under the helm of directors and brothers Josh and Benny Safdie, the “Twilight” star hides his dashing good looks to portray a grimy, bleached blond, goatee-sporting, crook from Queens, New York, who embarks on a mission to bail his mentally impaired brother (played by co-director Benny) out of prison after a failed robbery attempt. While taking on the demanding role, Pattinson said the experience has helped him mature into a commanding actor.

“I think I’m more confident now; this was a challenging role and I learned a lot about my abilities as an actor,” Pattinson told Variety at the film’s New York premiere on Tuesday evening, held at the School of Visual Arts Theatre. “Every single time I get to do another movie, I get a little more confident. You always want to grow in some way and challenge yourself. I feel like this one has helped me become a better actor.”

Critics have no doubt that Pattinson has developed into a masterful dramatic actor. He and the “Good Time” creators received a rousing six-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival last May where the movie first screened for an audience. The picture — out in theaters on Friday — currently holds a 94% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Robert Pattinson on Shedding His Movie Star Looks for Cannes Drama ‘Good Time’

“The writing in this — the dialogue felt so real and different,” explained the 31-year-old British star on the red carpet. “It’s set in New York and I’ve been here in New York a million times, but it just felt alien to me. There was something different and original about the characters and the story. I immediately knew the world of the performance that I wanted to do and I knew the energy I wanted when I saw Josh and Benny’s work. This was special.”

Now that Pattinson has received acclaim for his work in indie films and broken any preconceptions about his acting abilities, would he consider taking on another role in a tentpole franchise series like “Twilight” or stick to art house films?

“I look across the board every day,” he said emphatically. “The only thing I do is read script after script waiting for something to hit me. I like stories that feel authentic and it’s just difficult to find. There are a lot of scripts that feel like the writer read a newspaper article and then tried to use their knowledge from film schools to adapt it. That doesn’t interest me. Once I find something and feel really obsessed with it, I feel like I can really connect with the character and bring them to life.”

After the screening, Pattinson joined the film’s directors, producers, co-star Barkhad Abdi (“Captain Phillips”), and composer Daniel Lopatin at the Flash Factory nightclub for the after-party. Guests enjoyed celebratory drinks and White Castle burgers, which are featured in the film. Demi Moore, Chloe Sevigny, and Peter Sarsgaard were among the guests that joined in the festivities.

Kim Kardashian is green with envy over her sister’s bangin’ bikini bod. But instead of letting Kourtney Kardashian steal her shine, the OG sex symbol is going  on the attack. Here’s her EXCLUSIVE game plan to take back the spotlight!

With Kim Kardashian West‘s killer curves, you’d think she’d have all the body confidence in the world. But a friend of the reality beauty tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY, that Kim, 36, totally envies her sister Kourtney Kardashian‘s super fit physique. “Kim’s extremely jealous of Kourtney’s bikini body, don’t get me wrong she’s proud of her, but she still can’t help feel like she’s losing some sort of competition.” In fairness, the 38-year-old mom of three is pretty much killing the bikini body game right now — who wouldn’t be jealous?

“She and Kourtney have always been this way,” says our source.”When they were kids they would compete over every little thing and not much has changed.” Ah good old fashioned sibling rivalry — does it ever go away?

But, this is more than just a family power struggle, guys. According to Kim’s longtime friend she’s still feeling the aftershocks of the brutal body shaming she endured last month. “Kim is still struggling with what happened on their girls trip, the body shaming she got was horrific and she still hasn’t totally recovered.” Poor Kim, we know that must have been so hard.

Fortunately, Kim has found a way to take charge and she’s working out her feelings in the gym.”She’s trying to use this as motivation. She’s back training hard with Gunnar and she’s still workout of with Don too. She’s very motivated, she wants to get in better shape than Kourtney.” We think Kim looks absolutely amazing exactly as she is — they’re both body goals as far as we’re concerned!

2880,"Kendall and Kylie spent Father's Day with Caitlyn, but Kris Jenner is still furious with her ex

Have the Kardashian-Jenners decided to forgive Caitlyn for her tell-all memoir? Um... some have.

Kendall and Kylie Jenner posed alongside Caitlyn at an event on Father's Day, but if their social media is any indication, the girls weren't particularly keen on celebrating the holiday. Meanwhile, mom Kris Jenner created a photo college of all the special dads in her life: Kanye, Rob, Scott and the late Robert Sr. Notice anyone missing?

Caitlyn and her daughters posed for a photo together at the Rodeo Drive Concours d' Elegance in Beverly Hills on Sunday, and they looked like a happy family, pet dog and all. (By the way, whose dog is this? Kendall only held her for one photo.) But social media told a different story.

Despite the serene-looking professional photo, there's clearly still some animosity within the family. Neither Kendall nor Kylie acknowledged Caitlyn on social media, even though they were both actively posting: Kylie shared a pic of herself and Kendall, but Caitlyn is nowhere to be seen. Later, she posted another photo from the event, captioning it ""daddy's day"" -- but again, no Caitlyn. Kendall also shared a photo on Father's Day, but it had nothing to do with the holiday.

For her part, Caitlyn did share a version of the above photo, writing, ""Good day at the Father's Day car show on Rodeo Drive with my girls. Happy Father's Day to all the dads out there.""

Meanwhile, mom Kris Jenner made a strong statement with her very telling Instagram collage. The Kardashian matriarch wrote a lengthy caption celebrating all the dads, but there's not even the slightest nod to Bruce or Caitlyn. Kendall and Kylie are not in the collage, but all her other children and grandchildren are.

Plenty of fans called out the snub, writing comments like ""Where's Caitlyn??"" and ""The sun may be out, but there's plenty of shade here.""

Just another day in the Kardashian-Jenner world.

Justin Bieber carries a bible while donning preppy tennis clothes

He's not exactly known for being the kind of guy you'd take home to mom and dad.

But Justin Bieber seemed like the boy-next-door on Friday, donning a preppy look while out in LA.

The 23-year-old singer looked ready to meet the family, wearing head-to-toe white while also carrying what looked like a Bible in his hand.

The Cold Water singer looked to be in good spirits, joined by a friend during his afternoon outing.

Walking through the parking lot in white Yeezys, the smiley singer carried a copy of a what looked like a Bible as well as a slim laptop.

As he chatted with his friend, Justin's many tattoos were on display in the Adidas ensemble.

Not visible, however, was his newest ink - a large lion head on his left pec.

The 'lion-hearted' artist took to Instagram last week to reflect on how much he's grown since his last arrest in 2014 and to thank God for blessing the Love Yourself singer.

Posting a split shot of his current self and his January 2014 mug shot, Justin looked back at the progress he's made over the past few years, having remained arrest-free since August of 2014.

'I LOVE THIS because it reminds me IM NOT EXACTLY WHERE I WANT TO BE BUT THANK GOD IM NOT WHERE I USED TO BE!!' he wrote, adding, 'THE BEST IS YET TO COME DO YOU BELIEVE IT?'

The Baby singer was taken into custody on January 23, 2014 after officials said they saw the singer drag racing in a yellow Lamborghini with a friend.

He later was charged with resisting arrest and DUI after failing a field sobriety test and then cursing out authorities attempting to take him into custody, according to police.

Bieber eventually worked out a plea deal with prosecutors in the case, as he pleaded guilty to careless driving and resisting arrest, paying a $500 fine, completing anger management and drunken driving programs; and making a donation of $50,000 to the local charity Our Kids prior to the agreement.

""""That sentence assumed that there was wrongdoing. The rest of that section still implies it by the juxtaposition of the funding information with the report details. You may think that this is obvious, but we need a source that explicitly states that the findings of the the UT report were influenced by the funding received.""""Perhaps personal correspondence with the authors of the Texas study admitting their findings were indeed swayed by the knowledge that the business interests of major donors to their institution and research programmes would likely be substantially affected in the negative if said findings did not produce a clean bill of health for fracking? I mean, that's about the only way you could ever meet your demand. What an utterly absurd request. It's easy to see why it was made, though: just set the bar so high it can't be jumped, then use the failure as an excuse to chop out what you don't like. Maybe you'd have me hack the e-mail accounts of the authors, fish around for evidence (assuming there is even any there), then leak it to a major newspaper so they can write an article that I can cite on here. Only the most naive idiot can fail see the potential for conflict of interest from a study put out by Texas. The university's state is the heart and soul of US oil & gas, but that's certainly not worthy of so much as a mention given that which is also true: the university has multi-million-dollar and other links with the largest provider of fracking services in the United States, not to mention other oil & gas companies with interests in fracking. I have no idea whether their report was swayed by industry links, but only a fool would suggest the potential isn't there. If you don't like the juxtaposition, just open up a gap with a caveat—and make it as weak, pathetic and denigrating as you like for all I care, maybe something like, """"socialist—nay, communist!—campaigners in the pay of a European Maoist group have alleged a potential for a conflict of interest, noting that..."""" For comparison, take the recent global-warming sceptics at the Heartland Institute: as soon as details of the Institute's funding were leaked, they were prominently reported in the press. We don't even need leaks here, the information is freely available to anyone who takes the time to find it out, as Smm201`0 and others have done. All you are interested in doing is eliminating even mention of perfectly obvious potential for conflict of interest. According to Ian Urbina, we can't even get a decent, untarnished report out of the EPA; unlike Texas, the EPA doesn't even take industry funding, for god's sake, yet still it can't escape heavy industry pressure to redact. Aside from irrelevances like minor earthquakes, I have no idea whether fracking is causing all the problems it is alleged to, though I am extremely suspicious given the documented efforts of industry (and their paid-for puppets in government) to tone down or eliminate negative findings, and the truly just ridiculous claims about fracking's potential by people like Lord Browne here in England. And I couldn't care less if fracking's safe or not. Why should I? or anyone? If it's not, it's not; if it is... it is! Outside of a lunatic asylum, who would care? If it is safe (enough), bring it on: jobs, tax receipts, increased energy security, reduced use of coal burning... only a fool wouldn't be interested in those things, particularly given the current economic situation. What I don't like are those desperate only to hear what they want to hear making up totally unreasonable tests so they can get rid of what they regard as offending material.~   00:59, 28""",0

A BLIND ITEM was put out on July 27 on the website CrazyDaysAndNights.com saying the following:

July 27, 2016

This A+ list singer with the A+ list husband said she wouldn't perform at an upcoming television show if this other A+ list singer was present. No problem. The network didn't want the headache anyway.

2601,"Pop insiders claim Justin Bieber cancelled long-running tour as he's considering starting his own church

POP insiders sensationally claim Justin Bieber may have cancelled his current long-running tour so he can start up his own CHURCH. Bieber shocked millions of fans yesterday when he revealed he was calling off the Purpose tour months before it was due to end as he was ""burned out."" The Canadian has revealed he wants to get back to his religious roots

He wrote on Facebook that he was was feeling exhausted after 18 long months on the road. However, sources claim Bieber may now be looking at starting up his own church as part of his plan to get closer to God.

""[He’s] very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he’s looking at teaming up with them in something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own – starting his own church – we’re not quite sure, but that’s the word from an inside source.”

A statement on the star's Facebook site read: “Due to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts.

One wrote: "" I'm sad, but i understand. I wish nothing but the best for Justin Bieber and hope all is well. I will be at his next tour and will keep him in prayer.""

While another posted: ""I hope you're okay Justin xxx Your health and wellbeing is more important than the tour.

""We beliebers support you no matter what. None of us care so much about the tour at the moment ...we care about you and your team. Well done for all the hard work you and the rest of the crew did over the past 18 months Love you xxx""

Over the last two years, Bieber has admitted he had turned to God as way of getting his life back on the straight and narrow.

In a media interview, the Canadian said that God had come to him when he was lost.

He believed that ""the almighty"" was telling him something.

That was when he decided to change his life for the better and in his own words, ""get his stuff together.""

And just last month, he took a leap of faith off a cliff in New Zealand, symbolically marking a new chapter in his journey with Christ.

Bieber said the name of ""Jesus"" before launching himself off a cliff at New Zealand's famous Shotover Canyon Swing & Canyon Fox nature reserve.

He fell backwards with closed eyes and hands behind his head.

The video of his fall has reached millions of people. He captioned it #airbaptism and #gracefall.

Bieber was raised in a Christian home but fame and millions of dollars at an early age eroded his relationship with God.

He claims all of that changed when he rededicated his life to Christ and got rebaptised in 2017.

Now he uses his music to express his newfound faith, including singing worship songs at his concerts, and posting pictures of him at church on social media.

BAD BOY From drink-drive arrests to egging houses, Bieber's most outrageous antics Justin Bieber was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs. The star had been drag racing a yellow Lamborghini on a Miami beach street with R&B singer Khalil, who had been driving a red Ferrari. Charges were later dropped in an agreement which required Bieber to, among other things, go to anger management counselling and make a large donation to the “Our Kids” organization. Hours after his lawyer filed a not guilty plea to his drunk-driving charge, Justin Bieber was then charged with assault for allegedly hitting a limousine driver repeatedly in the back of the head. The alleged assault occurred when the driver collected six people from a Toronto nightclub on 29 December 2013. However criminal charges against Bieber were late withdrawn. Pilots of a private jet taking Justin Bieber and his entourage to the Super Bowl were forced to wear oxygen masks to protect against inhaling marijuana fumes which were filling the plane. NBC news reported that the captain of the plane was so concerned about the abusive behaviour of Bieber and his father towards a flight attendant that he had to move her away from them. Probably the most famous incident, Bieber was sentenced to two years’ probation and five days community service for egging the house of his neighbour, sports-agent Jeff Schwartz. As well as community service Bieber was also ordered to pay almost $90,000 in damages to his neighbour and undergo anger management counselling. Bieber stormed off stage mid-performance in Manchester after demanding that the crowd stop screaming in between his songs. However the singer did later return to finish his set. The pop star is filmed apparently punching a fan in Barcelona. The fan leaned into Bieber’s moving vehicle to touch him and footage shows Bieber seemingly responding by punching the fan in the face

2467,"Former Beatle Ringo Starr Claims the ""Real"" Paul McCartney Died in 1966 and Was Replaced by Look-Alike

Beverly Hills| The former drummer of the Beatles, Ringo Starr, surprised the world this morning during an interview in his luxurious Californian residence, when he admitted that the 45-year old rumors about the alleged death of Paul McCartney in 1966 were actually true.

In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Mr. Starr explained that the ""real"" Paul McCartney had died in a car crash on November 9 1966, after an argument during a Beatles' recording session. To spare the public from grief, the Beatles replaced him with a man named William Shears Campbell, who was the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest and who happened to have the same kind of jovial personality as Paul.

""When Paul died, we all panicked!"" claims Ringo, obviously very emotional. ""We didn't know what to do, and Brian Epstein, our manager, suggested that we hire Billy Shears as a temporary solution. It was supposed to last only a week or two, but time went by and nobody seemed to notice, so we kept playing along. Billy turned out to be a pretty good musician and he was able to perform almost better than Paul. The only problem was that he couldn't get along with John, at all.""

William Shears Campbell, better known as Billy Shears, does indeed ""disappear "" from records in 1966 and no traces of him can be found after Paul's alleged death.

Mr. Starr alleges that the group did send out a lot of hidden messages through the years to prepare the population for the truth.

He notably says that the entire Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album was awash with Paul-is-dead clues: the Beatles had indeed officially formed a ""new"" band featuring a ""fictional"" member named Billy Shears, which happened to be the actual name of Paul's replacement.

""We felt guilty about the deception"" added Ringo Starr. ""We wanted to tell the world the truth, but we were afraid of the reactions it would provoke. We thought the whole planet was going to hate us for all the lies we had told, so we kept lying but sending subtle clues to relieve our cousciousness. When the first rumors finally began about the whole thing, we felt very nervous and started fighting a lot with each other. At some point, it was too much for John and he decided to leave the band.""

Ringo Starr claims that he finally decided to tell the truth, because he was afraid that it was going to die with him. At age 74, he is the only other surviving member of the famous band besides Paul McCartney, and he was afraid the deception would never be revealed.

The rumors of Paul's death began more than 45 years ago, but had always been dismissed as nonsense by the band and its entourage. In September 1969, American college students published a series of articles in which they claimed that clues to McCartney's death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles' recordings. Clue-hunting rapidly proved infectious, and within a few weeks, it had become an international phenomenon. Rumours only declined after a contemporary interview with McCartney was published in Life magazine in November 1969.

Neither Paul McCartney nor anyone from his entourage have commented Ringo Starr's declaration yet, but the interview has already provoked a lot of reactions around the world. Journalists and paparazzis from around the world have surrounded the residence of the musician only minutes after the interview was broadcasted and are awaiting for the star to comment the allegations.

The British MI5 also announced an investigation to determine if an impostor could have indeed posed for 48 years as the Member of the Order of the British Empire, Sir James Paul McCartney, during official ceremonies involving Queen Elizabeth II.

In a new interview with Big Boy TV, Tyga-a month out from his split with Kylie Jenner-revealed new information about what led to the couple's demise.

Tyga, 26, said his very public relationship with Jenner, 18, took the spotlight off his own career. The couple broke up in mid-May.

""When you're in a very public relationship like that, it's hard for other people to see you differently than that,"" he said. ""Being in that ... it took a lot, career wise, everything. It overshadowed a lot of my talents and a lot of things that I worked hard for.""

Tyga said he and Jenner are still friends, and that they might reunite in the future. He suggested that Jenner's young age combined with her image had something to do with the breakup.

""She's young,"" he said. ""When you're young, you're going to make mistakes. All of those mistakes are going to be in the public eye so that puts a lot of strain on the relationship. Right now, I want to focus on what I need to do. I just wanted to get back to just me. I think for her as well.""

According to Tyga, the breakup was mutual, as the pair agreed that they needed time apart.

""It got to the point where it was like, 'I respect you, you respect me.' I think it's a mutual thing. This is what needs to happen,"" Tyga added. ""When something is so damaged or something is just not right, you can't fix it in a moment. The only thing is time.""

The following comments have been deleted:

The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. 

Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing.

 Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please.

Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes.
Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe.

Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action).

Again,I see that this is already discussed.Feral is not reliable,its a tabloid.Only reliable newspapers should be used.And these quotations in Feral,while they may be true,there are no links to check the meaning,because they may be taken out of contest,and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contest.This is not reliable.

""I take pride in how great my relationship is with Chris, but having said that, of course, in this crazy world where he's off doing movies and I'm in L.A. raising our child, of course I'm going to feel vulnerable, like any normal human would,"" she said. ""It made me feel incredibly insecure"" even though the rumors weren't true.

It's not the first time Faris talked about the rumors. She opened up to  Us Weekly at the August TCA Stars Party. ""[That] stung a little bit harder than I thought it would,"" Faris admitted about Lawrence, 24. ""I thought, 'Maybe there is a kernel of truth to that.'""

But Faris was able to make light of the situation. She joked about being jealous of Pratt's ""Jurassic World"" co-star, Blue, the dinosaur. ""Honey, what if I'm the littlest jealous of Blue? I mean, she's hot, smart, and you clearly adore her-thoughts?"" she tweeted in June 2015.

Even though Lawrence and Pratt, 37, were promoting their science fiction thriller over Faris' birthday, Pratt made sure to wish his wife a happy birthday. ""Please join me in wishing Happy Birthday to my darling @AnnaKFaris I'm sending you love from afar, beautiful lady,"" he wrote Tuesday. The post was liked more than 12,000 times by his 3.82 million Twitter followers.

Pratt and Faris married in 2009. They are parents to 4-year-old son, Jack.

2683,"Hats off to love! Jennifer Lawrence, 26, and Darren Aronofsky, 47, go public with their romance as they bundle up for stroll in NYC

They had been keeping their budding romance under wraps but it seems that Jennifer Lawrence and Darren Aronofsky have made a New Year's resolution to be more open about their relationship.

The May-December couple were spotted out together in New York City again on Monday, just a couple of days after they were seen taking Jennifer's beloved pup Pippi to a dog park in Manhattan.

The actress, 26, and the director, 47, strolled along side-by-side with Aronofsky at one point holding onto his girlfriend's arm as they walked.

The two met when Aronofsky, who shares a 10-year-old son Henry, with former fiancee Rachel Weisz, cast Lawrence in a leading role for his film Mother, due out later this year.

Filming finished in August last year and rumors about their romance started swirling in October when they were photographed together.

They confirmed their relationship after they were photographed kissing on a public street in New York.

While the filmmaker appeared up beat and beamed broadly as he spent time with his main squeeze, the actress appeared a little more reticent about showing her feelings in public, walking with her head tilted down and wearing sunglasses,

The Hunger Games star was stylish in a pair of distressed jeans paired with a black Peacoat with white sheepskin collar and trim.

She wore her blonde hair tied back into a ponytail under a jaunty peaked cap and added shiny black bovver boots.

Aronofsky, meanwhile, opted for his default outfit of puffy black jacket zipped up tight to his neck and blue jeans with brown lace-up shoes.

He added a blue knitted hat pulled down over his ears.

Lawrence gushed about her new beau in a recent interview with Vanity Fair, describing the Black Swan director as 'a visionary.'

She revealed she'd long been a fan of his work and didn't hesitate to sign up to star in his new movie even though there was no script for it at the time.

1935,"""=""""color:#4682b4"""">Coldplay Expért]] Let's talk 
This talk page is for discussing the article, not World War II history in general.   

 Summary of Consequences 

I believe that in an article one must state the consequences of historical events, and in a summary article, one must summarize the consequences. My edit, stating that """"as a result of the Franco-British action on Czechoslovakia, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed"""" is a factual statement. This is not """"Stalin's arguments"""" this is not a """"Soviet Apologist stance"""" this is a direct and undeniable consequence of said event. In the Spanish Civil War the Red Army fought side by side with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Prior to the Franco-British assisted Nazi Sudetenland Grab, relations between Nazi Germany and Soviet Union were icy. When the Nazis were declaring war on Czechoslovakia, the USSR was hard at work putting together an anti-Nazi coalition. Only after seeing the British and French backed down in the face of naked anti-Slavic aggression, did the Soviets begin to look for other allies. There is no mass conspiracy here, as the search began right after the event. This is not a motive, it's a statement of facts. If there are no more objections, I will reinsert the statement into the article, as it is merely cause and effect.   
Respectfully disagree. The statement """"as a result of the Franco-British action on Czechoslovakia, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed"""" pretends to describe a casual linkage, although in actuality, the linkage was not so obvious, and the scholars' opinion on that vary dramatically. One school thinks that the only and sincere Soviet Union's desire was to establish a collective security system and an anti-Hitler's coalition. Another school believes that the only Stalin's aim was the alliance with Hitler. The third version (the most reasonable, in my opinion) is that the USSR was almost equally suspicious and hostile towards most European powers (that was, at least partially, justified), and considered all possibilities to avoid a direct war against Germany with other major powers playing a role of neutral observers (and, to expand its territory). The statement you tried to introduce into the article is a POV of the leftist part of the first group scholars. We cannot present it here as a sole interpretation of the events. We have either to tell a full story (that is impossible because of space limitations) or to abstain from any interpretations.Interestingly, your statement may be even simply incorrect, because, according to my sources, Hitler's occupation of Czechoslovakia lead to rapprochement between the USSR, UK and France, and could lead to signing of Anti-Hitler triple alliance. In only a month after occupation of Czechoslovakia these three powers started consultations that lead to full scale political and military talks. Had Chamberlain and Stalin have a little bit less prejudice against each other, and had Ribbentrop been little bit less active, WWII could be prevented.Re: """"This is not a motive, it's a statement of facts."""" No. All these facts had already been in the article before your edits. Your wording looks like a description of motives, not statement of facts.If you still disagree, try to propose another wording that takes into account all what I wrote. In addition, a consensus exists among those who edit this article that all significant changes are being discussed on the talk page before they are introduced into the article. Try to follow this unwritten rule. That saves a lot of time and efforts.  
As there are multiple different interpretations of most key events of World War II and Wikipedia's guidelines require that all non-fringe views be given equal weight, it isn't feasible for this high-level article to discuss casual links between events.   
What Nick said, also the USSR wanting to be neutral argument falls apart, because historical evidence clearly shows that had France honored its alliance with Czechoslovakia, USSR would have intervened as well. USSR secured a passage from Romania in order to assist Czechoslovakia. USSR placed all of its divisions west of the Urals on High Alert. After the seizure of Czechoslovakia, the USSR held the UK partially responsible, and frankly did not trust them, or the French, as allies. If France failed to uphold their defensive treaty with Czechoslovakia, why would a defensive treaty with USSR",0

2414,"Jennifer Aniston on the Exact Moment She Had It With the Pregnancy Rumors

In July, Jennifer Aniston powerfully spoke out against the constant tabloid pregnancy rumors about her that have circulated through the years, in an op-ed for Huffington Post. ""For the record, I am not pregnant,"" she wrote in it. ""What I am is fed up. I'm fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment,' and 'celebrity news.'""

""If I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we, as a society, view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends and colleagues. The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing.""

The post went viral-but initially, Aniston wasn't even planning on publishing it. She told Ellen DeGeneres this week that she wrote it at first just for herself. ""You know how we kind of write and don't necessarily send it? Or at least when I was a kid I did that. And yeah, I kind of hit a wall. I was pretty raw at the time, just came back from a vacation. My mother sort of-had sort of?-she passed [away],"" Aniston said.

She and husband Justin Theroux had gone away to the Bahamas in the middle of ""nowhere"". But ""we were mobbed, like a scary kind of mob. Like, I didn't know what was happening. I kept thinking, 'Is Kim Kardashian behind me or something? This is very strange.' And then it turns out that another wonderful photograph, which I've had to sort of live with for the last 10 to 15 years: a picture of me with a bump and a circle around my stomach with an arrow pointing to it. Just in this sort of kind of objectifying way, and I was just fed up with it.""

She then poignantly echoed the point she made in her piece: that women are defined by more than just being mothers:

I think these tabloids, all of us, need to take responsibility on what we ingest into our brains. Just because we are women, we have a uterus, we have a vagina, we have ovaries, we need to like, ""Get to work, lady!"" As opposed to, hello, Freedom Medal. We as women do a lot of incredible things in this world other than just procreate-and not that that is not-but it's like we just get boxed in. They love the narrative, they love the story, they love the ""She's jealous of this person, and she's depressed, and oh my god she's never going to have a..."" Whatever the horrible little headline is, we've just got to break out of that and go whoa, whoa. And women, I have to say, are many of the authors of these horrible articles that are written in these B.S. tabloids. So, we have to stop listening to them, we have to stop buying them because we have to support each other, especially at this time, to love each other, to support, and to be proud of women, of whatever your choice is in life. It's up to us what makes us happy and fulfilled.

The outspoken comedian couldn't stand living near Lisa Hochstein and her plastic surgeon husband Dr. Lenny ""Boob God"" Hochstein on exclusive Star Island, so she sold her home of 18 years for a whopping $16.5 million.

""It was getting a little CRAZY with all those tour boats and that Miami Show...The Beverly...The Mom of Miami, whatever it is, Housewives,"" Rosie told a radio interviewer.

An insider added: ""Rosie thinks the Hochsteins are crass and totally classless, and all the nosy fans and camera crews that come with being a 'Housewife' were driving her nuts.

""She loved Star Island and many of her neighbors. She really thought she would grow old there. But because of Lisa and her husband, she decided to sell her home.""

Things hit rock bottom for Rosie last October with the heavy media coverage of the Hochsteins' Halloween party – which featured a black Jesus bound to a crucifix, a bloody zombie giving ""birth"" to a stillborn baby, and other creepy and bloody displays.

About that time, mother-of-five Rosie was contacted by a real estate agent who asked if she was interested in putting her mansion up for sale, and the en­tertainer gave a resounding yes.

The former talk-show host, who married executive-search consultant Michelle Rounds in 2012 and adopted a baby girl with her, reportedly bought a $5 million home in the far sleepier Sarasota, Fla., area.

2583,"Kim and Kanye's marriage on the rocks as she's pictured WITHOUT wedding ring

FRIENDS say Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s marriage is over.

US reality star Kim, 36, ditched her wedding ring as her relationship with the rapper hit rock bottom.

Kim ordered husband Kanye to stay away from her family’s traditional Christmas Eve bash, friends revealed last night.

Her wedding finger was bare on Saturday night as she partied with her mum and sisters at their annual festive gathering in LA.

Troubled rapper Kanye, 39, instead went to the cinema with friends.

But he then defied Kim’s warning by making a late appearance at the event.

However, she is said to have blanked her husband and insiders last night claimed their two-year marriage is “as good as over”.



 Kendall Jenner says family are praying for Kanye West's recovery

It comes at the end of a nightmare 2016 for the couple which saw Kim, 36, robbed at gunpoint in Paris in October and Kanye hospitalised a month later after a mental breakdown.

The pair put on a united front with their daughter North, three, at a ­performance of The Nutcracker ballet at an LA theatre on Friday.

However, onlookers revealed the ­couple — who also have a year-old son Saint — barely spoke to each other.

A source said: “Kim and Kanye’s marriage is as good as over. It’s looking bleak.

""She didn’t want Kanye at her mum’s Christmas bash this year, as she felt it was the first time she could really let her hair down.

“But he made a late show and spent the last hour just sitting on the couch talking to Scott Disick [dad of Kourtney’s kids] — he was a total wallflower.

“On Friday they took North to see The Nutcracker but they barely spoke or interacted inside.

""The tensions were  visible. Neither of them are in a happy place right now.

“He spent Christmas morning at Kris’ [Kim’s mum] to make things as normal for the kids as possible, but it’s just a matter of timing.

""The only thing that might keep them together is the kids.”



 New video of Kanye West ranting before he stops Sacramento gig early

Kim, who wore a gold dress at the Christmas Eve party in Calabasas, blew kisses in a video shared on her sister Khloe’s Snapchat account.

She was also sporting a new lip ring but her wedding band was off.

In the video, Khloe, 32, can be heard saying: “How dope is my f***ing sister? Look at this dress. And look at the jewellery. You are a bad*** bitch, Kim.”

The US reality star has barely been seen in public since her Paris ordeal, when she was bound and robbed at gunpoint in a reported £8.5million heist.

Kanye has cancelled all tour dates after coming out of hospital at the end of November.

He suffered a mental breakdown, with a cousin claiming he has “stopped trusting people”.

Lawrence Franklin claimed last week Kanye’s decline started after he paid £200,000 to a relative who was threatening to leak a sex tape of him.

Kim and Kanye have  also reportedly been  in counselling while the rapper is  receiving therapy.

Kim is said to be still angry after Kanye flew to New York for a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump within hours of leaving hospital.

A source said: “It was the worst thing that he has ever done in her eyes. When she tried to get him to call it off and come home, he refused.”

Any break-up is likely to lead to a complicated split of Kanye’s fortune, estimated by Forbes to be £145million.

2729,"The Secret to Ellen DeGeneres' Ageless Look

Makeup artist Pati Dubroff has worked with Ellen DeGeneres on ad campaigns and fashion spreads galore, so she knew exactly what look would work best on the talk show host for Shape's May cover shoot-natural and understated with just a hint of color. She used a damp wedge sponge to perfect our cover model's skin with just a touch of CoverGirl Simply Ageless Concealer and Corrector. ""Ellen's skin has a natural glow already, so she doesn't need much makeup,"" says Pati. Not all of us are blessed with such youthful skin, but you can get an amazing complexion like Ellen's with these anti-aging tips from the makeup pro:



You are what you eat

Ellen sticks to vegan fare and practices yoga, and it's written all over her face. Boosting your intake of antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies and cutting out processed foods helps give you that luminous look.



Cleanse carefully

Face washes that lather up contain sulfates, which can dry your skin and make fine lines and wrinkles look worse. Instead, go for a cleansing cream that doesn't suds; it will leave skin soft and get rid of makeup and grime.



Quench thirsty skin

If you're super dry, consider using a face oil at bedtime. These hydrating serums give your skin an extra plumpness and dewiness. Smooth on after cleansing and top with your night cream.



Give powder makeup the brush off

Powders can sink into lines, so switch to cream-based blushes, shadows, concealers and foundations. As you age, your skin loses radiance, so give it a boost with sheer, hydrating formulas that contain light reflecting particles.



Go easy on the eyes

Lots of eye makeup can attract attention to crows feet. Use neutral shadows and a dab of smudgey liner instead of attempting a come-hither smoky eye or garish colors.



Choose the right lip look

Tons of super shiny lip gloss can make you look like a teenager, while dark matte lipsticks can make lip lines look more prominent. Go for something in between; I recommend a hydrating sheer lipstick one shade darker than your lip tone.

2761,"Angelina Jolie, Unbroken

“I never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes,” Angelina Jolie says. “And that’s O.K., because I know who I am, and the kids know who I am.”

“I never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes,” Angelina Jolie says. “And that’s O.K., because I know who I am, and the kids know who I am.”

LOS ANGELES — Angelina Jolie was sitting barefoot on the porch of her luscious new home, explaining why she wants to save the world, when duty called. Her youngest son, Knox, 9, poked his little blond head around the screen door.

“Shiloh needs you,” the boy said quietly, referring to his middle sister, who is 11.

“Shi?” Ms. Jolie called, before disappearing with a whoosh of her black caftan. Ten minutes later, she was back. Shiloh’s beloved bearded dragon, Vlad, had fallen ill and was now, to Shiloh’s distress, convalescing at the vet’s. “That will be the rest of my day,” Ms. Jolie said, settling into a cushioned patio chair, “learning all about the health issues of the bearded dragon.”

Ms. Jolie went on to lament the imbalance of a world where Californian pets get cushy care while millions of people the world over lack access to proper medical treatment. It went unmentioned that she was saying this from her $25 million two-acre hilltop estate, in a gated pocket of the Los Feliz neighborhood, a home she bought for herself and her six children in the spring, following her split from Brad Pitt.

Perhaps more than any other celebrity, Ms. Jolie, 42, has kept herself firmly planted in two vastly different worlds. She’s both the glamorous A-lister whose every move is tracked in headlines (“Angie and the kids left Target because it didn’t serve hot dogs,” read one recent newsflash), and the humanitarian do-gooder who has made more than 60 trips to the field as part of her United Nations work. Apparent contradictions account for her elusive allure. Ms. Jolie has been enduringly hard to peg, a woman who cannot easily be lumped into a single category because she occupies many at once.

She is a peerless glamazon as well as the women’s health advocate who told the world about her preventative double mastectomy. She has a meticulously managed public profile yet professes not to care what others think. She remains near the pinnacle of celebrity’s cruel pyramid, even though her recent movies only made money when she was camouflaged (“Maleficent,” “Kung Fu Panda”). She is obsessed over — if, in the United States at least, not exactly beloved — and fixed in the cultural firmament as America’s vixen despite having a half-dozen-strong brood.

And even though the public appetite for salacious details of her personal life has long eclipsed interest in the films she has directed, Ms. Jolie doggedly brings tough, obscure stories to the screen. Three of the four movies she has made are set in wartime, including her latest, “First They Killed My Father,” based on the true story of Loung Ung, who as a young girl survived the Cambodian genocide and is now one of Ms. Jolie’s close friends.

While Ms. Jolie’s earlier movies garnered tepid reviews, several critics have anointed “First They Killed My Father” her best yet. It is told entirely from the little girl’s point of view, in Khmer, and received a standing ovation at the Telluride Film Festival, where it had its premiere. Netflix was to begin streaming it on Sept. 15, when it will also open in a small number of theaters.

Ms. Jolie said she could not have made the movie had she not first directed “In the Land of Blood and Honey” (2011) about the Bosnian war, and “Unbroken” (2014), based on the true story of an American G.I. taken prisoner in World War II. (She and Mr. Pitt starred together as a married couple locked in a different kind of conflict in her 2015 drama, “By the Sea”).

“It wasn’t a conscious plan of, I was going to make war films, it’s just what I was drawn to,” she said.

Ms. Jolie has an indelible connection to Cambodia, not least because it completely reordered her life. Before first visiting in 2000 to shoot “Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,” she had been a Hollywood wild child, a ravishing Goth weirdo who, at the Oscars that year, dressed like Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, and locked lips with her brother. She also got publicly hot and heavy with her second husband, Billy Bob Thornton, and wore a locket with droplets of his blood around her neck.

The grace and humility she saw in the Cambodian people, along with the lasting effects of the genocide, threw Hollywood life into unflattering relief.

“Once you get exposed to what’s really happening in the world, and other people’s realities, you just can’t ever not know, and you can’t ever wake up and pretend it’s not happening,” she said, “Your entire life shifts.”

She adopted Maddox, now 16, from an orphanage, divorced Mr. Thornton, and threw herself into humanitarian and environmental work, finding lasting inspiration in wartime survivors and aid workers.

“The real will to survive, and the strength of the human spirit, and the love of the human family becomes so present, and that’s how we should all be living,” Ms. Jolie said. “When you’re around it, it’s quite contagious, and you know to learn from it.”

The air pressed in hot and close as she spoke, and the sun was climbing its way toward a broiling midday. I was all but keeling over, but Ms. Jolie, who adores the heat, was as composed as a sphinx. (We soon moved to the air-conditioned climes of her kitchen.)

Ms. Jolie is a contained and poised presence, yet also light, breaking every now and then into lilting laughter. She is as visually arresting as she appears onscreen; the sculpted lines of her face alongside the soft O’s of her eyes and mouth make hers an otherworldly beauty. Though slight as a sylph, she says she doesn’t exercise, beyond dipping into the pool with her kids and vaguely intending to someday jump on a treadmill.

Although it was still August, the children — Maddox; Pax, 13; Zahara, 12; Shiloh; Knox; and his twin, Vivienne — had already begun home school. They would be accompanying her to the Telluride and Toronto film festivals — Maddox has an executive producer credit on the film — and were making up for lost lesson time, working with tutors in various corners of the house, learning, among other things, Arabic, sign language and physics.

I asked Ms. Jolie if she ever felt like the coach of a small team, and she replied that more often she felt part of a fraternity.

“They really help me so much. We’re really such a unit,” she said. “They’re the best friends I’ve ever had. Nobody in my life has ever stood by me more.”

That last sentence hung in the air, perhaps a subtle allusion to, or indictment of, Mr. Pitt, who adopted Maddox, Pax and Zahara, and is the biological father of Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne. The dissolution of their 12-year romantic partnership came last September, after an incident aboard a private jet — purportedly involving Mr. Pitt and Maddox — prompted her to file for divorce.

Shortly afterward, Ms. Jolie and the kids moved out of Mr. Pitts’s estate, living in a rental for nine months as she struggled with the decision about whether to buy a new home.

“It took me a few months to realize that I was really going to have to do it. That there was going to have to be another base regardless of everything,” she said, her voice falling quiet and low, as it would each time the subject of the split arose. “That there was going to have to be a home. Another home.”

The new house, a Beaux Arts manse that was once the residence of the legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, is a beaut, with a library, rolling lawns, cascading fountains that burble into the pool, and a view of the Griffith Observatory. Ms. Jolie had an elaborate treehouse built — “more a parkour treehouse,” she said — and the kids helped decorate and pick out the furniture for the whole house. They have an agreement, Ms. Jolie said, that not everyone can agree on everything, but you have to try to like it if you don’t hate it. If you do hate it, you can overrule.

“It has a lot of moments,” Ms. Jolie said of the home, “It’s happy. Happy and light, and we needed that.”

I asked how everyone is doing now.

“None of it’s easy. It’s very, very difficult, a very painful situation, and I just want my family healthy,” she said quietly.

Are they? “They’re getting better,” she said, her voice approaching inaudibility.

She intimated that “First They Killed My Father” might have informed her decision to leave Mr. Pitt. The film centers on Ms. Ung’s family members, some of whom survived, and Ms. Jolie said she thought a lot about what family meant during production, and how they should help each other and take care of one another (the film is adapted from Ms. Ung’s 2000 book of the same name).

“Loung had such horrors in her life but also had so much love, and that is why she’s all right today,” Ms. Jolie said. “That is something I need to remember.”

Determined to make the film as Cambodian as possible, Ms. Jolie teamed with the Cambodian director Rithy Panh, who received an Oscar nomination for his 2014 documentary, “The Missing Picture,” and enlisted thousands of Cambodians as extras. Ms. Jolie said Maddox was her right-hand man, working on the script, taking meeting notes and bantering with Mr. Panh in French. Some of the scenes were shot on massacre sites, so the crew arranged for monks to pray and set out incense and offerings beforehand.

“She is very loved there,” said Mr. Panh, who served as a producer on the film. He added that he was struck by Ms. Jolie’s humility, and how she intuitively communicated with the children on set, despite her shaky grasp of the Cambodian language. (Ms. Jolie said a suggestion in Vanity Fair that children were cruelly hoodwinked in the casting process was “a mischaracterization.”)

Ms. Ung said Ms. Jolie, who has Cambodian citizenship, shares her countrymen’s sensibilities. “In Cambodia you don’t raise your voice, you speak kindly to people, you greet people with your hands together and bow,” Ms. Ung said. “All of this comes naturally to her.”

As our interview wrapped, Ms. Jolie joked that she would next work on a comedy. “I will get funny at some point,” she said, adding that she was working on “Maleficent 2,” a sequel to the Disney fractured fairy tale. “That was a little funny,” she said, wryly.

Ms. Jolie also seemed aware of how she might be beheld by the public; the removed ice queen to Mr. Pitt’s affable down-home Missouri boy (his revealing interview in the summer issue of GQ Style helped burnish his image as the more relatable one). But she grew up a punk in school, she said, and was used to not fitting in, and being someone people had opinions about.

“I never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes,” Ms. Jolie said, walking me down her driveway, “And that’s O.K., because I know who I am, and the kids know who I am.”

She quickly embraced me goodbye, and I set off into the sun and the heat, as the heavy security gate slowly drew shut behind.

White Witch warns Angelina against using spells to woo back Brad


A white witch from North London has urged Hollywood star Angelina Jolie to cease dabbling in magic to try to woo back ex-husband Brad Pitt.

Back in September, Star magazine reported that Angelina was 'turning to bizarre spiritual rituals in an effort to fix her life and get Brad back', but Carrie Kirkpatrick, 51, says she knew that what the actress was doing was very wrong.

'When you use spells to try and win someone back, you have to be very careful what you wish for,' Carrie told FEMAIL. 'Brad and Angelina split up for a reason, so if she succeeds in getting back with him, she may end up unhappy.

'She is making a foolish mistake if she thinks she can manipulate him back into her life using magic. He has free will. If they are meant to be together, then love and their highest selves will find a way.'

Carrie, who is ordained as a Priestess Of the Goddess and teaches people how to connect with the 'mystical goddess energies', also noted how Angelina and Brad had a mutual tattooing session last year, months before their union ended,

It was a symbolic effort to 'bind their marriage', but it failed because she was 'forcing' them to stay together, she said.

Carrie says Angelina has always been interested in the 'dark arts'.

'The way she used to wear her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton's blood in a vial around her neck, this is a form of blood magic,' she explained.

'It feeds into her tendencies towards BDSM. For her, obsession and possession equal love.'

'Angelina is known to have a strong interest in the occult, especially Voodoo and Hoodoo.

Carrie has shared a spell for those looking for love at Halloween, but advises that anyone who uses it must have pure intentions. Trying to control someone else’s will, as she believes Angelina is doing with her magic, won’t work.  'When a person works magic to ""keep"" or ""get"" a particular love interest, it may work, but only for a short period of time,' she said.  Light the incense, turn down the lights and play the music softly.  Anoint the candle with rose or jasmine oil and, focusing on the candle, call upon the Goddess, saying: 'Great Goddess Hathor, Goddess of Love, of Beauty and Joy, I ask that you be here present this night, that I may voice my true desire for a lover in my life who will lift my heart with passionate joy.  May they be guided to my side that we may share a love so true. May our hearts sing with joy in honour of you. Guide me to be in the right place at the right time to meet my heart’s desire, and that they be ready and willing to love me with a passion equal to mine. Show me my new love, O Goddess divine.' Now light the candle and place it in the candlestick on a table and say: 'So mote it be!' Then take the handheld mirror and gaze into it. Allow your eyes to lose their focus and, as you look at your reflection, see if another face appears before you. Who is it? Is it someone you already know?  Perhaps you will see yourself in a particular situation, look at where you are, taking note of the details. How do you appear? Who else is there? This may be where you meet your lover.  When you feel ready, re-focus your eyes and bring your awareness back into the room. Thank Hathor for gifting you the vision and say: 'Hail and farewell.' Then let the candle burn all the way down.

'Whilst these traditions are not necessarily dark, there is the option here to use the magic for a darker purpose.

'In all magic, the choice between working the spell for good or bad is really down to the intention of the practitioner.

'It's like opening a very potent toolbox, you can use the tools however you wish, but there will be consequences.

'This is why we recommend proper training in magical practice. It's to protect the practitioner as well as the subjects of their magic,' said Carrie.

Angelina is also a devotee of tattoos and before she split from Brad, the couple were inked alongside one another by ex Thai monk Ajarn Noo Kanpai, who they flew to Siem Reap in Cambodia in February 2016 to work on the symbolic designs.

She acquired three new mystical sak yant back inkings from the Thai artist, a style which encompasses lines of script, geometric patterns and animal shapes, while Brad had the left side of his stomach tattooed with a Buddhist symbol.

The process was meant to 'symbolically bind them as husband and wife', but they ended up splitting in September 2016.

Carrie said: 'This is a classic case of the magic rebounding, as she was trying to force them to stay together.

'She uses her tattoos as protective talismans but they are not linked to witchcraft.

'They're magical though, in that she associates them with protective qualities. So she is using the magic of the Far East. This is not witchcraft as we on the West know it - it's the ""magic"" of another culture.'

The star also reportedly used magic to woo her man, by presenting him with a vial of grey powder that turned out to be a cremated bat, purportedly to ward off negative energies and accidents.

'It's more likely that this was intended to bind him to her,' Carried explained.

'She comes across as a bit insecure so she may have felt that she needed the magic to seal the deal and prevent any other witches or occultists from attacking her or sabotaging her love life.

It's all about the sex with Angelina, and by that I mean the power she can exert over a man. This is like an elixir, the ultimate possession.

'She clearly wanted Brad very much and would not consider letting him go. But ultimately, this is a fool's game as there's no point in trying to make someone be with you.

'They have free will and entrapping them will only lead to unhappiness. Why would anyone want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with them?'

Assisting the lovelorn is one of Carrie's many talents. 'I've helped all kinds of people using magic,' she says. 'People with legal issues, love troubles, fears and insecurities.

'I guide them through transformation in their lives, by showing them how to face their fears and follow their true path.'

When working with people who've come to her, Carrie has found that some are – or have been – witches.

'I believe that many people are born witches, and that they have been witches, healers and psychics in previous lives. These people often bring with them a fear of persecution due to the history of so many witches being executed,' she claims.

'When working with them, it's important for me to help them heal past life trauma so that they can be themselves in this life and do the work that they're destined to do.

2595,"Tom Hiddleston Still Embarrassed About Taylor Swift: Ignores Fans and Media at Comic-Con | Celeb Dirty Laundry

For the past several years, actor Tom Hiddleston has been a fan favorite at the San Diego Comic-Con. But this year, fans of the actor were left disappointed when he chose to ignore them and the media while he and the cast of the upcoming superhero film, “Thor: Ragnarok” were at Comic-Con to promote their film, which will hit theaters later this year. Tom Hiddleston’s portrayal of villan, Loki in the comic book superhero movie, “Thor” has garnered him legions of fans, mostly female who love his bad boy portrayal of the character.

Although Tom Hiddleston did participate in a panel with the other actors to answer questions about their upcoming film, he chose to skip the the opportunity to take photos with fans or sign autographs. This has left his fans feeling disappointed because some fans actually traveled thousands of miles for the chance to see Tom and get a picture with him.

This is a huge departure from years past, when Tom Hiddleston made it a point to see as many fans as possible. In 2013, while promoting “Thor: The Dark World”, Tom surprised and delighted fans by coming to the convention dressed in his full Loki costume. But this year he all but ignored his fans and only briefly appeared on the panel with the other actors and director of the movie, and left the convention as soon as the panel was over.

Audience members also remarked that the usually charming actor didn’t appear too excited to be at Comic-Con, with some of Tom’s own fans commenting that the actor appeared to look sad or unhappy. And it wasn’t just his fans that Tom ignored, he also chose to not speak to the media while at the convention. Besides a few questions from fans and the media during the panel discussion, Tom refused to be interviewed by journalists.

Many believe Tom is still embarrassed by his whirlwind romance with pop star Taylor Swift. Tom and Taylor Swift dated last summer and were heavily criticized for their public displays of affection, including Tom’s decision to wear a tank top declaring his love for the pop star.

Of course, Tom and Taylor Swift’s romance only lasted a few months, but it has been reported that his brief romance with the singer has hurt his Hollywood career, and may have even cost him the opportunity to take over the role of James Bond. For the past few months, Tom has kept a low profile with fans and the media, no doubt in hopes of avoiding questions about his past relationship with Taylor Swift.

 Re:Dennis Brown's final warning 

I didn't mention that it was mutual because it was not relevant. I didn't violate the final warning; CurtisNaito did (multiple times). The exact wording of the warning was """"If either editor pushes the boundaries of incivility, bludgeons a discussion, violates WP:IDHT, acts in a disruptive manner on any talk page, or breaching any other policy that makes editing miserable for other editors, then either myself or another admin should simply block for a minimum of 72 hours."""" At no point did I push the boundaries of civility, bludgeon a discussion, violate IDHT, act in a disruptive manner on any talk page, or breach any other policy that made editing miserable for other editors. CurtisNaito displayed the exact same kind of IDHT behaviour that has made editing miserable for me and multiple other editors on numerous occasions, and when told explicitly that he was violating Dennis Brown's final warning, he kept doing it.

Your choosing to butt in with a comment about how the warning was mutual, when nothing I had done could conceivably be taken as a violation of the warning, was an off-topic attack against me with no basis in what actually happened.

I understand you don't like me, but would you please keep it to the appropriate forums rather than continuously posting personal attacks against me on other users' talk pages where normal etiquette prevents me from responding directly?

2740,"Keeping Up With Kendall Jenner

When it was announced last week that Kendall Jenner would be the new face of Estée Lauder, a coveted contract that in the past has gone to actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow and Elizabeth Hurley and supermodels like Joan Smalls, the company did not promote the news by way of the usual public-relations machine, with news releases or email blasts.

Instead, after Vogue broke the story on its website, in anticipation of a 13-page spread in the magazine, Ms. Jenner was encouraged to tell the public herself, on her own Instagram account. That post quickly garnered more than a million ""likes,"" 50,000-plus comments and many, many heart-eyed emoji.

It was the latest plum appointment for Ms. Jenner, 19, a daughter of Kris and Bruce Jenner, and a half sister to Kim, Khloé and Kourtney Kardashian. Her seemingly meteoric rise over the last few years has taken her from a sulky minor player on the sometimes cringe-inducing but highly successful reality show ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" to a tentative career as a teenage model to the runways of the major fashion shows (Chanel, Marc Jacobs and Givenchy, among them). Along the way, she has all but redefined what it takes to become a high-profile model.

Ms. Jenner is tall, dark-haired, doe-eyed and beautiful. But so are hundreds of other girls who walk the runways of New York, Milan and Paris and thousands more who dream of one day doing so. What they don't have are Ms. Jenner's 16 million followers on Instagram, 9.1 million on Twitter and 7.3 million likes on Facebook (numbers that will surely have grown by the time you read this). Like many other 19-year-old girls, she uses these accounts to share photos of herself, her family and friends. Unlike many 19-year-old girls, she also uses them to plug her many partnerships and commercial projects.

""I think what's so exciting about her is that she has this social media influence along with a fashion credibility in a distinct way that speaks to millennials,"" said Jane Hertzmark Hudis, the global brand president of Estée Lauder. ""There is really no one else like her out there.""
Like her older siblings, with their retail stores, fragrance lines, nail polishes and more, Ms. Jenner juggles multiple brand extensions premised on her family fame. With her younger sister, Kylie, she is marketing a collection of clothes and accessories for PacSun, one of shoes for Steve Madden's Madden Girl line and a science-fiction young adult novel set in a dystopian future colony called Indra.

But the Kardashian affiliation that first brought her to the world's attention has put her on a peculiar perch: followed by millions but navigating aversion in a cloistered industry accustomed to minting its own stars, and a historically wary - but steadily warming - relationship with the Kardashian family. (Ms. Jenner's agent and several of her clients, including Ms. Hudis, claimed not to watch ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians,"" now filming its 10th season.)

""It's definitely two different worlds. I feel like Hannah Montana. But it's fun,"" Ms. Jenner said, referring to Miley Cyrus's character, who navigates a double life in and out of the spotlight, on the Disney sitcom that began her career and pop stardom. (Of course, both of Ms. Jenner's worlds are squarely in the public eye.)

For modeling purposes, and with a touch of wishful thinking, Ms. Jenner prefers to go by simply ""Kendall."" In person, she is charming but terse, with a daffy sweetness if not necessarily the gift of gab.

When she presented at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards, she famously muffed her lines, dissolving into giggles and admitting, ""Guys, I'm the worst reader."" At a fitting at Marc Jacobs's office - during which a crowd of teenage girls gathered outside of the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of her - she was taken with a publicist's striking eye color. ""Are those your real eyes?"" she asked.

She arrived for a recent interview at her agency's office dressed model-casual: Céline slip-on sneakers, a black T-shirt and skinny pants (tag still on) by which designer she wasn't sure. They had shown up unbidden at her house, like much else, a perk not every model enjoys.

She is the first to acknowledge that she was not always interested in style. ""On Season 1 of our show, I would wear, like, neon green jeans and a white polo shirt, the craziest things,"" she said, though in her defense, when ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" premiered in 2007, Ms. Jenner was 11 years old.

She called modeling a lifelong dream. ""I would literally sit at home and have my friends take pictures of me on my little Canon camera that my mom gave me for Christmas,"" she said. ""Obviously, the show was me being in front of a camera. It's just something that I've kind of always been around.""
Initial forays into modeling were small in scale. In 2011, Ms. Jenner appeared in the New York Fashion Week show of Sherri Hill, a designer from Austin, Tex., who specializes in event and prom dresses.

Earlier that year, Ms. Jenner's appearance at a shoot of Ms. Hill's dresses had been a plot point on an episode of ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians."" But Ms. Jenner's role on the show had largely been as a sidekick to her scenery-chewing sisters.

With a new agency, The Society Management, specializing in high-end fashion bookings, behind her, Ms. Jenner is now working to rebrand. ""We had to be very strategic and specific,"" she said, ""to really have people take me seriously and not mess around.""

The perceived divide between commercial and high fashion is so wide that, when asked whether Ms. Jenner's well-documented Sherri Hill appearance had been her New York Fashion Week debut, a Society representative declined to confirm, writing, ""we recall her as still being in school during that period.""

With a name like hers, fairly or not, there have been detractors for as long as there have been supporters.

""It always comes as a shock when I tell the story of how I casted Kendall,"" Riccardo Tisci wrote in an email about his decision to use Ms. Jenner in his Givenchy show and ad campaign. ""I didn't do it because of my links to her sister or to Kanye, as everyone seems to believe. I only chose Kendall because I thought she was amazing, a striking, dark, edgy beauty, exactly the way I like them.""

Even with prominent advocates, Ms. Jenner's rise was freighted with uncertainty. ""Her agent was very aware that she had one shot at being a credible model,"" said the stylist and Love Magazine editor Katie Grand, an early champion, who in February orchestrated Ms. Jenner's return to New York Fashion Week by placing her in Marc Jacobs's show.

When The Society first asked her to consider Ms. Jenner, Ms. Grand was reluctant. ""I didn't even really know who she was other than someone I thought went skiing with Harry Styles once,"" she said, alluding to Ms. Jenner's alleged former beau. (The rumor mill has linked Ms. Jenner to Mr. Styles, of One Direction, and Justin Bieber, among others.)

Ms. Grand said her first reaction was ""underwhelmed."" Ms. Jenner's shyness can read as standoffish, and she is still developing the presence that can distinguish a top model. Even today on the runway, she can often blend into the endless parade of willowy but indeterminable young women, without the identifiable prowl of a model like Karlie Kloss, or the seasoned charisma of one like Naomi Campbell.

Ms. Jenner's agent begged for one more appointment. On a follow-up visit, Ms. Grand found her less shy, more spirited and ambitious. ""There's lots of people that I've worked with at a time before they kicked into the fashion world or fashion consciousness,"" she said. ""Marc is very aware of that, because we've worked together for so long. He kind of humors me a bit. It's always a bit of an eye glaze and 'Really? Are we really going to do that?' ""

They did. Mr. Jacobs, initially skeptical, came around, largely because, Ms. Grand said, ""she looked really good in the clothes."" The reaction, thanks in no small part to the look Ms. Jenner wore - which included a breast-baring, sheer top - was immediate. ""I was in a car on the way to the airport immediately after the show to go to London,"" Ms. Grand said. ""I was just looking through Twitter and it was everywhere. I think I didn't really realize it would be such a thing.""

But despite the ensuing cacophony (not only from fashion blogs, but also The Daily Mail, Fox News and more), Ms. Jenner kept a limited schedule that season, walking only for Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Tisci, Giles Deacon in London (another Ms. Grand client) and Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel.

More followed. She appeared in Chanel's Couture show in July and on the cover of Ms. Grand's Love Magazine. During the Spring 2015 season in September, she expanded her show list to add Diane von Furstenberg, Tommy Hilfiger and Dolce & Gabbana, among others. She is one of a handful of models in the new Karl Lagerfeld spring ad campaign, and is said to be in spring ads for Marc Jacobs as well. (Michael Ariano, a representative for Marc Jacobs, said he could neither confirm nor deny this.)

Although she said she was happiest to go unrecognized at castings and shows - even, in one case, being asked by a makeup artist, ""Did you know Kendall Jenner is here?"" - the media has noted her every appearance, and stoked rumors.

In Touch Weekly reported that other models, threatened by Ms. Jenner's ascendancy, taunted her by putting out cigarettes in her drink. (Ms. Jenner's representatives dispute this.) OK! Magazine splashed a runway shot and a photo of a weeping Kim across its cover under the headline, ""Kendall: 'I'm the Hot One Now!' ""

There are those in the industry who resent the intrusion of celebrity into the hermetic runway world, though Ms. Jenner's high profile largely ensures that they complain privately rather than publicly. Ms. Jenner is not the only model to make the leap - her friends Gigi Hadid, a daughter of the ""Real Housewife of Beverly Hills"" Yolanda Foster, and Hailey Baldwin, a daughter of Stephen Baldwin, have, too - but she is the most famous.

Ms. Jenner's dual citizenship, as it were, in the realms of fashion and celebrity is a decisive factor in her appeal.

After the announcement of her Estée Lauder campaign, social media responded, both in favor of Ms. Jenner's appointment and opposed to it. ""@EsteeLauder Have you lost your mind..."" asked one user on Twitter. ""Do you really understand your customer base... Where did you pluck Kendall Jenner from""?

But its executives know both who their customers are - in the United States and Europe, women as close to Kris Jenner's age as to Kendall's - and who they hope new ones might be. According to data provided by the company, on the Saturday of the announcement, EstéeLauder.com received six times the number of unique visitors as on an average Saturday. Within 48 hours of the announcement, 90 percent of visitors to the site were first-timers, 71 percent viewing the site on a mobile device.

""It speaks volumes to where we are right now in terms of nontraditional media,"" said Chris Gay, the general manager of The Society, of the Estée Lauder campaign. ""Millennials are not into traditional media. How they're getting their media is completely fractured.""

As models have gone from muses to marketing partners, their social presences, global reach and audience engagement have become a more important part of their appeal. ""There's no Q ratings for models,"" Mr. Gay said, referring to Q Scores, a measurement of consumer awareness of and favorability toward brands, characters and personalities. ""That was never part of the equation. But now you have real analytics.""

(The Q Scores Company does in fact track a number of models. Ms. Jenner has an awareness percentage of 33 among the general population, which puts her in line with actresses like Kerry Washington, and only 2 percentage points below Gisele Bündchen, the world's highest-paid model. Her Q score, measuring the percentage of respondents who called her one of their favorites, is 10 to Ms. Bündchen's 13.)

Ms. Jenner's friend Olivier Rousteing, the creative director of Balmain, depended less on analytics than personal experience when he decided, after spending time with her at Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's wedding, to cast her in his spring show. But he was not insensitive to the pull she exerts on young women worldwide.

""She's really communicating to a lot of girls,"" he said. ""You know, like those models in the 90s, Claudia, Naomi - young girls were dreaming of being a model. I think Kendall is bringing these things. Girls are dreaming about how to be her.""

Ms. Jenner did not care to parse the various interpretations the world has offered on her rise.

""Some people are hesitant with me, and they just worry or wonder for a second,"" she said. ""But then when the chance gets taken . ...""

2612,"Ben Affleck Has A New Fresh Face: BOTOX BEN

FRESHENED UP!?!? After a VERY ROUGH year, doctors say that it appears that Ben Affleck his face freshened up! The rumored help? Botox for his crow’s feet & fillers to soften the lines around his mouth.

“Ben is obsessed about growing old,” a pal tells NAUGHTY GOSSIP. “He will do whatever it takes to feel hot and young, thats is why he was hooking up with a 20-something nanny. That didn’t work out so well, and neither will all the plastic surgery.”

Affleck is rumored to have used cosmetic dentistry to help achieve his perfectly white, straight teeth. Affleck may also be using Botox injections to keep his face wrinkle-free.

“Ben had the heavy beard so conceal any plastic surgery,” adds another pal. “He is addicted to it. Lets face it, we all know Ben has a huge ego, he looks in the mirror for fours, deciding what he needs to get done next.”

Ben is also trying to look young to win back his ex wife Jennifer Garner who was seen with a mystery man in Malibu, California, just more than four months after she and Affleck announced they were divorcing.

Garner was seen chilling out with her daughter and an unidentified man. The man was “clearly no stranger to Garner’s kids as he held on to her daughter’s bike seat.”

Following their divorce announcement, Affleck was caught in scandal alleging him of having affair with his children’s nanny. It was reported recently that Garner decided to forgive Affleck over the nanny affair.

2772,"A Detailed History of Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber’s On-Again, Off-Again Relationship

2,518 days ago, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez were spotted—arm in arm—at a Philadelphia IHOP. And so began the long, complicated, and endless saga of “Jelena,” which, in its latest of many twists, has the on-again, off-again couple “hanging out” again amidst news of Gomez’s breakup with The Weeknd.

How did we get here, exactly? You’re forgiven for not knowing. After all, IHOP was centuries ago, or at least 2010, when Barack Obama was a first-term president and America watched American Idol and Survivor . Here’s a comprehensive guide to their on-and-off, up-and-down, are-they-or-aren’t-they relationship.

TMZ breaks the news that the teen idols enjoyed a “cuddly” date at an IHOP in Philadelphia ahead of a Q102’s Jingle Ball. Gomez tells Us Weekly that it was platonic, and that Bieber is “one of my best friends . . . It was just pancakes!”

Bieber, too, stays mum on the subject, telling MTV that she’s “an amazing person,” but, “I think that people are always gonna be interested in my personal life . . . but I gotta keep some things to myself. I’m just having fun being a teenager.”

With dating rumors swirling, paparazzi pictures catch the then 16- and 18-year-olds kissing on a yacht in St. Lucia, essentially proving what fans already suspected—they’re an item.

At the Vanity Fair Oscar Party, the teen-dream couple made their red carpet debut together , thereby confirming their relationship. They even take some lovey-dovey pictures in the photo booth.

May 2011—Young and (Visibly) in Love

After a glamorous appearance at the Billboard Music Awards , Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez jet off to Maui, Hawaii. Photographers catch them canoodling in the ocean –Gomez noticeably rocking some statement hoops—and the photos go viral.

Here we reach peak Jelena— reports surface that Bieber rented the entire Staples Center arena so he and his lady love could watch Titanic , alone. “Romance isn’t dead,” Bieber tweeted. “Treat your lady right fellas.”

A storm brews in paradise as a woman accuses Bieber of fathering her child . After a paternity test, the case is thrown out.

For the next 10 months, all seems content on the Jelena front. They’re spotted at a Lakers game, on a helicopter ride, at the Teen Choice Awards, and celebrating her birthday. But some tabloid sites start alleging that the two may not be as solid as people think.

Bieber and Gomez break up for the first time. Conflicting schedules, trust issues, and their young ages are all rumored to be causes of the demise.

Although the two aren’t together, and despite the fact that Gomez tells Ryan Seacrest “it’s not really about a specific person,” fans theorize that her new song “Come & Get It,” with lyrics like “Can’t stop because I love it, hate the way I love you / All day all night, maybe I’m addicted for life, no lie,” is about Bieber.

Fuel is added to the fire when Bieber allegedly posts—and then quickly deletes— an Instagram with Gomez.

But at the end of 2013, Bieber admits the two aren’t speaking , although he still loves her.

2014—Are They or Aren’t They?

2014, to put it lightly, was a confusing year in the Jelena timeline . First of all, it’s the year that Bieber’s image goes full-on bad boy—after bizarre incidents in 2013, like peeing in a bucket and losing custody of his monkey—he gets in real, tangible trouble. In January alone, he’s arrested for drunk driving, resisting arrest, and driving without a valid license, and he was also accused of vandalism for egging his neighbors. (January isn’t great for Gomez, either, who checks into rehab .) The tabloids viciously suggest it’s because of Bieber and/or a drug problem, but a frustrated Gomez later tells GQ that it was to seek help for lupus.

But before the rehab and before the DUI, the couple is spotted riding Segways in Calabasas, California . Throughout the year, and all the drama, the “maybe dates” continue: a Starbucks run in Texas and a day at the zoo. Then, the Instagram—Bieber posts (and also deletes) a bunch of pictures of his former beau, including one that calls their love “unconditional.”

But concurrently woven in those sightings are other ones . . . with Bieber and other women. He’s associated with a slew of models, up-and-coming actresses, and other beauties—including Kendall and Kylie Jenner, who Gomez at one point reportedly unfollows on Instagram , and she also unfollowed Bieber.

Then there’s the international incident in July 2014, when Orlando Bloom and Justin Bieber get into fist fight , allegedly over Gomez.

In November, Gomez releases “The Heart Wants What It Wants,” which she suggests is about Bieber. She gives an emotional performance of the song at the American Music Awards, which some signal to mean the relationship has finally run its course. That same month, Bieber unfollows her on Instagram . In December, he posts a picture of himself with Hailey Baldwin, but in the caption says he’s “super single.”

2015—Are They or Aren’t They? (Part Two)

We’re entering the second of the lost Jelena years, where no one knows quite what’s going on, perhaps not even the Bieber and Gomez themselves.

After being spotted holding hands at a Golden Globes party, Gomez and Zedd enjoy a brief romance. Zedd admits two years later to Billboard that he wasn’t ready to date an international superstar like Gomez: “Reporters were calling my parents. People were hacking my friends’ phones. I was pissed. [Though] I kind of knew what I was getting myself into,” he said.

Bieber continues to post throwback pictures of Gomez on Instagram, confusing just about everyone— including Drake . Reconciliation rumors ramp up after he tells Ellen DeGeneres that a number of songs on his new album Purpose are about Gomez, and a video surfaces of Bieber serenading her with “My Girl” at a hotel in Beverly Hills.

But Gomez makes it clear she’s sick of being defined by their relationship. In her cover story with Elle , she says her November 2014 AMA performance was her personal life swan song. “Everybody was talking about the same thing: my relationship,” she remembers. “I was so exhausted. I said, ‘I want this [performance] to be the last time I have to talk about this. And acknowledge this feeling.’ ”

Early 2016—Here We Go Again

In January 2016, Justin Bieber posts steamy pictures with Hailey Baldwin in St. Barth’s , which many take to mean they are dating. The speculation increases when Baldwin makes a cameo in Bieber’s GQ cover story. He describes her as “someone I really love. We spend a lot of time together.”

However, Baldwin later tells Marie Claire that they weren’t ever official. “We are not an exclusive couple. He’s about to go on tour,” she said. “Relationships at this age are already complicated, but I don’t really like to talk about it because it’s between me and him.”

Bieber posts a throwback picture of him and Gomez kissing, and she comments “perfect.”

Although claiming they’re just friends , Bieber posts a series of Instagrams with Sofia Richie. However, after backlash from fans, Bieber posted “I’m gonna make my Instagram private if you guys don’t stop the hate this is getting out of hand, if you guys are really fans you wouldn’t be so mean to people that I like.”

Gomez responded in the comments section: “If you can’t handle the hate then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol—it should be special between you two only. Don’t be mad at your fans. They love you.”

That, allegedly, kicked off a full-on Instagram war between the couple, involving many comments, including cheating accusations on both sides, which are now said to be deleted. Gomez later takes to her Snapchat to say that what she did was “selfish and pointless.” Bieber deletes his Instagram.

A few months later, it's reported that Gomez cut her Revival Tour short to seek treatment at a facility in Tennessee. “My self-esteem was shot. I was depressed, anxious. I started to have panic attacks right before getting onstage, or right after leaving the stage. Basically I felt I wasn’t good enough, wasn’t capable,” she later told Vogue.

Gomez and The Weeknd hit the red carpet couple together at the 2017 Met Gala.

Gomez reveals on Instagram that she underwent a kidney transplant. (The donor was her friend Francia Raisa.)

Bieber and Gomez are seen hanging out together again , but multiple sources say it’s just as friends. Allegedly, their church, Hillsong, as well as Gomez’s kidney transplant caused to two to reconnect. And The Weeknd was reportedly fine with it.

However, just about a week after the reports, Selena Gomez and The Weeknd announce their split (although, apparently, Bieber was not the cause).

In the weeks following Gomez’s breakup with The Weeknd, she's spotted canoodling with Bieber. . . again and again and again. On November 15, they kiss at his hockey game—fueling tabloid speculation that they are back together and better than ever.

Maybe, or maybe not. Because if this timeline has taught you anything, dear reader, it should be that at this point, the truth is anybody’s guess.

Dying to know why Kevin Hart’s wife Eniko Parrish is staying by his side as his cheating scandal rages on? Our insider has the EXCLUSIVE details! Read on!


Nothing tests a marriage like infidelity. And all that heartbreak is presumably dialed up to 11 when it’s a highly publicized ordeal like Kevin Hart‘s, 38, current cheating scandal. All this has fans wondering if and when his pregnant wife Eniko Parrish, 33, is going to call it quits! Well, according to our insider, the stunning mama-to-be has no intention of ending their marriage! Need more pics of Kevin and Eniko? Head right here!

“Eniko is hurt and angry but she’s nowhere near ready to walk away,” a source close to Eniko shares with HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “She simply can‘t imagine her life without Kevin. He’s her world and it’s been that way since she was 23 years old. Throwing it all away over one mistake is just not something she can do right now.” Wow! She sounds ready for the long haul! Maybe Kevin’s push present helped as well!?

Our insider went on to add that staying is more about her baby’s future than her own. It’s also a way to maintain some stability as they ride out this painful controversy. “Leaving him is not even a question, she’s in her third trimester and already thinking like a mamma bear. Her child’s needs come first. And right now Eniko knows she needs to stay as calm and centered as possible. Breaking up with Kevin right now is only going to put more stress on her.” Here’s hoping things improve before their baby arrives.

The controversial reality TV star really wants to change her reputation. We have learned that Kim Kardashian wants to have a much more political image and she’s already making the first few steps in that direction.

According to a source close to the famous family, Kim would like to hire herself a political publicist and Kanye West has been looking for one.

In a recent interview with Harper’s Bazaar Arabia, Kim revealed that she’d love to become a more politically active celeb but is scared of making any mistakes and offending people.

‘Sometimes I feel like I want to speak out more about political issues. You have to be really careful about what you say, because a lot of things can be taken in the wrong context and I always want to be respectful; I do not want to hurt anyone’s feelings. I said once before that I am not really a feminist. But I feel like I do a lot more than people that claim that they are feminist. To clarify what I said before: I feel in my soul I am a feminist. I just don not need labels to make me feel or know what I am inside,’ the Kardashian explained.

She went on to say that for her, feminists are all of the girls around us and on social media that stand up for themselves and for certain issues.

For the KUWK star, those women are the most empowering.

Do you think it’s a good idea for Kim to become more vocal about her political views?

Loads of stars stepped out for the Hollywood Stands Up to Cancer event in LA on Tuesday night. The fundraiser, which was hosted by Reese Witherspoon and her husband, Jim Toth, brought out cute couples like Diane Kruger and Joshua Jackson and Jessica Alba and Cash Warren, as well as Selena Gomez, Drew Barrymore, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Gwyneth herself has been a longtime supporter of the Stand Up to Cancer program since her father, Bruce Paltrow, died of lung cancer in 2002.

Also on hand for the star-studded event was Anne Hathaway, who is easing her way back into the spotlight after a sweet Hawaiian vacation with her husband, Adam Shulman. Most recently, the pair popped up at the Sundance Film Festival to premiere Anne's latest project, Song One. She was joined in chilly Park City by Diane and Joshua, who stirred up engagement rumors after Diane was spotted with a giant diamond ring on that finger - we caught a glimpse of the bauble on Tuesday evening, despite Diane trying to keep her hand in her pocket!

 Msa Garratts 

Hi,

The idea about an article is a good one, but unfortunately you've started out with an error. That is understandable as the subject is complex. 

The WAGR first imported the M class Garratts, in 1911. These are very important locos, because they are the third class of Garratt to be built, and the first """"main line"""" Garratt, showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.

The Msa class were constructed in 1930 by the WAGR in their own workshops. Apparently a copy of the Ms class, they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.

The story does not end there, but moves to Victoria. The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6"""" line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939. The boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored G42.

So in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of 28 years, used on three railway, on two gauges and built by two manufacturers, with, if I've added it up correctly, 27 locos constructed.

Personally I think the article should cover the history of the design, and include all the varients. Some work would be required to hunt down variations, though. So yes, I think it does deserve an article.

Please feel free to use the above if you wish.

Cheers,

Michael.""",0

Is he really the senior male-line dynastic descendant of Victoria & Albert? Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester is the most senior male-line male descendant of Victoria & Albert as he is the surviving son of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester and, as the Duke's two elder brothers, Edward and Albert (who reigned as George VI) had no sons, is since the death of his elder brother, William in 1972, the senior male-line male grandchild of George V, who was the surviving son of Edward VII, the first son of Victoria & Albert. Prince Andreas is a descendant of Leopold, Duke of Albany, who was Victoria and Albert's fourth son and Edward VII's youngest brother. Thus, he can't be considered as the senior male-line descendant of Victoria and Albert but, through dynastic changes in succession with renounciation of rights to the throne of Coburg by the future Edward VII and the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, he is the current titular Duke and thus is, with no doubt, the head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Nonethelles, his British cousins from the Windsor family are agnatically senior to his family. We can say that Prince Andreas is the senior male-line descendant of Prince Albert in right of the former realm of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, as the elder lines of his descendants (thourgh Edward VII and Arthur, Duke of Connaught, now extinct in male-line) renounced their rights to it, but definitely he is not Prince Albert's senior male-line descendant in general.",0

2723,"Lindsay Lohan talks drugs, booze, rehab, sex

Just days before checking into court-ordered rehab last week, the actress spoke extensively to Piers Morgan in an article for London's Daily Mail newspaper, which published it in this Sunday's edition.

She's spent more than 250 days in rehab and another trip ""is pointless,"" she said in the Daily Mail story. Instead, she should be allowed to ""go abroad to different countries and work with children.""

Lohan's life and career ran off the rails starting in her disastrous year of 2007 when she was twice convicted of drunken driving, once for cocaine use, made three trips to rehab and served an 84-minute jail stay. Her arrests were ""totally irresponsible -- a stupid mistake,"" she said.

""And from then on, the press were on me all the time,"" Lohan said. ""It was the first time I'd taken drugs. I was out in a club with people I shouldn't have been with, and took cocaine, and got in the car. It was so stupid.""

Her first rehab visit was not because of drugs or alcohol but to help her deal with the trauma she experienced making a movie, she told Morgan.

She voluntary checked into the Wonderland Center in Los Angeles while she was shooting ""I Know Who Killed Me"" in January 2007.

""I was having really bad nightmares, and the movie was pretty traumatizing,"" Lohan said. ""So I stayed in a facility so I could get some sleep and talk about it with someone the next day, because it was overwhelming. But I would leave every day and just sleep there at night. I liked that. It was kind of like having my own live-in therapist, because I was having crazy nightmares and I was having AA meetings on set and stuff. It really helped.""

She had been drinking for less than a year at that point, Lohan said. She stayed away from alcohol after her first hangover experience at 17, when her mother made her ""sleep with vomit still on me so I'd understand how it felt,"" she said. ""I was too scared!""

She was a good teenager, she said. ""My friends and I would actually pretend to be drunk,"" she said. ""And it was more fun. I never rebelled against my parents -- I worked hard, I was responsible and I didn't go to high-school parties.""

She doesn't consider herself to be an alcoholic -- ""I've never woken up in the morning and had a drink"" -- but ""when I was younger, I was definitely going out too much and I was drinking too much.""

Lohan considers herself an expert on rehab facilities.

""I've been court-ordered to do it six times,"" she said. ""I could write the book on rehab. Constantly sending me to rehab is pointless. The first few times I was court-ordered to rehab, it was like a joke, like killing time.""

Morgan interviewed her before the confusion erupted over which rehab facility she would enter. After arriving at one -- which California officials said was unlicensed -- she left for the Betty Ford Clinic, where she spent her last and longest rehab stay.

""I look at it as a good thing,"" she said about this rehab visit. ""I can come back afterwards and be fully focused on work. But I think there are other things I could do instead of going to a rehab center that would benefit me more. The best thing they could do for me would be to make me go abroad to different countries and work with children.""

If she is not a drug user -- she tells Morgan she smoked ""some pot"" a year ago -- or an alcoholic, then why would she need rehab, Morgan asked.

""This is where it gets hard for me to explain,"" she said. ""I don't think there's anything wrong with people taking time to just be by themselves. I think people want to see me do that. They will keep saying the same things about me if I don't. I don't think it will be a bad thing for me to be away with myself for three months.""

Although now confessing to Morgan that she used drugs a year ago, she told Matt Lauer on NBC's ""Today"" show a year ago that that she was ""clean and sober"" then for ""a long time.""

Although she was once arrested for cocaine possession and later sent to rehab when she violated probation by testing positive for the drug, Lohan said she rarely used it since ""I don't like it.""

""It reminds me of my dad,"" she said. ""I took it four times in a period from about the age of 20 to 23, and I got caught twice.""

Cocaine made her feel ""a little too buzzed -- it made me feel uncomfortable,"" she told Morgan.

She's not ""a junkie,"" she said. ""It's the truth. I've never taken heroin either, never injected myself with anything, never done LSD. Those things all scare me.""

Her drugs of choice are ""pot, obviously, and Ecstasy,"" she said. ""I liked that (Ecstasy) better than the others."" Morgan reports Lohan then giggled.

Lohan has previously acknowledged having a drug problem, though. She posted this Twitter message in September 2010 just before entering the Betty Ford Clinic for three months: ""Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn't go away over night. I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps.""

Lohan claimed to Morgan that she's just misunderstood. The constant online tabloid reports of late-night partying, which sometimes results in legal issues, don't show the real person.

""I've never been a junkie, and never will be,"" she said. ""I just like going out late to clubs with friends and listening to music. Always have done. It's not that unusual for girls of 26!""

She slowed down on her drinking on the advice of an actor, Lohan said.

Lohan also talked to Morgan about her sexuality -- she's straight despite a past relationship with a woman. ""I like boys,"" she said.

""I know I'm straight,"" she said. ""I have made out with girls before, and I had a relationship with a girl. But I think I needed to experience that and I think I was looking for something different.""

""I like being in a relationship with a guy,"" Lohan said. ""But there's something just different about it with a woman. When I was with Samantha, I didn't want to leave, because I didn't want to be alone. It was very toxic.""

About her father, Michael Lohan: ""He won't change,"" she said. ""I just think there comes a point where you just kind of have to accept what it is.

""Whenever I do try to bring him back into my life, he creates chaos for me and uses it to his advantage. He's been really good and then really crazy my whole life.""

While she blames the Los Angeles lifestyle for steering her off course, she does point to two Hollywood women who have helped her.

""Meryl Streep was nice,"" Lohan said. ""She just advised me on my acting and what I needed to do differently, and she told me I needed to go back to live with my mum for a while.""

She couldn't move back to New York because at the time, her probation requirements, which including regular drug testing, restricted her to California -- ""the worst possible place I could be,"" she said.

""Jamie Lee Curtis was very kind to me, too,"" she said. ""She also told me to listen to good advice and to get rid of the hangers-on.""

Will you see another story about Lindsay Lohan's substance abuse and legal troubles before she's scheduled to get out of rehab in early August? What could happen in the Betty Ford Clinic, a well-respected refuge for those needing to get their lives back on track?

Lohan was accused of assaulting a Ford staff member during her last stay in December 2010, although the investigation was suspended on December 24 after the staffer drops charges against Lohan.

Just weeks after her release from there, she was again involved in controversy for stealing a necklace from a jewelry store. It was that shoplifting conviction that put her on the road to her current rehab visit.

 Talk:Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona 

Talk:Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona might interest you.  

 Peter III of Aragon 

What is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of Peter over a contemporary coin? Your edits are predominantly changes to lead images, yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. You also reverted my change without even knowing what """"contemporary"""" means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. The reasons to prefer the coin are:
it is a contemporary artefact, giving information about Peter's reign (w/ a caption) and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetime
the coin does not mislead readers about the times of Peter III, as the portrait might
the silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in low-resolution JPG format
it is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate (clean shaven and long-haired) than the greater detail of the imaginary portrait
the later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later, it gives us no information about Peter or his reign, its sole purpose was decorative
what makes the coin an image of Peter is that that is when it was struck and what for, but what makes the later portrait an image of Peter is that somebody labelled it that way—they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other Aragonese king

In your last edit summary, you ask """"if I have to choose between two unreal representations, I prefer the portrait"""", but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer.   

Srnec, the problem is that we have different criteria.

You think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. I think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person, the article is to the information.

I think that a portrait (even if wasn't painted during the live of the person) is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. The two representations have the same chance of not being 100% accurate, but at least one illustrates better than the other.

If not exist any portrait of this person, then I accept a coin's image or a poor drawing. But the present picture accomplish the role and I think that it must be more time.  

I already argued why the coin is a better illustration and you've just asserted the contrary. Do you have an argument? Why are your criteria better than mine?   

Really? When I rebutted all your arguments in your talk page, I stated my reasons. But I do not want another long discussion with you. I offer consensus. Would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century?  
Both of those are improvements over the 17th-century image, but not over the coin. At least one other editor agrees with me.   
Sorry I'm not agree with your second comment, but I hope we have made ​​a step in the right direction. This discussion is already too long. Both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the character's life. Either both seem right.  

 Imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on Wikipedia 

I noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think. You are not allowed to impose your will. Both Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro II of Brazil are Featured Articles. They were reviewed by several editors. Stop with your edit warring.   

Lecen is aware of the three-revert rule. Are you? You've reverted four times on both Pedro I and Pedro II in the last 24 hours. You should undo your last revert and seek dispute resolution, such as discussion on the talk page or a request for comment.",0

2449,"Justin Bieber Vacation: Purpose Tour On Hold After Awards Show Rant? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

It appears that Justin Bieber's Purpose Tour is on hold and Justin is on vacation with friends. Justin definitely needs some time off after slamming awards shows as fake and hollow. The vacation photos started popping up on Justin's Instagram on May 25. Looks as if Justin went camping with an assortment of friends. The singer, who normally writes very little or nothing at all on his social media posts, wrote, ""These are the nights I live for.""

While taking some time off Justin is jet-skiing, maybe doing a little cliff diving and just hanging out. Justin looks pretty relaxed in the photos. On May 27 Justin posted a selfie on Instagram – he appears to be relaxing by the pool with palm trees in the background.

But what's going on with the Purpose Tour? Checking out Justin's website all previous concert dates have been removed. You can't tell for certain if Justin scheduled time off or decided at the last minute to take a vacation because he's burned out.

The first signs that Justin Bieber might need a break came when the singer went on blast telling everyone that just because you buy a CD doesn't mean you are entitled to stop him in the street like he's your bestie. You buy a CD and that's all you're entitled to, a CD, not a piece of Justin.

Next Justin kind of snapped after the Billboard Music Awards saying all these awards shows are all fake, shallow and meaningless. Yet a few days later Justin profusely thanked the Teen Choice Awards for the three nominations he received. Once again, Justin used Instagram to express himself.

The Purpose Tour resumes on June 11 with several stops in Canada and then through the United States through July 19. After two Tokyo shows in August the tour resumes in Europe in September and runs non-stop through the end of November.

A schedule like that might cause any entertainer to put a tour on hold for a couple of weeks. Hopefully Justin will get some much needed R&R and put all the controversy behind him when the tour resumes.

Justin Bieber was spotted out and about in Los Angeles, California on May 27, 2016. He was wearing a sleeve-less red and blue checkered shirt with cut off sweat pants by FameFlynet

2665,"Miley And Liam Fighting? False Rumors Swirl That They're In A Feud Over A Supposed Prenup

Are Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth fighting? A new report claims that Cyrus and Hemsworth had a huge fight over their supposed prenup while they were making their wedding plans.

According to the report, Cyrus, 24, and Hemsworth, 27, have been planning their wedding in the Himalayan Mountains this summer. But there has reportedly been tension between them over having a prenup. Cyrus reportedly told Hemsworth she wanted him to sign a prenup before they got married so she could protect her estimated $200 million net worth. And Hemsworth was reportedly ""shocked and annoyed with Miley and accused her of not trusting him.""

ARE MILEY AND LIAM GETTING MARRIED THIS SUMMER? CLICK HERE FOR DETAILS ...

Sources say Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are fighting over a prenup (Photo: Splash News).

The problem? The report is just not true. Sources told Gossip Cop the there hasn't been any drama between Cyrus and Hemsworth over a prenup. And Cyrus and Hemsworth don't even have any plans to get married in the Himalayan mountains this summer.

But this is far from the first time Cyrus and Hemsworth have faced false rumors about their relationship. They've faced constant breakup, baby, and wedding rumors since they got back together.

IS MILEY AND LIAM'S WEDDING OFF OR ON? UPDATE ...

Just last month, Cyrus and Hemsworth faced rumors they were fighting yet again. This time, sources said that Cyrus and Hemsworth were fighting over whether to live in L.A. or Australia. And sources said they might not get married at all.

Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth don't want to rush into marriage (Photo: XactpiX / Splash News).

But those rumors, like all the other split, pregnancy, and marriage rumors weren't true. Cyrus and Hemsworth are still together and their relationship is doing better than ever. The cute couple even recently went to the beach together while Hemsworth went surfing. So will Cyrus and Hemsworth get married soon?

Sources say that Cyrus and Hemsworth don't want to rush things and make the same mistakes as before now that they're back together. They feel no pressure to get married soon. Instead, they're taking time to build a solid foundation for their relationship.

WHY HAVE MILEY AND LIAM DELAYED THEIR WEDDING? HERE'S THE LATEST ...

""They want to figure out their life together before they get married,"" a source previously told People. ""They're still engaged and living together. They just realized that there is no rush with the wedding and that it's better that they wait a bit.""

2611,"Cher: Ready To Die!

The beat no longer goes on for CHER.

The freaked-out diva has become obsessed with her late ex-husband, Sonny Bono, and believes she’ll join him soon, shocked pals told The National ENQUIRER in a bombshell world exclusive.

“Cher truly believes the end is near for her,” said a family pal. “I’ve never seen anything like it! She’s scaring the hell out of everyone.”

According to the source, the 69-year-old showbiz legend spends most of her time revisiting her past with Sonny, her longtime performing partner who died on Jan. 5, 1998, at the age of 62.

“It’s all about Sonny nowadays,” said the source.

Most disturbing of all, “she’s been paying secret visits to Sonny’s grave and giving away many of her possessions,” added the source.

Sonny and Cher were married from 1964 to 1975, and charted six Top 10 hits, including the classics, “I Got You Babe” and “The Beat Goes On.”

He was killed in a horrible skiing accident in Nevada and is buried near Palm Springs, Calif., where he served as mayor and later was elected to Congress.

“Cher goes to his gravesite with flowers and comes back all weepy and looking like death warmed over,” said the source. “She’s even cried, ‘I’m ready to be with Sonny again.’ ”

As The ENQUIRER reported in April, the Oscar-winning “Moonstruck” star – who is worth a reported $320 million – is suffering from both physical ailments, and the stress of a turbulent personal life.

At the time, she was also dealing with her disastrous D2K concert tour, which was plagued by infighting, lawsuits and medical woes that left a “devastated” Cher canceling 23 shows.

Dealing with her children has also taken a debilitating toll on the “Mask” star, insiders said. Last year Cher forced her estranged son, Elijah Blue Allman, and his new bride to leave her Malibu home, which she believes is haunted by Sonny.

She’s also deeply concerned that her transgendered and outspoken son, Chaz, could be a target by appearing at gay pride rallies.

Meanwhile, the “Believe” singer’s longtime battle with the Epstein–Barr virus has wreaked havoc on her heart and kidneys.

At the time of her first bout with the viral infection – during which she vanished for five months in the early 1990s – Cher told a friend: “This disease makes me feel bone-weary, deeply depressed – and as though all my muscles have turned to Jell-O!”

As The ENQUIRER reported at the time, her publicist told us that doctors had outfitted her with a heart monitor after continuing kidney woes.

When contacted about the specific allegations in this story, her spokesperson Liz Rosenberg told The ENQUIRER that Cher had fully recovered and any claims that she’s headed for an early grave were false and inaccurate.

But recent photographs of a somber Cher on a visit to St. Tropez were telling: She had to be supported by friends who firmly grasped her arms, believing she was close to collapse. “Cher’s been there before and always loved it. But she regrets never having visited with Sonny,” said the source.

“They planned on going a number of times, but something always happened.

“Now, Cher wanted to go with Sonny on her mind. She’s calling it the visit she and Sonny ‘always wanted but never had.’ It’s heartbreaking.”

Despite the trip, the frustrated entertainer has confined herself to her Malibu mansion.

“Cher has a golf cart that she loves,” said one local. “She used to be seen driving [it] around Malibu with a hat and glasses. She would wave to people and chat, but those little rides seem to be a thing of the past.”

Other Malibu sources told The ENQUIRER that Cher seems “very isolated,” while former members of her inner circle are saddened to see her spending her days in bed using a laptop to rant on social media about politics.

“Her management even went to Cher to say she’s got to tone it down, because she’s coming across as angry,” another source said. “But she told them to f–k off.”

Added the friend: “It’s like Cher knows it’s all over, and she’s ready to go. She’s hoping Sonny will be there waiting for her in Heaven.”

She's expecting her third child via surrogate.

But the woman carrying Kim Kardashian's unborn child didn't even know she was carrying the super star's baby.

'She didn't know at the beginning,' Kim, 37, revealed during her appearance on the talk show The Real on Thursday.

Asked if it was even safe to tell the surrogate her identity, Kim said it was possible to go through the process anonymously.

But she said had fears the surrogate may not even be a fan of hers.

'Well you can do it totally anonymously,' Kim replied.  'You could go that route, and I just felt like I wanted, whoever's carrying my baby, like what if they weren't a fan of me or my husband? And what if they didn't want to be carrying our baby?'

Kim said she wanted to develop a relationship with the woman.

'I wanted to give them that choice and be proud and on the same page and I wanted a relationship with her.'

Luckily Kim's surrogate was delighted to learn whose child she was carrying, and was 'proud' to do so, knowing the complications she suffered from during her previous pregnancies.

'She was really excited! She was someone that had watched the show, not like a super fan or anything that it would have been uncomfortable, but she had seen my struggle and seen how open I was about it. So she was really proud to do it, really excited,' Kim said.

Kim recently threw herself a baby shower, though explained she didn't invite the surrogate.

'I, um, I did not [invite her]. I did introduce her to my family. I introduced her to my family earlier that day. And, you know, I just thought, I don’t know, it was like a weird decision to have to make,' said the KUWTK star.

'I think I have to explain it to my kids first and figure out how I’m going to explain it to them.'

Kim insisted there are no ill feelings.

'I love her. I have the best relationship with my surrogate. She’s so nice. She is the perfect person to do this for my family. She’s great. She’s been amazing.'

Kim and her husband Kanye West also have daughter North, four, and son Saint, one.

2784,"Kim Kardashian explains why she won’t be voting for Trump after all

For a moment there, it seemed that Hillary Clinton had lost the Kim Kardashian vote.

The reality TV star backed Clinton as early as August 2015 and, in typical Kim Kardashian fashion, had declared her allegiance via selfie.

But last week, reports emerged that Kardashian was thinking of voting for Donald Trump after Caitlyn Jenner — a Republican who spoke during the party’s convention this summer — encouraged her to reconsider her vote.

It all stemmed from a Kardashian quote attributed to an upcoming Wonderland magazine cover story. The quote does not appear in the online version of the magazine, but BuzzFeed reports that it did appear in an advance version sent to certain outlets, including to BuzzFeed UK.

The reported quote read: “At first I thought, ‘Oh my god, I’m so Hillary [Clinton],’ but I had a long political call with Caitlyn [Jenner] last night about why she’s voting Trump. I’m on the fence.”

Headlines declared “Kim Kardashian Is Suddenly (And Disappointingly) Considering Voting For Donald Trump,” “Caitlyn Jenner Convinces Kim Kardashian to Consider Trump” and “Hillary Clinton Supporter Kim Kardashian Might Vote for Donald Trump.”

And, according to Kardashian, her phone blew up with messages from family, friends and both candidates’ camps. So she took to her website Saturday night and explained why she was “‘on the fence’ about my vote,” she wrote.

[Master of horror fiction Stephen King says ‘Trump presidency scares me to death’]

“There was a point when I wasn’t 100% sure I was even going to vote in this election; I didn’t want to vote blindly,” she wrote. “But I also thought about how not voting would mean that I wasn’t making my voice heard, so I decided to talk to my closest friends and family who I love and trust, to have an open conversation about politics.”

She spoke with Jenner, who encouraged her “to do my research before making my decision and then vote for the candidate whose policies aligned with the things that matter most to me.” For Kardashian, that included “gun control and protecting women’s rights to safe and legal abortion.”

Kardashian continued: “I found that without a doubt, I stand with Hillary. I’m with her. I believe Hillary will best represent our country and is the most qualified for the job. This year, I’m not just voting for myself, but also for my children, and I took that into careful consideration when I made my decision.”

She also wrote that she believed both Clinton and Trump “have the intention of making the country a safer and stronger place for every American.”

Jenner, for her part, has made varying statements about Trump and Clinton. In a March episode of her show, “I Am Cait,” she said she was not a Trump fan because of “his macho attitude” but would “never ever ever vote for Hillary. We’re done, if Hillary becomes president. The country is over.”

But in August, Jenner told HBO’s Bill Simmons, “I honestly have not outwardly supported anybody.”

Kim Kardashian: ‘I want my children to grow up knowing that their lives matter.’

2817,"The Queen 'will not step aside for Prince Charles', sources say

The Queen has no intention of stepping aside for Prince Charles and remains committed to her duty to the nation, it has been reported.

The 91-year-old sovereign is the world's longest-reigning living monarch but as she pledged on her 21st birthday, she insists on serving the country for her whole life.

But despite speculation she may step aside to let Prince Charles take the throne, royal insiders told The Sunday Times the Queen had stated ""duty first, nation first, I'm going to be there"".

Three separate senior sources have dismissed claims she will request the Regency Act, which allows the monarch to cede power to the heir and see a regent carrying out certain royal functions and duties on behalf of the sovereign.

For the Act to be requested, the monarch has to be officially declared incapable of performing royal functions by the lord chancellor, the Speaker of the House of Commons and the master of rolls.

But the sources have quashed rumours the Queen would step aside if she was still on the throne in four years time.

One source told the newspaper the Queen had always been vehement that she would not call for a regency, adding: ""As long as she's healthy, regardless of her age, I don't see a regency. Other members of the royal family can just do more.""

In recent years, she has reduced the number of public engagements she attends but continues to carry out her functions on state matters.

She no longer makes long haul overseas trips and other members of the royal family have been undertaking foreign tours and official state visits in her name.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Kate, for example caught the world's attention during the Diamond Jubilee Tour on behalf of the Queen in September 2012.

There have also been discussions about the possibility of the crown ""leapfrogging"" Prince Charles in favour of his son Prince William.

But this has been dismissed since it would cause a constitutional crisis, with Prince William previously saying there was ""no question"" of it happening.

Speaking in 2012 about his future on the throne, Prince Charles, 68, said: ""Impatient? Me? What a thing to suggest! Yes of course I am. I'll run out of time soon. I shall have snuffled it if I'm not careful"".

Keen to engage in public life, Prince Charles has depicted himself as a champion of environmental issues.

2622,"Kris Jenner is planning a 'revenge memoir'

Caitlyn Jenner recently released her memoir The Secrets of My Life which she has said is about her “journey” but has also been a scathing attack on her ex, Kris.

The 67-year-old has made some outrageous claims in her memoir about Kris knowing all along about her wanting to transition to a woman and even accused the momager of keeping money from her.

Caitlyn also recently revealed to The Sunday Times she was “never comfortable” having sex with Kris during their 23-year marriage. Ouch!

Well, what goes around comes back around as Kris is said to be writing a “revenge memoir” on Cait.

According to NW magazine the Kardashian matriarch wants to tell her own side of the story and is planning to revamp her 2011 book, Kris Jenner...And All Things Kardashian, which will reveal a few secrets of her own.

A source told the publication: “Kris despises Caitlyn and wants to destroy her with all the embarrassing photos she can find and revelations she can think of.”

“She’s held back stuff about the controlling ways Cait displayed as Bruce, as well as her angry incidents and bizarre fetishes,” the source continued.

 Philosopher RFC 
philosopher (from Wiktionary): A person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy.

I am going to make the case that we must call Stefan Molyneux a """"philosopher"""" (without qualifiers) in the lead.  This is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy, only that it is his career. (Note: Not all of the sources I use below are in the article at present. The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that """"philosopher"""" is accurate and widely accepted, then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place.)

 Definitions 
Obviously, each source is going to use slightly different phrasing. Some will call him explicitly a """"philosopher"""" or has views on """"philosophy"""", but I think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent. Using one word """"philosopher"""" in the lead sentence covers all of his political, ethical, and theistic specializations in one word, which we then elaborate on later in the article.

 """"philosophical conversation"""", """"philosophy show"""" - used to describe his Freedomain Radio series
 """"libertarian"""", """"libertarian thinker"""" - """"Libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies ...""""
 """"anarcho-capitalist"""" - """"Anarcho-capitalism ... is a political philosophy...""""
 """"voluntaryist"""" - """"Voluntaryism (or sometimes voluntarism), is a libertarian philosophy...""""
 """"athiest"""" - """"Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches.""""
 """"ethics- """"Ethics, sometimes known as philosophical ethics, ethical theory, moral theory, and moral philosophy, is a branch of philosophy""""
 """"Secular ethics- """"Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy...""""

 Primary source 
As Stefan Molyneux is a living person, we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him (obviously, we don't want to host any sort of """"fringe"""" claims). If we are to dispute what he says about himself, though, then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this, or we open Wikipedia to discredit or liability - this is why BLPs are held to strong standards in the first place. I think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct. He is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media, which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the """"old-school"""" philosophers we're used to.

 Freedomain Radio """"About"""" page - """"my Master's Thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies """", """"I have been fascinated by philosophy - particularly moral theories - since my mid-teens. I left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at Freedomain Radio. I have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy.""""
 Freedomain Radio (the show that Molyneux hosts) has the tagline """"The Largest and Most Popular Philosophical Conversation in the World""""* 
 Molyneux's books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy, particularly Universally Preferable Behaviour (UPB): A Rational Proof of Secular Ethics and Against the Gods? A Concise Guide to Atheism and Agnosticism which are two of his more """"deep dives"""" into the fundamental philosophies.

2457,"Kanye West: If He's Not North's Father, Which Of Kim Kardashian's Exes Is?

OMG! We can't imagine Kanye West, 38, not being the bio dad for precious daughter North, two, but according to a new report, he's not real her father, so who is? Kim Kardashian, 35, has had several famous exes she could have turned to when she wanted to have a child, and since she froze her eggs, she may have asked one of them to become a baby daddy. Let's take a look at who the candidates could be!

According to a cover story in Star magazine, Kim froze her eggs in 2012 when she was worried about her ticking biological clock, and had an ex fertilize one before she got with Kanye. ""There'd been buzz that Kim had frozen some embryos, which she'd created with an ex-boyfriend's sperm, so she could have a baby when she was ready.""

So who could the daddy be? We know Kim always deeply loved Reggie Bush, 31, as they dated on and off for three years, from 2007 – 2010. And he sure is handsome and would make beautiful babies! North's daddy definitely is a man of color so the NFL star could be a candidate.

Her most recent ex would have been Kris Humphries, 31, who Kim was infamously married to for 72 days in 2011. While their union ended on bitter terms, could she have still turned to him to help father a baby? After all, they still weren't divorced when Kim became pregnant shortly after she started dating Kanye. And what about her sex tape partner Ray J, 35? Could Kim have asked him for a daddy favor?

Stream music, completely unlimited and ad-free, RIGHT HERE

Star's report claims that Kanye wasn't as eager about having kids as Kim was. ""When Kanye refused to back down, Kim may have had one of the embryos implanted,"" their source said. ""She didn't have time to wait for Kanye,"" the magazine claims.

""People are speculating that Kim tricked Kanye into believing they conceived in Italy so he wouldn't figure out the real story, that she'd already been implanted with an embryo that had another man's DNA!"" according to their story.

While neither Kim or Kanye has commented yet, this story is pretty unbelievable. North looks like an absolutely perfect genetic combination of Kim and Kanye that simply cannot be denied!

Check out Kim's book, Selfish, right now on Amazon.

HollywoodLifers, do you think there's any chance that North isn't Kanye's biological daughter?

2728,"Heidi Klum and Seal Have a Friendly Reunion at Billboard Music Awards 2016

Heidi Klum and Seal were the epitome of friendly exes at the 2016 Billboard Music Awar Sunday night.

The former couple, who divorced four years ago after seven years of marriage, were spotted chatting with a mutual friend during a commercial break. Klum, 42, and Seal, 53, were all smiles while they caught up with each other. Klum and Seal share three children together, Henry, 10, and Johan, 9, and daughter Lou, 6. Seal also adopted Klum's daughter Leni, 11, while they were married.

Both the supermodel and the British singer have moved on in their personal lives, as Klum has dated Vito Schnabel since 2014 and Seal has been linked to Erica Packer. Packer, who was previously married to James Packer, opened up to Australia's Today show a couple of months ago and gushed about her relationship with the ""Kissed by a Rose"" singer.

""I'm very happy,"" she said. ""It's an incredibly happy time in my life and he's a very beautiful and magical soul and I feel lucky to have met him.""

Meanwhile on the BBMAs red carpet, the Project Runway host opened up about her boyfriend to E! News' Jason Kennedy that she's ""very much in love.""

""How do you know when it is? You just feel it, and then you know,"" Klum said of her romance with the art dealer. ""Is there something that you can pinpoint on someone? It's just a whole package that you fall in love with, right?""

Unfortunately, Schnabel couldn't attend the awards show Sunday because he was in New York, so Klum walked the red carpet solo. Earlier in the evening Seal, who presented Céline Dion with the Icon award, walked the red carpet, too.

Her ""Soul Food Sundays"" have gotten the approval of her husband Kanye West, friends Chrissy Teigen and John Legend, and everyone in between - and now, a source tells People that their encouragement has led her to want to write her own cookbook.

""Kim is starting to cook so much more than she has in her entire life,"" the source said. ""She's actually considering a cookbook, and she's pretty serious about it. It all started with Kanye's encouragement as he loved when she cooks him food.""

The source told People that Kim has been ""testing the waters"" to see if her fans would be interested in the cookbook by posting more food content to social media. So far, the response has been overwhelmingly positive, and she's even started consulting with Chrissy - who recently published her own cookbook, Cravings - for tips and recipes.

2650,"Victoria Beckham's big fashion guide: Posh Spice to write book telling Brits how to dress

Posh is set to release the book next year to mark 10 years in the fashion business. The Spice Girl-turned-designer is said to have teamed up with US Vogue editor Anna Wintour. The pair have become close friends in recent years, with Wintour said to be the driving force behind the guide.

“Victoria has started work on a style bible, and Anna is the one who encouraged her to do it” It provides tips on style, and lifts the lid on Victoria’s life in fashion in a deal that could make millions for Brand Beckham. A source said: “Victoria has started work on a style bible, and Anna is the one who encouraged her to do it. ""Anna saw an opportunity and pushed Vic to do this, offering to help in any way she can. “The new book will be full of new details about her life in fashion and everything she has learned up until now.”

2485,"Ellen, Portia cancel appearance after 'epic' fight

Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi didn't show up at a charity fund-raiser for rescued animals after having a huge fight in the car on the way to Sunday's event, sources tell Page Six.

The power couple was on the way to the Saving SPOT! fund-raiser at Tiato in Santa Monica when they got into an argument and turned around without attending the event, even though they were listed and pictured on the invitation as hosts. Ellen and Portia on Monday insisted to Page Six they had informed the charity they would be unable to make it and their picture should not have been on the invitation.

A source told us: ""Ellen and Portia were supposed to be at the event at 5 p.m., but at 6:30 p.m., the media was still waiting for their arrival. Reporters were told they were on their way, until the head of the charity informed everyone at the end of the event that they weren't going to make it due to 'logistics.'""

The source added, ""Ellen and Portia were delayed and were in the car on the way, when they had an epic fight. They ended up turning around and not going to the fund-raiser.""

Saving SPOT! is a nonprofit dedicated to rescuing dogs and providing them with caring owners. Ellen and Portia attended last year's benefit in Beverly Hills and had been happy to be listed as hosts for this year's event, we're told.

Ellen - a generous animal-welfare supporter - and Portia said in a statement to Page Six: ""We were happy to lend our names as honorary chairs and the organization was always aware that we would be unable to attend. This is the first time we have seen our images attached to the invite. It was not approved and it is misleading.""

DeGeneres' attorney Marty Singer said, ""The story is a complete lie. My client told the organizer they never agreed nor planned to attend the event. There was no fight that caused them not to attend."" The charity didn't respond to requests for comment.

Ellen recently slammed divorce rumors and reports of arguments on the season premiere of her talk show. ""I had a great summer,"" she said in September. ""I went on a trip with Portia, my beautiful wife - who I am happily married to, but thank you for your heartfelt concern, tabloids.""

2643,"Prince William and Kate Middleton Moving Out Of Kensington Palace? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Prince William and Kate Middleton are already thinking about moving out of Kensington Palace. That’s because William doesn’t want his children Prince George and Princess Charlotte to grow up behind palace walls. Instead, he wants them to live a life out of the spotlight and as far away from the paparazzi as possible.

In his interview with British GQ, Prince William said that the most important thing for him is knowing that Prince George and Princess Charlotte will grow up in a happy, stable secure world.

In other words, he doesn’t want his kids to experience the same royal hustle and bustle that he had while growing up behind closed doors. And while Prince William and Kate Middleton haven’t fully moved in to Kensington Palace just yet, they are already thinking about their next move. Apparently, London is the last place that William wants to be with Kate and their kids.

Of course, if Prince William and Kate Middleton do end up moving from Kensington Palace, royal observers wouldn’t be surprised. It’s taken them this long to move back to London after having spent the last several years at Anmer Hall. Prince William has made it no secret that he doesn’t want his children to have the same childhood he had while growing up.

Ideally, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would love to move back to Anmer Hall. It was a gift given to them by Queen Elizabeth. The property boasts a swimming pool and private tennis court and enough room for Prince George and Princess Charlotte to run around in all day and night.

But of course for Prince William this won’t be easy. He can try and live a private life as much as he wants to, but at the same time he is the future King of England. Prince George and Princess Charlotte are going to be in the spotlight whether he likes it or not. And as much as he would love to return to Anmer Hall in the future, it might not happen.

All of his royal responsibilities and engagements are in London. That’s why many royal fans believe that sooner or later William will just have to suck up his feelings and do the job he was born to do.

In the meantime, don’t forget to check back with CDL for all the latest news and updates on the royal family right here!

2841,"Nicole Kidman Charmingly Bungles Through a Comment on Her Alexander Skarsgård Kiss at the Emmys

Ah, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. She, an Australian film fixture once married to Hollywood’s leading man. He, an Australian country singer with a Nashville heart. Together they are a bi-coastal, bi-country, bi-continent power couple. Go on, watch them walk down any red carpet together and try to remain uncharmed. They’re two charm factories who make distinctive hair choices! You have no chance! That’s why when she won best actress for her electric Big Little Lies role, and kissed her television husband, the very tall Alexander Skarsgård, on the lips while her actual husband looked lovingly on, everyone was like, “What? Huh? On the lips?”

Finally, we have some answers. Sort of. Well, Graham Norton of Britain’s Graham Norton Show tried to get some answers, while Kidman sat next to her Killing of a Sacred Deer co-star Colin Farrell, who was next to Bryan Cranston, who was next to Matt Lucas. He didn’t get answers, per se, but he did get some TV magic.

“I kissed my husband too,” was her first tactic. And then, she said, “I did kiss him because— but you gotta understand, I did everything with Alex,"" Nicole said.

“Alright I’m backin’ off,” Kidman said. “I’ve got an amazing, supportive, gorgeous husband who I love more than anything in the world and I gave Alex a congratulatory kiss and he’s like a mannequin.”

The clip is charming. Kidman’s charming. She, one of the most beautiful and accomplished women in the world, can’t say the right thing no matter how hard she tries. She’s awash is embarrassment, but also it feels so safe because the couple—Kidman and Urban, that is—appears to have so much love that that love bubbles up and over, turning an innocent congratulations into a kiss on the lips. There’s enough to go around, it would seem.

This year, Kidman has developed a habit of doing a small thing at an award show that becomes a much bigger phenomenon on the Internet that night and the following day, and, in the case of the Skarsgård kiss, the subsequent weeks. She’s a one-woman meme machine, and who could have seen that coming? Who could have thought that in 2017, Nicole Kidman would be the one bringing unintentional levity to long award shows? Anyone?

One of those small things was just being cute on the Cannes red carpet with her husband. (He whispered something, but we’ll never know what it is. It’s Lost in Translation 2: Still a Little Lost!) Another time she clapped like a seal at the Oscars. (It was a strategy, she explained, for showing appreciation while also protecting the diamonds.) We’ll have to wait and see what kind of nominations Kidman racks up for the imminent awards season, but we can only hope the people in charge of seating charts place her firmly in front of a camera. She’s a proven star in this new ad-hoc people’s choice category.

I find the balance of content in this article extremely unsatisfactory.  To introduce Badoglio's career by saying he """"was an Italian soldier, politician and alleged war criminal for the use of poison gas and systematically bombarding and strafing Red Cross hospitals and ambulances during the Ethiopia campaign. Due to post-war expediencies, however, he was never brought to justice"""" seems to miss several points entirely.  That's 5 words about his military and political career, and 36 about his activities as a war criminal.  The war criminal accusation is based entirely on one documentary source which is very short on facts and evidence.  If this war criminal accusation is true, it needs to be strengthened with names, dates and places, and some evidence of Badoglio's involvement in the events.  

It seems to me far more important to stress the facts that Badoglio was one of Italy's most senior military figures during the Second World War, despite his doubts about Italy's strategic capabilities, and that he became Prime Minister after the downfall of Mussolini.  Badoglio's role in the inexplicable two months delay between July and September 1943, when Italy's future role in the war remained ambivalent while Germany rushed troops south to fortify the Italian peninsula, is the most fascinating thing about his career.  Whatever the reasons for his failure to act decisively, Badoglio's inaction condemned Italy to suffer another twenty months of grinding war.  This article in its present form barely mentions those events.

2478,"Did Charlize Theron Break Keanu Reeves' Heart By Dating Sean Penn?

Charlize Theron may have broken Keanu Reeves' tender heart by hooking up with fellow thespian Sean Penn.

The Monster star and the Gangster Squad alum were reportedly spotted together on a beach not too long ago, fueling rumors that the pair were starting to get romantic. Adding fuel to the flames of speculations were photos of Theron snuggling up to Penn at a pre-Oscar party over the weekend.

Check out Charlize Theron and Sean Penn hanging out at Pharrell Williams' shindig below. Chances are their appearance at the gathering will only cause rumors of their rumored romance to spiral completely out of control.

Since Charlize Theron has reportedly found a boyfriend, a close ""friend"" told the folks over at OK! magazine that Keanu Reeves isn't exactly thrilled with the situation. Since he and Theron had an on-again off-again relationship for years, the 47 Ronin star is apparently a little depressed.

""To see her falling in love with Sean is really hurting him. Charlize and Keanu have been secretly on-and-off for so long. I think he thought they would eventually end up together for good. He's a little heartbroken,"" the insider dished to the publication.

Of course, Charlize Theron's new romance doesn't come without its own set of unique problems. According to Star, yet another anonymous source believes that the actress's mom is very worried that Penn could up and leave at any moment. It goes without saying that no one should take this information as gospel.

""The South African native if fearful that womanizing Sean will break her daughter's heart. While the protective mama bear has never minded their friendship, sources say she 'begged Charlize not to let it turn romantic,'"" the insider said.

If you're more concerned with Theron's career than her private life, then you definitely have a few projects headed to your neighborhood multiplex in the next few years. Not only does she appear in Ted director Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West, Charlize also plays a significant role in the highly-anticipated sci-fi flick Mad Max: Fury Road.

What do you think about Charlize Theron possibly dating actor Sean Penn? Do you think there's any truth to the rumors regarding Keanu Reeves' broken heart?

2898,"Ellen DeGeneres Talks Feelings, Fun and Finding Dory

Ellen DeGeneres is a lot like the cartoon fish she gives life to in Disney/Pixar’s Finding Dory, opening June 17. Much like Dory, whom we met in the hit 2003 movie Finding Nemo, DeGeneres, 58, is undaunted, kind, strong and loving, swimming on despite the obstacles in her way. But unlike Dory, whose amnesia causes her to remember almost nothing, DeGeneres remembers a whole lot.

The native of Metairie, Louisiana, hasn’t forgotten the slow road to fame in the 1990s and how her first prime-time comedy series, Ellen, was abandoned by advertisers and the TV network when it flopped, capsized in part by backlash and negative response to her “coming out” as TV’s highest-profile lesbian. Like Dory, she swam on. She went back to doing stand-up comedy, created her own afternoon-TV talk show and hosted the Emmys, Grammys and the Academy Awards—twice.

In 2008, DeGeneres married Australian actress/model Portia de Rossi, 43. Both vegans, they share a passion for animal rights, environmental causes and renovating houses. Parade’s Dotson Rader met with DeGeneres in her office on the back lot of the TV studio complex in Burbank, California, where The Ellen DeGeneres Show has been produced for 13 years.

What was your childhood like? Was it fun?

I grew up in a very conservative home. My father was a first reader in the Christian Science Church, which is similar to being a preacher. There was no drinking, smoking or cursing. I didn’t see deep emotion from my parents. It was all very polite and very surface. I never knew how anybody was feeling. Because of that religion everything was fine all the time.

Isn’t it dishonest to pretend you’re happy when you’re really angry?

Exactly. I never saw anyone angry—so when I was 13 and my parents divorced it was a huge surprise to me because I was told everything was fine. It was very confusing. That’s not a healthy way to grow up. It was very hard to express yourself. A kid should be told that you can have feelings. I have a lot of feelings. You can feel sad and angry and hurt. But the only feeling that was approved of is happiness—that was it. How can you have happiness when you’re not honest?

How did that emotional repression affect you?

As a young girl, I noticed things a lot more. I started seeing that things weren’t completely as everyone said they were. I noticed everything because I had to after my parents divorced. At 13, I sort of became the parent, taking care of my mother.

Did that experience influence your comedy?

I think my comedy came from observing little details in life. What is most important are the details, not the broad strokes but noticing what’s in between. One of my first jokes was the fact that when somebody tastes something disgusting, they always want you to taste it too, like, “This is disgusting—taste it!” And people do.

Why could you see what others never saw?

Because I was very tender. I was very sensitive, and I still am. I never want to hurt anybody. I want to make people laugh. I didn’t think it was ever funny to make fun of people. There’s so much to laugh at without it being at someone else’s expense.

You end each TV show by telling your viewers to be kind to each other. Why is kindness so important to you?

Because I’ve been treated in a way that has not been kind, respectful or considerate. I learned compassion from having experienced some bad stuff.

After your parents divorced, you stayed alone with your mom in New Orleans?

Yes. My mother was going through a hard time. She dated lots of really horrible men and had bad experiences. She went from being my mother to being somebody I was watching date men. At 13, it’s a weird thing. Then she remarried and had breast cancer right away, a really tough thing for her. I had to make her laugh. [My comedy] started from me trying to make her happy. It felt really good to have power to make people happy. That’s my talent. Not that I thought I’d make money from it.

You have an older brother, Vance. What happened to him?

He left, angry. He was 17. He didn’t want to live with either parent. He was in a band. Now we’re very, very close. He’s great. He is very talented and works with my production company.

You went to the University of New Orleans for less than a semester and dropped out. Why?

School just was not interesting to me.

Before Ellen was Ellen: Do You Remember Her 10 Best TV Appearances?

Were you surprised when ABC abruptly canceled your hit sitcom after your character came out?

It was a sucker punch. I didn’t expect it. I knew that there was a big chance that this was the end of my career. But I’m grateful for it. I got to start over again and create this talk show. There are people who don’t know about the sitcoms, or my stand-up comedy. They think I’m just a talk show host. That’s fine with me.

On your talk show, everything is positive, despite what may be happening that’s bad in the real world, say in politics.

I don’t do political humor. I never have. Trump is being attacked by everybody because it’s an easy thing to do. Stephen Colbert goes after him every night and so does Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel. A lot of people do. I don’t. I don’t want to make fun of anybody. It’s not who I am.

Get a Peek at Ellen’s Quirky Design Style in Her New Book Home

Your show seems unrelentingly happy. It is a happy show, on purpose. I represent happiness to a lot of people. I want to keep myself as open and as nonjudgmental as possible. Before the show was picked up, I think a lot of station managers thought I would have an agenda to try to somehow turn the world gay. People did worry. Our only agenda is to make people feel good. It’s an hour of joy.

Your audience squeals with excited delight a lot. There are people from all over the world who wait three years for tickets. I was in Dubai and this woman said she’d been trying to get tickets for five years. That’s why I created the room [for] leftover people who can’t get in. Tom Hanks named it the Riff Raff Room.

You live a very public life with a lot of pressures, among them rumors of marital problems with your wife, Portia. I don’t pay attention [to rumors]. But we’ve been followed recently by the paparazzi, and we found out it’s because there’s a story out there that we’re getting divorced. We don’t know why. We’re together all the time. We genuinely love each other. Her happiness is my happiness, and vice versa. True love is caring more about the other person’s happiness than your own.

2188,"""I'm sorry you are wrong on both counts. Northumbrian is a different dialect to Geordie as you have said. The other dialects from the area are Makem and Pitmatic. Northumbrian being the accent that is common in the larger part of 'Northumberland'. I being from Northumberland myself actually know what I am talking about. If you live in rural Northumberland, bearing in mind that the shire (as Northumberland is a shire county) is mostly rural, you would have a different dialect to someone from Newcastle, Prudhoe, or Gateshead, as the inhabitants of these places generally speak with a Geordie accent. Also no serious linguist would call all these *different* dialects Geordie. I have heard them grouped as Northumbrian dialects but not Geordie dialects. Calling them Northumbrian is correct for two reasons, one being that all these dialects come from the area that is known as Northumbria (That is Northumberland, Durham, Newcastle...etc..).

On the other point you are mistake. England (though not the whole UK) can be (rightly) called a Germanic nation. It is true blood is not the deciding factor as you say (though it is connected in some ways), however traditions, language, laws and history are! England was of course founded by...you guessed it Germanic tribes (whether they are the predominant DNA is besides the point. These tribes were the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. You can't deny this as before the English kingdoms, England did not exist. Our language is obviously Germanic (though it has borrowed from other languages over the centuries, it is still West Germanic). Most of our common traditions, such as Yule (Yule itself is a Germanic Word, derived from the Norse Jul) are Germanic, the eating of a Christmas Ham, Mistletoe, Christmas trees, Yule Logs...etc…are all Germanic. Many of our laws come direct from Anglo-Saxon and Danish laws, though I agree many were modified by the Normans, who though descended from Norwegians are not culturally Germanic.
As for self-identity, I would say that the English identify themselves with Germanic culture, albeit in a subliminal way, for example the fact that they use Anglo-Saxon to describe themselves is an indication of this. They are identifying with tribes that were Danish and Northern German and thus Germanic so on that score yes the English are a Germanic people.

And as you bring up DNA casually, then firstly I will point out that it isn't proven either way whether the Anglo-Saxon DNA is more prominent or whether the British (used in this sense as pre-Anglo-Saxon) is. Different surveys have different results, and none have actually been accepted by all experts. And for the most part many of the newer surveys still show that in the North East of England the Germanic percentage is higher than the British (thus the predominant DNA is Germanic), the main problem is that it cannot be determined whether it is Anglo-Saxon or Danish """"Viking"""" blood, but this does not make any difference to whether the blood is Germanic. I don't care whether the Modern English have British or Anglo-Saxon blood as I am partly Norse-Gaelic and partly 'English'...thus being a mix. I just do think that the Anglo-Saxon blood is prominent as do many experts, in North Eastern England.

Either way Germanic Blood or British Blood...the English are ethnically Germanic.

Note: I am not going to lie and say I am not proud of Germanic Culture as it is obvious (especially by my username), but I do consider myself British as the UK isn't about one ethnicity or culture but about the union of many and I am proud of that also. And by the way there is a good case for Northumbria being one of the more Germanic parts, due in a large part to it's folklore especially it's creatures, that include Dvergar (Which they are actually called...they are Dwarves) and Álfar or more correctly Ælfe (as they are in Old English), who are known by the common English word Elf, but are the older and if I may say more correct type.

2533,"Kim Kardashian displays shocking hair loss after 'relying on weaves'

She's left fans green with envy thanks to her incredible post-pregnancy weight loss. 



But it seems that Kim Kardashian's rush to regain her svelte frame has had an unwanted effect on her hair. 



Images of the 33-year-old with her hair tied up in a high bun while out in Los Angeles last week show the extent of what appears to be extreme hair loss, which the reality star seems to have been attempting to cover up with weaves and hair extensions.

And according to hair extension expert Tatiana Karelina, it could be Kim's rapid weight loss that triggered her hair loss. 



Tatiana told MailOnline: 'It is well known that during the later stage of pregnancy you lose less hair due to hormones, making it thicker and lusher, but when you have the baby most women find they  seem to be losing a lot more hair than normal.

'What with the rapid amount of weight Kim lost and dieting in the months after the birth, this may have accelerated the hair loss, giving sparser looking patches, we can clearly see how thin her hair is around the hairline. 



Thinning out: Hair extension expert Tatiana Karelina told MailOnline that Kim's rapid post-pregnancy weight loss could have contributed to her thinning locks

 Where the real ends and the fake begins: The line of Kim's extensions could clearly be seen During pregnancy: Kim showed no signs of any hair loss as she was pictured with her hair scraped back into a ponytail back last May 'Birth and rapid weightloss are both factors that have triggered her thinning hair and made her opt for hair extensions to boost her diminished hair volume.' Tatiana added that Kim's apparent reliance on hair extensions to give her boosted locks have now left her with Traction Alopecia, and that she should have the weaves removed as soon as possible if she doesn't want to damage her hair further. 

 She told MailOnline: 'In spite of giving instant full thick hair, weaves put extreme pressure on the hair and scalp, often too heavy and tight, the pulling and weight often cause severe migraines and Traction Alopecia, and actually aid hair loss rather than help to recover healthy hair regrowth. Top knot trouble: Kim displayed the hair loss as she wore her hair up in a high bun while out in Los Angeles last week



'I would not recommend that Kim keep the weave in her hair, but rather opt for lighter non damaging types of extensions, or a simple clip-in that can be taken out often to relieve pressure on hair follicles and the scalp.'

Kim isn't the only star to have suffered after relying on extensions and weaves.

Rihanna and Naomi Campbell are among the other famous faces to have found themselves with damaged hair after boosting their barnets with extensions.

2500,"'Fifty Shades Darker' Update: Jamie Dornan, Dakota Johnson split after feuding on set; Film's release delayed?

Fifty Shades Darker may now be in trouble with reported feuding between cast members Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson.

Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are'nt in good terms and the movie's sequel, Fifty Shades Freed is facing cancellation threats.  According to Chattsports,  Dornan is busy with a new movie.

Excited fans are disappointed that the sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey might be postponed to a later date. According to the reporte, Dornan was furious with Johnson's actions on set. However, there is no reported information on what the actual reason was. The article reportedly stated that the feud started during the filming of the movie.

It is claimed that the sequel's release date could actually be in trouble since there is a lot of tension between the actors. As reported by Australian Network News, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson reportedly have a great chemistry on screen and hence, they were rumoured to have an affair. But both of them have never confirmed the status of their real life relationship.

The main reason for their reported split is because of Jamie Dornan's new movie, Untogether. Now because of this tension, even reports now say that the release date of Fifty Shades Darker has been affected.

Meanwhile, Untogether will reportedly feature the life of a drug addict, and Dornan will play the role of a writer. The production team reportedly did not confirm anything yet and the rumours were debunked because of lack of factual details. The contraditing reports come that fans are looking forward to the sequel release on february 2017.

Jamie Dornan reportedly wants to focus on his family after the busy days of shoot and be home with his wife, Amelia Warner. He reportedly admitted to missing his family amid linking him endlessly with onscreen partner Dakota Johnson.

1468,"""I'm back. I already created  ID (occasionally forget to log in but you can see the same class C when I do) I collected a massive number of diff edits on Balkanfever who pretends to be neutral but is  on record] getting blocked for saying this about Greeks under a previous handle. (not to mention his personal talk page is one big anti-Greek rant fest pointing to questionable FYROM news sources with highly exaggerated sensationalist titles)

""""No, Assfuckers (has a nice ring to it D) use it as a pejorative term. 

I was ready to pull the trigger on both him, admin Futper, and a few others (e.g. Macedoniaboy who says he is a """"proud fighter for united Macedonia on his talk page) with a detailed complaint about anti-Greek propaganda but since Futper managed a civil discussion with me and now seems to be sticking to debating articles (rather than threats of blocking)  I'm going to avoid escalating this further for now. ns. 

As for the current naming disputing article... I agree with you that some FYROM citizens honestly believe their claims but I don't think that reduces the existential threat to Greece. Communism fell 17 years ago in Yugoslavia and the FYROM government appears to be getting worse not better (imagine if in two hundred years they call themselves """"ethnic Athenians"""" and the cycle continues until their is no Greece left). 

There appear to be important quotes missing from the naming dispute article that clearly demonstrate that FYROM leadership are confused about their own national identity (and confusing their own citizens in the process unfortunately). I tried to add this to the talk page of the article but Futper deleted it (arguing ancient Macedon is unrelated to the article even though his own editing history shows him adding an edit arguing that ancient Macedon wasn't Greek) I didn't want to get into a revert war over simply a discussion of perceived facts but since I didn't think those facts should be censored either I thought perhaps you could add them to discussion on the naming dispute talk page. (assuming you see it as relevant yourself of course)

February 26, 1992: The FYROM's President Kirov Gligorov, at an interview by the Foreign Information Service daily report, Easten Europe, stated: '""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.'

""""January 22, 1999: The FYROM's Ambassador in Washington D.C., Mrs. Ljubica Acevska, gave a speech on the present situation in the Balkans, she stated: '""""We do not claim to be descendants of Alexander the Great. We are Slavs and we speak a Slavic language. Greece is The FYROM's second largest trading partner and its number one """"investor.""""'

February 24, 1999: The FYROM.'s Ambassador to Canada, Gyordan Veselinov, in an interview with the """"Ottawa Citizen"""", he admitted: '""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are Slavs and our language is closely related to Bulgarian. There is some confusion about our identity.""""'

I think the above needs to be compared to that of their current hard line prime minister's recent behavior. He directly contradicts FYROM's own government's previous comments about themselves (that apparently was unauthentically meant to assure foreigners that Greeks were imagining FYROM propaganda and to reduce the issue to a childish dispute over simply names.. in order to get recognition)

Prime Minister Gruevski officially meets Prince Ghazanfar of Pakistan] who claims to be related to Alexander the Great.. then uses it as an opportunity to suggest FYROM citizens are related to ancient Macedonians. (and don't get me started on that incident where Gruevski layed a wreath where a picture of """"United Macedonia"""" was clearly present... which also seems to be missing from the existing article)

Amid news of a happy reunion between Brad Pitt and his children, a report claimed that the actor received some strict guidelines from his former wife Angelina Jolie to keep their brood of six away from his ex Jennifer Aniston.

The report was soon debunked by Gossip Cop that has seemingly provided some clarifications about the trio. According to the website neither Pitt has any intention of introducing his children to Aniston, nor is the Friends actress keen on meeting the Pitt-Jolie brood.

In fact, the gossip debunking site noted that the speculative story is based on rumours of Pitt-Aniston's reunion, which itself are not true.

The site further claimed that Jolie did not have any outrageous demands like that of Pitt keeping his children away from Aniston.

InTouch Weekly had quoted its source as saying, ""As Angie and Brad's divorce talks continue, she's demanding that Brad agree to never have their children around Jen.""

The magazine mentioned that the Allied actor had been leaning on Aniston as he is going through his divorce from Jolie. Additionally, the report claimed that Pitt and Aniston had apparently reconciled and were exchanging messages.

The original report also shed light on Pitt's side of the story. ""Brad thinks the request is off the wall and irrational,"" the magazine quoted the source as saying. ""He isn't going to cave in to Angie's ridiculous demand... Angie is the one who filed for divorce, not him. And she will have to live with the consequences,"" the source claimed.

Jolie was last spotted along with four of her children in London, shopping for books.

Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016 and the couple are working on the custody of their children in private.

Inside Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner's Family Vacation in the Bahamas, Two Months After Filing for Divorce

It's been two months since Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner officially filed for divorce (and two years since they announced their separation), but they still make sure to spend quality time together with their three children, Violet, Samuel and Seraphina. 

Case in point: The whole family vacationed in Baker's Bay last week.

""Ben and Jen took a family vacation with other family friends,"" an insider tells E! News. ""There was never any question that Ben would be there. All the dads went along, and it would have been strange for the kids not to have their dad there.""
If Baker's Bay sounds familiar, that's because it's the same Caribbean island the family visited after they announced their separation in 2015. But they've been going there for years, even before that.

Of course, with the vacation comes plenty of speculation regarding their relationship status. However, our insider confirms, ""They are not getting back together at all. They are both moving on, but will continue doing things together as a family.""

We're told Ben wasn't there the entire time. Rather, he came for a few days toward the end of the trip.

As for the getaway, another source dished, ""They stayed in the same house they always stay at. It's beachfront and beautiful. It's an annual tradition for them when the kids get out of school to come for a long vacation. It's very relaxing, and they can feel like they're on island time with nowhere to go and nobody they need to see.""

So what did they do?

Our insider added, ""The kids spent a lot of time on the beach swimming and playing in the sand with their friends. They also swam in the pool at the house and visited the club. Ben and Jen both worked out at the gym daily.""

The former couple has always been very vocal that co-parenting their three children is their No.1 priority, and they will remain united as a team to do so.

""We are definitely a modern family,"" Jen told Today last summer. ""You don't have a choice,"" she added, admitting that while their new normal might look unusual to some, they're actually ""doing really well.""
Ben reiterated that statement when he told E! News, ""Jen is a superhero mom. She is an amazing mother, and I'm really lucky to have her as a partner to co-parent these kids with. We try our best, we put them first and that's what we do.""

2634,"Robert Pattinson Finally Has Successful Movie - Twilight Curse Over? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Robert Pattinson is elated at the success of his upcoming film, “Good Time”. The film premiered at Cannes Film Festival and the movie and actor received a six-minute standing ovation. There is also Oscar buzz surrounding Robert, with some speculating he could receive a Best Actor nomination.

In the gritty, crime film, Robert portrays a criminal named Connie Nikas, who plans a bank heist with his brother. Robert toned down his usually good looks, to the point of being unrecognizable and at one point, he sported shaggy, bleached blonde hair. The star admitted that he was able to shoot scenes in New York without anyone knowing who he was.

When the film premiered recently at Cannes, not only did it receive a standing ovation, there were audible cheers from audience members shouting “Bravo” and many came up to Robert to tell him what a great job he had done in the movie. Critics are also raving about the film, which is a departure for Robert, who is used to being ripped by critics and having his films tank at the box office.

Of course everyone knows Robert’s big break came with the 2008 film, “Twilight” where he portrayed broody teenage vampire, Edward Cullen, and continued with the character for a total of four movies. The “Twilight” movies became a billion dollar franchise, making Robert a household name and the object of desire for teenage girls. While he was paid millions to take on the role, it pigeon holed him in Hollywood and almost ruined his career.

For the past few year, Robert has starred in a string of box office duds, including the sappy, coming of age movie, “Remember Me” and mostly forgettable indie films. Some wondered if he would ever see box office success again, while some were quick to blame his faltering career on the “Twilight Curse”.

Since the ending of the “Twilight” and it’s sequels in 2012, most of the young stars from the movie have failed to see further success. Taylor Lautner was supposed to become the next big action star, but after the box office bomb, “Abduction”, he disappeared from Hollywood for years before returning to the small screen with “Scream Queens”.

Other actors from the movie franchise, Nikki Reed, Ashley Greene, Kellan Lutz, and Jackson Rathbone have also had trouble finding success after “Twilight” with each having a box office dud and now most are seen only in the occasional straight-to-DVD movie.

Kristen Stewart, who portrayed Bella, has continued to work regularly, although her career suffered a hiccup when it was revealed she had an affair with her married “Snow White and the Huntsman” director.

With the positive buzz surrounding his latest film, I’m sure Robert Pattinson is glad his “Twilight Curse” appears to be over.

To use another example, picked completely at random: Let's say there's been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over, say, fractional reserve banking, and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in.  Then let's say I post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now in-my-humble-view slaughtered version.  Is that """"soapboxing""""??

To use another example, closer to home.  Let's say a guy like Zenwhat says to his co-conspirators, """"What can we do to have OUR version of debt-based monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail?"""", like he clearly said here under the (desperate?) heading """"Heeeeelp"""".  

And then he also (bizarrely?) asks Gregalton help him delete references to Mises.org like he did here, saying to Gregalton: """"Also, in case you're interested, one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to Mises.org""""

As if a reference to the great Ludwig von Mises amounted to VANDALISM? Can you BELIEVE IT?  I have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this.  The guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll.  

He also says to his co-conspirator the following, on the same page: 

""""I looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. It made me realize that we're going around in circles. We improve the articles to the point that they look great. Then they get screwed up again. So, I had an idea: Would you be interested in helping me write an essay on """"Monetary Crankery""""? It could help people who AREN'T educated...The idea is for it to be straightforward, with references, but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.""""

Clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or """"satirizing"""" any positions on monetary theory that don't agree with his.  (The guy is mad.  If the guy had napalm or nukes he'd use them without hesitation.)   

Then, for good measure, he goes back to debt-based monetary system to do more """"editing"""".  

Zenwhat is clearly a piece of work.  Check out the dude's talk page.  In addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with Mises.org, his main interests appear to be something called """"cannabis culture"""" and """"the Buddhist connection with marijuana"""".  So, I gather from this that his main """"interests"""" are monetary theory and dope smoking.  What a combo!

Seeing this, I ponder my options.  I decide to post a note here, ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, asking readers to compare older (better?) versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions.  For good measure I offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the (eight?) people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page.  

It immediately gets deleted by all-seeing, all-knowing Coren as """"soapboxing"""".  Is this strict compliance with WP guidelines or a WP-style Fascist Dictatorship where people like Coren delete at will, but don't bother to make CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions as to how what I have written CAN come within the guidelines?    

This is like watching evolution in reverse.  I carefully construct a page with the help of others.  It gets vandalized by those WITH A CLEAR AND OBVIOUS objective to delete or satirize all references to Ludwig von Mises or the Austrian School (who knows what motivates these sickos?).

Over the weekend, Taylor Swift, 27, and Joe Alwyn, 26, jetted to the States from the U.K. and spent some quality time with her parents, a source tells PEOPLE exclusively.

“They arrived in Nashville on Friday and spent the weekend there together,” says the source. “Joe hasn’t spent very much time with her family before, so it does seem they are getting more serious.”

For more on Taylor Swift’s new romance with Joe Alwyn, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.

Swift — who has reportedly gotten to know Alwyn’s family in London after secretly dating him for several months — “seems relaxed and very happy” with her boyfriend, adds the source. “She’s enjoying being more low-key and Joe makes her laugh. They had a great weekend together.”

The “Shake It Off” singer may also have headed to Nashville for a special reason: her longtime best friend Abigail Anderson’s pre-wedding festivities.

Anderson shared a post on her Instagram story over the weekend that included bridesmaid gifts, and one bag had “Taylor” written on it, causing fans to speculate the star is serving as a bridesmaid.

Last year, Swift served as a maid of honor for her childhood friend Britany Maack. “I’ve never been a maid of honor before. this is my first time, and it’s really, really important to me because this is my best friend, who I’ve known since I was born,” she told PEOPLE ahead of Maack’s wedding.

NBC's live telecast of Hairspray is still underway, but Jennifer Lopez is already gearing up for the network's next big musical production, Bye Bye Birdie Live!
Lopez tweeted a video teasing the musical, in which she will star, halfway through the East Coast performance of Hairspray Live! on Wednesday evening. The show is the latest in the network's series of live televised musicals, including The Wiz, Peter Pan, and The Sound of Music.

Bye Bye Birdie Live! - and Lopez's involvement - was announced in October. The 1950s-set musical follows Elvis Presley-inspired rock & roll heartthrob Conrad Birdie as he visits a teenage fan in a small town in Ohio before being shipped off with the Army. Lopez will play Rose ""Rosie"" Alvarez, the secretary and girlfriend of Albert Peterson, a songwriter and music agent.
""It was [Lopez's] idea to take on this classic singing and dancing role made famous by the legendary Chita Rivera, and we are so happy to oblige,"" said NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt. ""This show has delighted audiences for generations ... and this will be an extravagant production built around this big star.""
Harvey Fierstein will adapt Bye Bye Birdie for the telecast; he also adapted and stars in Hairspray Live!

While the internet hunts for clues about Kylie Jenner's maybe pregnancy (along with Khloé Kardashian's maybe pregnancy and Kim Kardashian's confirmed pregnancy), at least one person has wondered, what of the reality star's famous lip fillers?

Naturally, the question comes from Kylie's plastic surgeon, Dr. Simon Ourian. In an interview with Page Six — which, aside, has a terrible and patronizing headline — Dr. Ourian shared, ""I recommend that women stop getting lip fillers as soon as they learn they are pregnant. No one knows the implications of lip fillers on pregnant patients since dermal fillers haven’t been tested on pregnant women.""

He added, ""I would never knowingly administer lip injections to a pregnant patient. In fact, it is my policy not to perform any procedures at all on pregnant women.""

Dr. Ourian also cautioned, ""If a woman receives lip fillers before becoming pregnant, the results can last several months into her pregnancy, especially if she received one of the newer longer-lasting fillers. Additionally, many women experience naturally increased lip size during pregnancy due to increased levels of estrogen, blood flow, fluids, and swelling caused by pregnancy, regardless of whether they ever received lip fillers previously.""

Kylie, for her part, has remained mum on whether she's becoming a mom. Her latest social media posts do have to do with her pout though — namely, her new Kylie Cosmetics fall Lip Kits, which are also getting an accompanying purple eyeshadow palette: ""Welcome #ThePurplePalette to the @kyliecosmetics family This beauty launches next week 10.6.17 at 3pm pst only on KylieCosmetics.com!""

Although Angelina Jolie, 41, and Brad Pitt, 53, opted to make their legal docs involving their split completely private on Jan. 10, 2017, Angie's reportedly got a new demand to add to their split negotiations. She doesn't want Brad's reported new texting buddy, Jennifer Aniston, 48, anywhere near her kids, according to In Touch.

""As Angie and Brad's divorce talks continue, she's demanding that Brad agree to never have their children around Jen,"" the mag reported. Brad and Angie share six children together - Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8.

The actor has reportedly been leaning on his ex-wife while he deals with his emotional split from Angie. He and Jen married in July 2000 and ended their courtship in Oct. 2005 after he met Angie on the set of their love, action flick, Mr & Mrs. Smith. However, he's reportedly reconciled with Jen via phone. The two have allegedly been exchanging sweet messages over various phone calls and text messages, according to the mag. To make matters worse, Angie apparently knows about Brad and Jen's alleged newfound relationship and she's not happy whatsoever.

As for Brad's take on Angie's reported request that he should keep Jen far away from their six children? - ""Brad thinks the request is off the wall and irrational,"" the mag reported. In fact, ""He isn't going to cave in to Angie's ridiculous demand... Angie is the one who filed for divorce, not him. And she will have to live with the consequences."" Harsh...

While Brad, Angie or Jennifer have not commented on this wild report, here's what HollywoodLife.com knows: ""Angelina was never able to get over her obsession with Brad and Jennifer's relationship,"" a source EXCLUSIVELY told us. As a matter of fact, Angie always feared that Brad would go back with Jen. Wow.

Things haven't been going too well for Brad throughout his nasty split with Angie. When she filed for divorce on Sept. 19, 2016, she also requested sole physical custody of their six children. Brad and Angie reached a private, temporary custody agreement on Sept. 30, which granted her full physical custody, and him with visitation approved by a therapist.

After multiple disputes between the couple in scathing court docs, they decided to release a joint statement on Jan. 10, 2017, which revealed that they agreed to keep their court docs private. Since then, the exes have remained tight-lipped on the status of their broken marriage.

Brad Pitt did not strike his son Maddox during a heated mid-flight argument with Angelina Jolie last week, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.

Pitt is accused of being ""verbally abusive"" and getting ""physical"" with one of his children on the family's private plane last Wednesday, a source previously told PEOPLE.

The L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services is investigating the 52-year-old after the alleged incident was reported to them anonymously. The case has also been referred to the FBI under special aircraft jurisdiction due to the incident being mid-flight.

""The FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,"" the FBI said in a statement.

Now the source with knowledge of the incident is speaking exclusively to PEOPLE about Pitt's side of the story.

Pitt ""was drunk, and there was an argument between him and Angelina,"" says the source. ""There was a parent-child argument which was not handled in the right way and escalated more than it should have.""

The source says Pitt did not hurt his son. ""He is emphatic that it did not reach the level of physical abuse, that no one was physically harmed. He did not hit his child in the face in any way. He did not do that; he is emphatic about that. He put his hands on him, yes, because the confrontation was spiraling out of control.""

""Brad made contact with Maddox in the shoulder area, and there was absolutely no physical injury to him.""

A source close to Pitt says any accusations beyond that are ""a combination of exaggerations and lies. They have taken the overall smallest kernel of truth – that a fight got out of hand and reached a regrettable peak, and that as a result DCFS is looking into it – and they are manipulating it to best suit their attempts to gain custody.""

Rapper-come-designer Kanye West has already conquered the music industry and taken on fashion with his Yeezy line, but now it seems that West is taking cues from his 19-year-old sister-in-law Kylie Jenner and branching out with a beauty brand.

Officially re-entering the public eye following a much-needed break from the spotlight, TMZ report that West has officially filed legal documents ""declaring his intention"" to launch a full collection of Donda cosmetics.

The line, which is thought to involve everything from makeup and perfume to lotions, will be an extension of the far-reaching communications company he named after his late mother, Donda, who passed away in 2007.

Not limited to beauty though, West has previously tweeted an infographic explaining the ""categories of influence"" that Donda as a brand might take on, including amusement parks, furnishings, fitness, medical research, hovercrafts and steamboats.

Perhaps a make-up range isn't so farfetched after all.

As someone that has shown little-to-no interest in beauty IRL, it's hard to visualise what a line of Kanye cosmetics would look like, but while mainstream cosmetics for men is still in its infancy, this does come after the likes of Maybelline and L'Oreal announced their first ever male spokesmodels.

While little else is known at this stage, following his attempts to be taken seriously as a fashion designer beauty seems a natural next step.

This morning, after a social media blackout followed closely by cryptic clips of a coiling, striking snake, Swift pulled back the curtain on her forthcoming album, Reputation —which expects a November 10 release, according to a subsequent frame—with a stark black and white beauty shot featuring a new take on her trademark beauty look.

Gone are the bangs, the polished bob , and the fringed shag . In their place, the singer debuts a dampened mane of soft, finger-raked waves, with a hint of James Dean volume at the crown. The homage makes sense: the singer's portrait strikes a rebellious note, from her posturing to the silver chain choker around her neck. And though makeup is still present, Swift's painted matte lip looks more femme fatale than ladylike, coupled with bare skin and long eyelashes. Considering the album's telling title, and the clever repurposing of social media's favorite snake emoji, it seems Swift is taking her image into her own hands. So far, devil-may-care looks good on the pop star.

They’ve got 99 problems, but security ain’t one! Beyoncé and Jay-Z asked longtime pal former President Barack Obama’s secret service detail to help protect their family after welcoming twins Rumi and Sir last month.

2540,"The Weeknd Was Spotted Holding Hands With Justin Bieber’s Ex

If you’re an avid US Weekly reader, it might appear that there are only about a dozen single people in Hollywood, as they all date each other. It’s like six degrees of separation with Kevin Bacon, only for influencers with a penchant for fit tea and waist trainers, where Scott Disick is the connecting factor.

Here, we prove that theory. After Selena Gomez and the Weeknd dated for about a year, they broke up and she was spotted back with her ex-boyfriend, Justin Bieber, almost immediately. Now, it looks like the Weeknd wants revenge, and is using his party monster ways to get it. While Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have been attending church twice in one day—apparently, the new couple has a lot to repent for—the Weeknd has been parading models around.

The Weeknd was caught canoodling with Bieber’s rumored ex, model Yovanna Ventura. He was even spotted holding hands with the model, which is almost as serious as becoming Instagram official. According to an Us Weekly source who saw The Weeknd in action, “He was parading her around. He was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the entire night.”

The potential new couple was snapped at a birthday party in Beverly Hills for French Montana (who dated Khloe Kardashian, whose sister Kourtney Kardashian was rumored to have dated Bieber—and to make everything more confusing, The Weeknd previously dated Bella Hadid, a close friend of the Kardashian/Jenner family). It’s all very Degrassi, only Drake is slightly less involved—although he’s rumored to be hooking up with Hadid and feuding with The Weeknd because of it.

The Weeknd and Ventura were also seen leaving Hyde nightclub together in the back of an SUV, much like Leonardo DiCaprio and his model friend, 19-year-old Juliette Perkins. And there’s another Leo link—The Weeknd made sure to stop by Leonardo DiCaprio’s 43rd birthday with model Emily Ratajkowski.

Leo’s birthday was held at the Highlight Room, a rooftop club that opened above the Dream Hollywood hotel in Los Angeles and currently has two stars on Yelp. Of course, there were plenty of models milling about, leaving ample options for The Weeknd—but not all of them had been linked to Bieber in the past.

It looks like Bieber, Gomez and The Weeknd should all start writing for their next break-up albums…or maybe they can all just collaborate on one.

2876,"Kendall Jenner cries over Pepsi ad backlash in ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians’ premiere

Remember Pepsi’s tone-deaf Kendall Jenner commercial back in April? The one that made people furious, because it appropriated images from Black Lives Matter protests to sell soda?

Pepsi quickly pulled the ad after intense criticism — and in the six months since the controversy, Kendall hasn’t publicly responded. That’s because she saved it all for the 14th season premiere of E!’s “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” which aired Sunday night. The Kardashian family has said that Kendall was very upset over the backlash, and the premiere confirmed that, yes, the 21-year-old supermodel was mortified.

Although the episode ended with Kendall sobbing (“Obviously, if I knew that this was going to be the outcome, I would have never done something like this”), it was a slow build to her breakdown. In fact, the word “Pepsi” never came up during the entire hour. It all started as Kendall called her sisters Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian.

“Are you okay?” Kourtney said when she answered the phone. “You sound so sad.”

“I talked to Simon today,” Kourtney said, likely referring to Simon Huck, a public relations guru and Kim Kardashian West’s close friend. “He was like, ‘The news lasts 24 hours.’ ”

Cut to an on-camera interview with Khloe, who explained to the audience: “Kendall did a commercial and basically caused a huge controversy. It sucks, because Kendall’s been taking the blame for it all. Kendall tries really hard to be socially conscious and aware of the jobs that she takes and to really think about how things affect other people, so it weighs really heavy on her heart.”

Producers showed some critical tweets about the commercial, such as, “So many adults had to f‑‑‑ up in so many unique and equally tone deaf ways to make this awful ad, it’s honestly breathtaking.”

Kourtney assured Kendall that she spoke to family friend Russell Simmons, who said that Kendall “can turn this into a positive.” This is never further explained. After they hung up, Kourtney told Khloe that it sounded like Kendall was crying.

Later, Kendall explained why she filmed the commercial in the first place — when she got the offer, she was thrilled to join the list of celebrities who have done Pepsi ads, from Michael Jackson to Beyoncé to Britney Spears.

“I trusted everyone. I trusted the teams,” she told the camera. “But after I saw the reaction and I read what people had to say about it, I most definitely saw what went wrong. I was so stuck, and I really didn’t know what to do, that I completely shut down.”

The following scene showed Kendall sitting forlornly in her gigantic walk-in closet, talking to Kim on the phone. The new issue? Her father, Caitlyn Jenner, was going on a book tour. Kendall was worried that Caitlyn might say something about the commercial that would make things worse.

“She just tends to, like, say a lot, and I just would rather everyone just not say anything,” Kendall said. “I mean, God bless her for trying.”

“I know. But Caitlyn is known for saying all the wrong things,” Kim said. She promised to call Caitlyn and let her know it was a very sensitive subject.

So Kim called Caitlyn and told her not to answer questions about the Pepsi ad — and if she felt compelled, just say something along the lines of, “Kendall had the best intentions with this being something, like, peaceful, and she totally gets everyone’s point of view now. It was not appropriate, and she’s so sorry.”

Naturally, Caitlyn did not follow that advice, and instead talked about the commercial in a radio interview and said Kendall knew all about the ad’s script beforehand and thought it was fine. The episode ended as Kendall went to talk to Kim, about three weeks after the commercial was pulled. She was upset about Caitlyn, and even more about the whole situation.

“I just feel really, really bad. Like, I feel really bad that anyone was ever offended. I feel really bad that this was taken such a wrong way,” Kendall said. “I genuinely feel like s‑‑‑, and I have no idea how I’m going to bounce back from it.”

“This is the first time you’ve had a scandal,” Kim gently reminded her. “This is your first real experience with something like this.”

“The text messages I would get from people, they’d be like, ‘It’s going to be fine, like, you know everything blows over in, like, a week’s time’ or whatever. And I’m just like, ‘Okay, but it’s been, like, three weeks and it’s not going anywhere,’ ” Kendall said.

“Yeah, but it will,” Kim assured her. “This is just going to be the biggest lesson learned for you.”

“I really don’t even know what to do at this point. It’s really depressing, and it bothers me every single day,” Kendall said.

“You’re the last person to want to hurt someone or be insensitive, but it’s, like, it really sucks. I think the only thing you can really do is just be real and honest, because you can’t ignore it. Like, you can’t,” Kim said. “It should affect you in a way where you grow from it, and you’re like, “Okay, I’m a better person from it.’ . . . I just wish that you could see that there’s light at the end of the tunnel.”

Despite Kim’s words of wisdom, Kendall still broke down crying to the camera.

“I would never purposely hurt someone, ever,” Kendall said tearfully. “You don’t know when you’re in the moment, and, like, it was the most —” She grappled for the right words. “I just felt so f‑‑‑ing stupid. The fact that I would offend other people or hurt other people was definitely not the intent. And that’s what got me the most, is that I would have ever made anyone else upset.”

After Pepsi pulled the ad, the company apologized for putting Kendall Jenner in an awkward position. Last week, Pepsi chief executive Indra Nooyi told Fortune that she didn’t initially see the ad’s final scene that caused so much “consternation,” in which Jenner handed a cop a can of Pepsi.

“This has pained me a lot because this company is known for diversity, and the fact that everybody who produced the commercial and approved the commercial did not link it to Black Lives Matter made me scratch my head. I had not seen that scene,” Nooyi said. “And I take everything personally. The minute I saw people upset, I pulled it. And you know what, it’s not worth it. There were people on both sides, but at the end of the day, our goal is not to offend anybody.”

2755,"This Is Why Taylor Swift Is Skipping the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards

There's a blank space in the VMAs seating chart this year, baby. Taylor Swift will not be attending the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday, August 28, multiple sources confirm to Us Weekly.

The country starlet turned pop phenom - who won four Moonmen at last year's ceremony, including Video of the Year for her celeb-packed ""Bad Blood"" visual - was not nominated for any Moonmen this year, though her clips for ""Wildest Dreams"" and ""Out of the Woods"" (off her blockbuster 1989 album) were both eligible.



While neither video is up for an award, the award show is still technically honoring Swift, 26, if you consider her contributions to ex-beau Calvin Harris' Rihanna-assisted hit ""This Is What You Came For,"" which is nominated for Best Collaboration. The ""Shake It Off"" hitmaker secretly sang on the track and wrote it under the pseudonym Nils Sjoberg.



Despite her lack of nominations, the Grammy winner never planned on attending this year's show. Though fans will undoubtedly miss Swift's presence on Sunday night, the highly anticipated event is shaping up to be one of MTV's most epic yet.



As Us Weekly previously reported on Thursday, August 25, artists such as Kanye West, Beyoncé and Rihanna have big plans in store. 



West, 39 - who was presented with the prestigious Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award by his sometime enemy  Swift at the 2015 VMAs - will most likely perform ""Famous,"" the controversial song in which he takes credit for the ""Blank Space"" songstress' fame. The video for the NSFW tune - featuring nude lookalikes of Swift, West, Kim Kardashian and others sleeping in bed - is nominated in several categories, including the coveted Video of the Year award.

In addition to Yeezy's performance, multiple sources confirm to Us that Queen Bey, 34, will light up the VMAs stage as well. And just when music fans thought it couldn't get any better: RiRi, who will receive the Video Vanguard Award this year, is set to sing ""several songs throughout the show,"" a source tells Us.



Confirmed performers for the show include Rihanna, Britney Spears, Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj and Future. The 2016 MTV Video Music Awards will air on MTV Sunday, August 28, at 9 p.m. ET.

 Question on Possible Citation 

I'm sorry if I missed your question - I don't pay much attention to that page. In response to your question, let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. (I haven't yet worked in """"no original research"""".) WP:NOR says that we mustn't integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. We can integrate information, so long as we don't arrive at new theories. Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. 

Getting down to details, the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. The Bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer. I'm not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. The sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made. The website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. 

Overall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. Attack articles are not encouraged. While we must show our subjects """"warts and all"""" we shouldn't enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features. Balance is a part of NPOV. - 

""""but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources."""" There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer. It isn't clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known. It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. I don't see how that can be objective. 

 Bauer 
I'm sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al., but I've been somewhat overloaded at work. Personally, I think the article is better now than when I first saw it, thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn't seem like a lynch mob. Y'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . I'm glad to help and try and make the article neater, and I don't mean to sound brusque in the summary field, but there was a lot to cram in there. Thanks for the note, I appreciate it!   
 I would say Karen saying I've called her names is an out and out fabrication. I've never done any such thing. 

""""or whether it's because he's been able to insult me and call me names on Wikipedia, repeatedly and without consequences""""

I've accused her and Jule of carrying the water for TNH and Absolutewrite and they have. That isn't namecalling by a long stretch. I'm really weary of these attacks over this. This is mob rule. While avi seems genuine, she's hanging with a tough insulting tribe. The threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. Blaming me won't make my points any less valid. Nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd. It's the Internet equivalent of stoning. 

This is not a fabrication. I get awfully tired of being called a troll, or part of a mob or cult or """"group troll,"""" or a """"self-interested partisan,"""" or a """"blog comment commando,"""" or other things I could point at if I wanted to depress myself. You also made a """"theoretical"""" comment about me being """"nosy, fat and ugly."""" Putting the word """"if"""" in front of it doesn't make it any less of an insult. I've tried to be polite to you, and will continue to do so, but this is the response. And, please notice, like abi (Avi is Avraham the admin, abi the ML commenter who believes in kindness) I counseled against piling on.  | Talk | contribs

2135,"Relevance? 

'In a New Zealand TV2 series presented by Rebecca Gibney called Sensing Murder, which aired on TVNZ beginning in 2006, three psychic mediums from Australia and New Zealand, Sue Nicholson, Kelvin Cruickshank and Deb Webber, armed only with photographs of the victims of unsolved murders, and purportedly no prior knowledge of the cases, attempted to help police detectives and a team of investigators by communicating with the spirits of the victims to uncover details of their life and death. The team of investigators followed up the psychics’ leads and apparently came up with information about the killers and whereabouts of victims' remains.[27] Skepticism regarding the series has come from several sources,[28][29][30] and it was further satirized in the season finale, where host Jeremy Wells humorously highlighted the fact that not a single case had been solved.[31]'

Just how relevant is this? Granted, it does provide criticism, yet it is from a television show. We are given no knowledge of the reputation or fame of these mediums, so it is difficult to criticise all based on a few. If high profile mediums were used, I would have been inclined to agree on the inclusion.

Whilst the rest of the criticism section is valid and comes from scientists etc, the validity of a statement by a television presenter is small, and it is difficult to see any real reason for the inclusion other than to bolster the criticism section.

2043,"""For the record, Larson was working on a Battlestar Pegasus movie for about 8-9 months when it became apparent that Universal wasn't going to go anywhere with the Galactica franchise. It turned out that Larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on Universal's part to do anything with Commander Cain and the Pegasus, and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the Atlantis, which was built by the 13th Tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to Earth. The film would have dealt with the search, a major battle with the Cylons, and the recovery and use of the maps to reach Earth, all w/o involving the Galactica or the RTF other than being mentioned.

The first article Google shows is this one: . And the Wikipedia set up for BSG had this one: [], although I'm not sure about whether there's some Wikirule about referencing other mini-Wikis. The John Larocque article on the attempt is at: []. Hollywood North Report has a short blurb about the Larson effort, but seeing as how their site has a *LOT* of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware, I'll quote it here to save your systems:
""""In the spring of 1999, it was announced that Glen Larson was making plans to bring Galactica to the silver screen.  Impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film Wing Commander, Larson paired with its producer, Todd Moyer, on an estimated $40-50 million film that was to shoot later that year in Luxembourg. 

The story picked up where the series left off, but followed the exploits of Commander Cain and the battlestar Pegasus (made famous in the original series episode, """"The Living Legend,"""" guest starring the late Lloyd Bridges).  In the concept, Commander Cain's search for the lost battlestar Galactica leads him to contemporary Earth, which, according to the story, was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar, Atlantis.

Special effects were to be handled by Moyer's company, No Prisoners 3DFX, utilizing several of the artists who worked on Wing Commander.  Moyer planned to update some of Galactica's ships, including giving the Vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkers-à la The Transformers-when on planet surfaces.  Moreover, he and Larson planned to expand the Galactica franchise to include an Imax film, a theme ride, and a new line of merchandise.

Then, as quickly as it had been announced, the project vanished from the radar screen.  It has been suggested that Larson and Moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues.  It has also been suggested that the film rights to Battlestar Galactica were still in some dispute.  In either case, the project disappeared into the ethers.""""

The days loses were as already given. Specifically Spitfire claims were not discussed, so the Spitfire's percentage of the kill total is unknown, which is conveyed in the article.

More importantly, citations have been given for for the Order of Battle figures. Your lack of understanding of how any historian presents his work work is palpable. OOB are given in lists, as you should know, so your """"give me a quote"""" tone is rather silly. Caldwell makes it quit clear that these lists are incomplete with regard to strength returns given. He gives known strength returns. As for Total German day fighter strength, again this estimated by Caldwell (as strength returns for all 6 years are obviously incomplete). He points out, and totally refutes your claim that the bulk of these machines were deployed against the oilfields in September 1944. 
1,000 in the defence of central Europe were available for operations at this time, while 1,800 alone were available for combat in the west. German fighter units in Romania in September 1944 were mixed in with Eastern front units by June 1944, making it impossible to tell just how many fighters were operating in the """"oil"""" capacity at this time. Even considering that all E.F fighters were at some point deployed in Romania they only reach a combined total of 2,250 compared to a total of 1,800 plus 1,000 for the other two fronts (negating even the Med. Theatre). So your generalisation of a """"quote"""", if this indeed is what it is, makes the Bulk of the German fighter force concentrated in Romania false.

While it should be a happy occasion as you’re endlessly snapped by hungry photographers, people were left baffled as Kirsten strutted the aisle in uncontrollable tears.

However it seems the tears can be explained, with Kirsten’s rep telling Metro.co.uk the outburst happened due to the overwhelming matter of sharing the carpet with Coppola.

Hi again dear

yes I strongly support independence of """"south Azerbaijan"""" from Iran, If Green movement could change somethings, probably I would change my idea, but I dont want to be under Islamic rejim anymore and I support the changing of destiny of Azerbaijani people.

And about """"Azerbaijanis are Turks or not"""". Despite you are talking about Persian theory of the roots of Turkish people, we all know that Turks started to migrate here circa 1000 ad when Saljuk Turks of west branch(Oghuz)started to come, but infact it is not important when they came here. The important thing is """"EVERY ONE"""" in Azerbaijan feel themselves as Azerbaijani( and not Azeri which is an invented word by Persians) Turks and believe that they r Turks and speak Turkish lang. as same as Turks of Turkey. You can come here and ask yourself one by one, you will see. It is so irrarational to say to some one that:"""" No, you r not Turk, you dont know who you are! I know! you r Azeri and Azeris are indoeuropean."""" Pls dont tell us who we r! let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a Turk whatever others like or not. 

About Aran, as I know we didnt have """"Eyalat Aran"""" in the Qajar era. We had """"Eyalat Azarbaijan"""" and both Azerbaijan rep. and Armenia was part of this big Eyalat as well as south Azerbaijan. Aran was part of this big land. But the important thing is, the name of land is not important here as well, the important thing is the people who live in Azerbaijan rep.( former Aran as you called) are of my race and we r same nation. You may call there Azerbaijan or Aran but the important thing is: """"here a nation live which called themselves Azerbaijani Turks!"""". You may call them whatever you want as well as their land, the important thing is what they call themselves. If they change the name of their republic, will you satisfy? what about next? will you ask them to call themselves """"Arani"""" and start to speak """"Aranian"""" language! which does not exist! 

Ok let's think Azerbaijanis r not Turk, so what they r? Azeri? Ok, let's call them Azeri, what is the next step? You will ask them to forget to speak in Turkish language and start to speak Persian? Or not, speak Azeri lang.? So what is Azeri lang.? where is it? Can you learn it to about 32 million people? let's thing pragmatic as well as rational. Even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically, you cant ask them to speak neither a lang. of 1000 years ago nor Persian.

Also I dont rely neither to researches of Kasravi nor Zehtabi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments. One was Paniranist other was Panturkist. Some of their researches looks really funny!

About the names of Turkish places and cities, I guess you have never ever travell to Azerbaijan. If you were here, you'll see that Iranian government has changed the names during Pahlavi era! Some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us. for example Tabriz has a suburb in Western part of the city called """"Akhmagaya"""" which in Turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place, do u know what is its official name? """"Ahmagiyyeh!"""" the lands of stupid people! All of the Turkish names tried to change to a Persian words which looks verbally simmilar them! The fact is Persian never have been to Azerbaijan. Most of the Azerbaijani names have Armenian or Tat roots not Persian. My believe is that a mixture of differnet natios like Tats, Armenians, and other caucasian tribes lived here and then Turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called Azerbaijani Turks nowadays. They have their own culture, music, dance, cuisine etc. which seperate them form Persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of Turks of Anatolia which believes that they r 100 percent Turk! I told you history is not important than today, the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a Turk. I dont know what they want us to feel in Tehran!

The name of Azar abade gan looks wrong as well. This word cant change to Azarbaijan during history. I guess the word was """"Azar pay gan"""" (maybe) which zoroastrian Persians called, not Azar abad gan which Ferdowsi mentioned in Shahnameh and everyone got to accept it now!

I had a look to your files about vote frauding which I still believe is correct as well. The diagrams of those .pdf pages show that people of Iran will give their votes to Ahmadinezhad when that company asked them before election, but you know there is unwrittenable rules in Iran which every one know. Whenever some one come and ask me in person that """"do u like Islamic republic, Ali khameni and bla bla bla"""" I will answer """"YES""""! cos I dont want to lose my life! We dont have life guaranty",0

Pop songbird Gwen Stefani could end up deaf and wreck her fabulous singing career

by performing too soon after rupturing her eardrum, say experts.

Docs ordered the Voice coach not to sing or travel by plane after her career-threatening health crisis.

But The Sweet Escape singer insisted on belting out a tune on The Voice just a week later.

Her beau and fellow coach, Blake Shelton, praised his platinum blond gal pal as “tough,”

“Loud music or singing could cause further damage and lead to partial or permanent deafness,”

says New York internist Dr. Stuart Fischer, who has not treated the singer.

The mom of three’s nightmare turned terrifyingly real on an April 25 flight from L.A. to Las Vegas, where she was to sing

at the Keep Memory Alive’s Power of Love gala. “She had a head cold, and the pressure in the cabin blew her eardrum out,” says a source.

“It happened so suddenly. She lost her hearing and landed in a hospital.

“I’m sure she was terrified her career could be over!” But just days later, Blake happily declared his babe “can hear now.”

With only a few weeks until The View premieres with Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O'Donnell, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that on the set, the two divas are already at a stand-off over who will get the moderator seat.

Goldberg has sat in the prized moderator seat since taking over from O'Donnell, and now ""Rosie wants it back from Whoopi,"" an insider told Radar. ""It doesn't matter to Rosie that Whoopi has sat there for the last several years. Rosie doesn't want to be sitting anywhere but back in her old spot.""

""In Rosie's mind, this is once again her show,"" the source continued. ""Whoopi won't be giving it up, and Rosie even suggested they trade seats every other week. It's all a power trip for Rosie, which is resulting in tension on the staff.""

PHOTOS: Celebs Who Are Most Popular On Twitter

And even though Goldberg just signed a four-year contract as a co-host on the hit ABC show,  a source tells The National ENQUIRER that she already wants out!

""Whoopi regrets roping herself in like that and is trying to figure a way out,"" said a source close to Goldberg. ""She wants to do other projects and feels network honchos are holding her back.""

Goldberg dissed The View's executive producer and founder Barbara Walters, who retired in May, following a screening of potential replacements.

Goldberg allegedly snapped​, ""I've been working with a cranky 85-year-old woman who's been mad about everything for two years, and I need a break,"" referring to Walters.

After co-hosts Jenny McCarthy and Sherri Shepherd were forced out, and it was announced recently that controversial host O'Donnell will return, Goldberg doesn't trust anyone that's left on the hit show.

The tension isn't ""bothering ABC executives because this is what they wanted...There hasn't been this buzz around The View for a long time,"" the insider added. ""Bringing Rosie back was a guarantee that there would be controversy. Rosie has been boasting she will be at The View for a very long time, and won't be playing second fiddle to anyone.""

2526,"Blake Griffin: Did He Kick His Baby Mama Out For Kendall Jenner?

It's only been a few weeks since the world learned that Blake Griffin and Kendall Jenner are dating, but it looks as though the lanky couple is moving very fast.

They've been hanging out in public; she's already banned from the Staples Center ...

Yes, they've checking off items from the ""new Kardashian-professional athlete relationship"" checklist at breakneck speed.

There's just one problem.

Neither Blake nor Kendall was 100 percent single when they met, which means they're both in the process of distancing themselves from their most recent exes as they simultaneously attempt to build a new relationship together.

Insiders say Kendall was still dating A$AP Rocky when she started hooking up with Blake, but it sounds like that situation won't present much of a challenge.

“He isn’t the type to settle down or be a good boyfriend, so she’s playing the field too,"" one insider said of Rocky.

So we imagine he wasn't too torn up about being cut from Team Kendall.

Blake, on the other hand, is in a bit of a tighter spot.

The LA Clippers forward has two kids with Brynn Cameron, whom he dated for several years.

Though the couple had experienced relationship troubles in recent months and even lived apart during a trial separation, sources say Cameron was blindsided by the news that Griffin was dating Kendall.

According to sources close to the couple, Cameron unexpectedly moved out of the home she previously shared with Griffin this week.

And naturally, many are claiming that Kendall is to blame.

""Both Brynn and Blake have been staying at rented places since their breakup happened. It seemed like they wanted to give it time for the dust to settle before disrupting the kids with a big move,"" one insider reveals.

""That said, Brynn feels totally betrayed and mortified that Blake has chosen to be so public with Kendall, and she just wants this whole mess to be over,"" the informant adds.

""He’s in Clippers training camp now, so she figured it was the perfect time to do it.""

So it sounds like Blake and Brynn were headed in the vague direction of Splitsville, but Kendall was what drove them to finally call it quits.

Fans are reportedly angry, as Brynn was a beloved member of the Clippers community.

Wait until the NBA season starts and all the ""Kardashian curse"" talk comes with it.

2013-06-17T14:07:39-04:00
It truly is an end of an era. Rosie O'Donnell is no longer a resident of Star Island. The comedienne first bought the historic home back in 1999 for $6.75 million from a marijuana-loving church, and sold it recently for nearly $10 million more.

As chronicled in Rakontor's Square Grouper, the home was once the headquarters of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.

The Rastafari church (which isn't really Ethiopian not Coptic) bought the home back in 1975, and their marijuana-loving ways didn't please the neighbors much. So, even Elizabeth Hassleback would have preferred Rosie as a neighbor compared to the previous tenants.

The home boasts 11,104 square feet of space, two guest homes and 200 feet of bay frontage.

O'Donnell, who originally listed the home for close to $20 million, reportedly sold the home because she had barely been using in recent years, according to The New York Post.

Kate Middleton might be angry with her husband Prince William for embarrassing their family with his bizarre dancing and drinking during his ski trip, and all of the cheating rumors, but that doesn’t mean she’ll be divorcing him anytime soon. In fact, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tried to convince everyone that they are still madly in love during their trip to Paris this weekend.

Prince William and Kate Middleton rekindled their shared love of art during a visit to the Musee D’Orsay in Paris. The Duke and Duchess first fell in love while studying art history at St Andrew’s University in Scotland nearly two decades ago.

Eyewitnesses say that art enthusiast Kate Middleton asked lots of questions during their tour of the museum with William by her side. Kate certainly did show the public that she was still angry at her husband as she tried to remain as calm and engaged as possible during their tour. Insiders say that Prince William, meanwhile, looked tired and tense.

Judging from the photos that were snapped, there is some major tension between the Royal couple right now.  Kate looked absolutely miserable!

There’s a possibility that Kate Middleton is worried that if she does divorce Prince William, she won’t have the same privileged lifestyle that she has now. It’s no secret that the Duchess of Cambridge makes headlines simply because she’s Prince William’s wife. But, if she decides to pull the plug on her royal marriage, Kate’s life won’t be the same.

She won’t be generating publicity for what she wore or how she looked during her public appearances. And, that’s probably what she’ll miss the most. Kate Middleton loves the spotlight but without the royal family, she won’t be in it anymore.

Plus, royal observers know that if Kate Middleton forgives Prince William for his antics drunken antics now, there’s a good chance that she’ll forgive him again and again. In other words, the Duchess is turning a blind eye to her husband’s behavior because she probably doesn’t have any other choice. It’s either this or she goes back to her mother Carole Middleton’s party favor business. Do you agree?

 Reply to """"On gender"""" 

Your posted: Don't guess at someone's gender, as you have done here.  It is uncivil, and could in fact be taken as insult.  Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc.  It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— dαlus Contribs 

If you know your friend’s gender, spit it out, you stupid ass. Your entire posting, if you didn’t have the agenda I ascribe to you, infra, would have been “FYI: He/she is a female/male” and I would adjust accordingly. Hell, if you tell me that Dayewalker is a consortium, and I’d refer to Dayewalker as “they/it.” Don’t continue to be an ass if you post further, or understand that your further postings are unworthy of reply.

I note that you are not correcting your friend Dayewalker when she posts to you 6 days ago """"I saw that afterwards, I knew HE was topic banned but it had slipped my mind about the overall bannation. Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010."""" Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to """"he’;"""" or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the """"he"""" is actually a """"she"""" and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the """"he"""" is too ballsy or pushy to be a woman/“lady.” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she.” Don't be an ass.

If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like """"Mr."""" or """"Ms."""" Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion. If you wish to join into the discussion, please feel free. On second thought, don’t join in. I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either. Dayewalker (he she, they, etc.) doesn’t answer his question. Ut oh, now I’ve called Chowbok a “he.” No doubt her boyfriend/girlfriend will rush in to call me a “beast” and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground. If Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a """"sissy"""" or a """"girlie,"""" then she can address that with me. He doesn't need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banned. And by """"protector,"""" I mean you. You are an ass. Male. Female. Both. Neither. And of whatever ‘sexual orientation,” if any, that you wish to use to identify yourself, or not identify yourself, or feel the need to identify yourself, or feel the need to keep private, or over which you do not care.

2837,"Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Have Seemingly Dropped Their Stealth Act

For more than four years, rumors have surrounded Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx, and their apparent under-the-radar romance. For a pair of very famous people they’ve managed to avoid the cameras for ages, though in the last year they seemed to be making less of an effort to hide, even spotted in May boarding a private plane in Paris, where Foxx was filming Robin Hood. At the same time, tabloids claimed that the two were “ready to go public.”

And now, perhaps, that glorious time has come. A photograph on the Daily Mail captures the two holding hands on the beach in Malibu—not exactly walking a red carpet together or making it Instagram-official, but the only public display of affection ever witnessed from these two in the wild.

The two have been rumored to take Secret Service-level precautions in their relationship; they reportedly took secret back elevators and cars with tinted windows on dates that seemed more like undercover missions. But in mid-April, a source told Us Weekly that Holmes, who has largely kept her life with her 11-year-old daughter, Suri Cruise, private, no longer wanted to play “the hiding game” that she and Foxx had mastered since they were first seen together in the late summer of 2013.

Five years since her divorce from Tom Cruise, Holmes remains a frequent tabloid subject, though her and Foxx’s efforts and secrecy have paid off; most headlines focus on her relationship with daughter Suri, or maybe her fashion choices, rather than any romance rumors. In February, just before she and Foxx began to tease out their public relationship, Holmes told Town & Country that, regardless of what gets printed, she and Suri aren’t paying attention anyway.

“In today’s world a lot of celebrities probably shield their children from the tabloids; in my household we know what they print isn’t true, so we don’t pay attention.”

2787,"Nicki Minaj Did NOT Wear Hot Pants And Crop Top To Serena Williams’ Wedding, Despite Report 

Nicki Minaj did not wear hot pants and a crop top to Serena Williams’ wedding, despite a bogus report based on a photoshopped image. For starters, the rapper didn’t even attend the tennis star’s nuptials. Gossip Cop can set the record straight. Williams got married to internet entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian in front of friends and family in New Orleans on Thursday. The guest list included many celebrities, including Beyonce, Kim Kardashian, Kelly Rowland, Anna Wintour, Ciara and Eva Longoria. Minaj wasn’t in attendance, but the Irish website Her posted a doctored Instagram photo that shows her posing at the party with Beyonce and Rihanna. The site titled its inaccurate article, “What Nicki Minaj wore to Serena Williams’ wedding is not really OK,” and says the singer showed up to the ceremony sporting “white leather hotpants and a crop top.” The misinformed outlet insists Minaj’s outfit was “kinda too much,” further maintaining that she “very much overstepped a wedding etiquette line.” But the site’s opinion about the rapper’s attire is completely moot. Neither Minaj or Rihanna were at the tennis player’s wedding. Both music stars were superimposed into a photo of Beyonce posing alone at the ceremony. It’s unclear if the Irish outlet is trying to trick its readers or get duped by the fake image itself, but Minaj didn’t wear an inappropriate outfit to Williams’ wedding, which she didn’t attend. It should be noted, Gossip Cop has had to debunk several false stories surrounding the tennis star’s nuptials in the short time since she walked down the aisle. We recently busted HollywoodLife for fabricating a report about Beyonce and Kardashian having an “icy exchange” at the wedding. Gossip Cop also called out RadarOnline for making up a story about Kardashian getting yelled at for using her phone at Williams’ wedding. This latest article related to the event is similarly phony.

2615,"What Sort of Diva Demands Does Mariah Carey Have for ‘American Idol’?

We still can't get over the fact that the No. 1 diva herself Mariah Carey has agreed to be a judge on ' American Idol .' Of course, with a price tag of $18 million, we're not terribly surprised, but we have a sneaking suspicion she agreed because she feels the need to compete with veteran competitors like ' X Factor ' judge Britney Spears and ' The Voice ' judge Christina Aguilera .

Carey has carried the label ""diva"" with her for years, so the 'Idol' staff is doing the only thing they can at the moment: preparing. Her backstage rider has previously consisted of outrageous demands, so it's no wonder staffers are bracing themselves for Carey's arrival. Let's take a look at some of her previous requests:

Done scratching your head yet? Okay. But the following may be most shocking of all: a source close to the singer said Carey won't require anything out of the ordinary for 'Idol.' Whaaaaaaaaat?  ""It’s all standard stuff, nothing out of the ordinary,""  said the source. ""It’s not like they’ll need to put a new roof on the building. It’s standard lists, whether it’s for water, soda, veggies, snacks. It’s all fairly normal.""

Perhaps motherhood is having big impact on Carey's not-so-divalike behavior? Who can think about a frolicking in a mountain of kittens when you have two crying toddlers to take care of? And since the show has ""its own branded requirements for stars to use the products of certain sponsors,"" maybe her demands will be kept at an all-time low!

2734,"Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi Host Saving SPOT! Fundraiser

It's been a busy October so far with pet rescue events seemingly popping up all over the greater Los Angeles area.

I've been fortunate enough to work with Emmy award-winning actress Jane Lynch to help animals and people in need through K9s for Warriors and The Rescue Train (see Glee' Star Jane Lynch Helps Place Dogs with PTSD Soldiers and Actress Jane Lynch Raises Awareness for Pets in Need).

The star power at my next pet-rescue event was just taken up a notch at the 2nd annual fundraiser for the Saving SPOT! Rescue.

The SPOT! storefront from which the rescue operates, is the impassioned business of Lizzie Scherer. She and her family and staff work tirelessly to help ensure that dogs up for adoption are healthy and placed in suitable forever homes. The event was held at the Thomson Hotel in Beverly Hills, CA.

Media icon Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, lent their luminous presence to the cause by hosting the live auction where they auctioned off the opportunity to travel on a Toms shoes and eyewear trip to deliever shoes to children. The jovial and convincing nature of Degeneres brought the value of the auction item up to over $8,000, all of which was ultimately donated to Saving SPOT! Rescue.

DeGeneres has supported the Saving Spot! Rescue for years and even features the rescue's adoptable dogs on her EllenTV.com website. Recently, she posted profiles of English Cocker Spaniels hilariously named Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha after HBO's Sex and the City.

Present at the SPOT! event were a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors of cute dogs in need of adoption. Degeneres and De Rossi were photographed holding the puppies and were particularly drawn to a petite puppy having a jet-black coat.

Did DeGeneres and de Rossi take another pooch home to add to their growing number of canine and feline family members? I don't know for sure, but what I do know is that the couple already cares for Mabel, a black Standard Poodle, and Wolf, a mixed breed suspected to be a hybrid of Poodle-Maltese.

Although Mabel is a pure-breed dog, she was reportedly rescued from a less-than-ideal living environment. According to an interview with peoplepets.com (EXCLUSIVE! Ellen DeGeneres Chats About Her Pets), Mabel ""was kind of a show dog early in her career, and, like many models, got too old for it. She was in a kennel, she was not needed anymore so we got her from this guy. She was definitely not in a horrible situation; she was in a situation where she needed a home.""

Wolf also has a unique rescue story, as DeGeneres says, ""I wasn't looking for a dog. I happened to spot a man that was not completely balanced. He was a guy that was mistreating the dog. He was swinging the dog around and doing things to it and I went over to him and offered to give him some money. It was a long, long story but the guy was very strange and had smuggled the dog in from Mexico and was not planning on doing things to it, so it took me hours to get that dog from that guy. Anyway, Wolf was in pretty bad shape. He was tiny ... he was [malnourished], he couldn't stand up. His back legs couldn't support him because he had never been put down and maybe damaged on the way in, being smuggled in. It's just the craziest story. But he's just the craziest, sweetest dog now. Just a love!""

Cats are also part of the family and have the unique names Chairman, Charlie, and George. ""Charlie has a dog personality where she has to be wherever people are and follow you from room to room,"" according to DeGeneres.

A variety of other celebrities were also on hand to support Saving SPOT! Rescue, including:

I had a very pleasant conversation with actress Allison Janney, who I met a few years back at a Los Angeles dog park after she showed interest in my dog Cardiff. After reminding her of our meeting, Janney told me all about the canine companions with whom she shares her home. Hopefully, I'll soon be caring for her dogs as my patients.

The night wrapped up with happy humans having congregated for a good cause and raised lots of money to help support the ongoing efforts of Saving Spot! Rescue.

Next time Justin Bieber buys someone flowers, he's definitely going to include a vase.

On Thursday, photos emerged of Justin Bieber walking around LA with a suspicious stain on his pants, with the Internet speculating that the 22-year-old singer couldn't make it to the bathroom fast enough.

To make matters worse, the pants in question were grey sweats from the celebrity-adored fashion brand Vetements, retailing at a price tag of $690. (Bieber's ex Selena Gomez is also a fan of the brand's sweatpants, wearing a similar green pair last year in Tokyo.)









 As Bieber followers may recall, this isn't the star's first brush with public urination. In 2013, Bieber urinated into a mop bucket while his friends filmed the incident, which ending with him lobbing expletives at former President Bill Clinton, for which he later apologized.

This time around, Bieber quickly set the record straight on Twitter, explaining he experienced a different kind of accident.

""Someone got me flowers and I was driving, made a turn, and the water spilled on my (expletive) area...Didn't bother me if it made ya laugh nice!"" he tweeted.

Please don't change """"At bat"""" to """"at-bat"""". """"At-bat"""" just redirects right back to at bat anyway. -  

I agree.  

I agree because he is correct that it should not be hyphenated.  

In addition, pls stop edit warring at Matt Joyce (baseball), Ian Kinsler, Craig Breslow, etc.  

And add to the list Matt Guerrier.  It is perfectly accurate and reasonable to reflect his won lost record.  There is no reason to delete it, other than your penchant for disruptive edits.  Kindly desist.  

It has also been explained to you, with proper citations, that the plural of RBI is RBIs.  Pls stop edit warring this point.  See Juan Encarnación and Terry Tiffee.  That is vandalism.  
Run batted in says: """"The term may be pluralized as either RBI or RBIs"""". Obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then.
@Matt Guerrier, the reason it didn't show up was because a """"|"""" was missing, and with your edit you re-removed it and duplicated info.
It's amazing how you continue to assume bad faith, blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page...  (t / c) 

Danged if this little war isn't over some seriously picayune crap. Both sides are being a bit petty here, because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages (well, except for the bolded Contract on Ian Kinsler  either make it a subhed or take it off, seriously).

Oh, and technically, the plural of RBI is RsBI, but that just looks clunky. In common usage, """"RBI"""" is used for either singular """"Run Batted In"""" or plural """"Runs Batted In"""". """"RBIs"""" is a bastardization used only because it's simpler from a usage standpoint.

Either way, I think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. -  

Jackal4, again, is making a rash of these edits on every page I touch.  As to RBIs, as X96lee15 pointed out the most thorough treatment is at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Baseball/Archive_5#RBIs.  Plus, mlb.com is the official reporter of baseball, and uses the RBIs convention.  Yet, Jackal4's reaction to that is to go on pages where I have written it thus, to delete the s  as though the s is incorrect.  He has done the same with """"at bat""""  which he insists must be hyphenated.  Etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits.  It is picayune, but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits.  If he insisted on lower-casing RBIs, or any similar degradation, I would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits.  There is enough good work he could perform instead.  

 Well, I can't stop him from wasting time if that's what he wants to do ) .

 As for """"thorough treatment"""", I'm not sure I consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. I respect Kingturtle, but I think he's got it wrong on this one. Regarding what mlb.com uses, you're appealing to the wrong authority, because it's not a terminology issue, it's a grammar issue.

 In any case, at this point I have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because you're both watching for each other's names on your watchlists. Allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each other's edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb. At the rate you're going, you're both going to get blocked. -  

Jargon overrides grammar. To say that a batter """"flied out"""" is probably not good grammar either, but it's proper baseball terminology. I think this needs to be discussed at the project page, assuming anyone's watching that page anymore. [[User:Baseball",0
2590,"Brad Pitt’s bodyguard says he’s seeing another actor, almost as big as Angelina

Actor Brad Pitt thinks his children are being turned against him and reportedly even stormed out of a meeting with his children.

The Allied actor is concerned that his estranged wife and actor Angelina Jolie is trying to turn their six children -- Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and eight-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne -- against him and have even stopped calling him daddy, reports femalefirst.co.uk.

Kris Herzog, a bodyguard who works for both the family and Jolie’s father Jon Voight, says that Pitt’s two supervised visits with his brood have not gone well.

“Brad is so angry. From what I’ve heard from Brad and Jon, even the kids are turning against him. He’s alleging they won’t even speak to him and they won’t call him daddy or father. They’ve had two meetings with Los Angeles family services and in both none of the kids would talk to him,” Herzog told Grazia magazine.

“He stormed out of the second one really angry, it was the straw that broke the camel’s back. This fight is going nuclear now,” he added.

Herzog has also claimed Pitt has already moved on from Jolie and is secretly seeing someone else.

“He’s started seeing another famous actor. She is a personal friend of mine and has told me they are sleeping together. I can’t disclose who it is but she is almost as big as Angelina,” he said.

Despite the Fury star’s frustration with his estranged spouse, he is unwilling to play dirty in their custody battle because he doesn’t want to upset the children further.

2486,"Queen Elizabeth and Kate Middleton Clash Again: Duchess Scared of Difficult Pregnancy, Adopting Second 'Royal' Baby - Reports

Kate Middleton is said to have miscarried. However, a new report claims otherwise. The new report says that it is impossible for Prince George's mom to have miscarried her second baby when she is not keen on getting pregnant anymore and would rather adopt instead. In fact, this is one of the things that Kate and Queen Elizabeth are arguing heatedly about.

The Aug. 11th print edition of Life & Style Magazine claims that Kate Middleton and Queen Elizabeth are in a serious row. This is not because Kate Middleton lost what could have been the baby sister (reportedly!) of Prince George, but because she does not want to get pregnant again at all. The assumption is that Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles' wife is the only royalty getting on the nerves of Queen Elizabeth, but it seems as if Kate Middleton is rubbing the Queen the wrong way too.

Celeb Dirty Laundry reports that Kate Middleton had it with all the meddling the Queen is doing with her personal affairs, especially on how to raise Prince George and when she should get pregnant again. Even though she originally wanted a lot of kids, having a difficult pregnancy with her first child made her apprehensive and scared about having another baby. Even though she's not entirely closing her doors to another baby, Kate is said to not want to have a second baby just yet.  Allegedly, she would rather adopt than have another one!

Because what the Queen wants, the Queen should get, Kate's attitude is making the Queen see red.  The idea that an adopted baby will grow up to become royalty is enough to send the Queen to a frenzy.  Royal tradition would say that only a baby with the royal family's bloodline would be considered ""a spare"" for the throne, so what Kate is suggesting will blow that tradition off. Kate knows this but she also observes that the Queen has not been that inflexible with other things to accommodate the needs of a modern monarchy. She is hoping against hope that the Queen might budge on this one so she does not undergo another difficult pregnancy and she would get to raise a child that is desperate for a good home, Celeb Dirty Laundry reports.

This is not the first time that Kate Middleton's ways and ideas crossed the Queen. The Life & Style magazine's July 14 feature ""Tormented by the Queen,"" said the Queen flew into rage when she learned of Middleton's plans to move baby Prince George out of London.

Kate Middleton just wants to spend more time enjoying Prince George rather than plan another baby though. For this summer, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would change their yearly summer plan of vacationing in the private island of Mystique. With Prince George now in tow, August will be spent a bit differently.

""The couple will spend the rest of the time off in Norfolk, where the final refurbishments are being completed at their new country home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen's Sandringham Estate,"" shared royal family sources with Vanity Fair.

2754,"Those Miley Cyrus wedding rumours have been cleared up

Miley Cyrus's sister, Noah Cyrus, has addressed rumours that her big sister married Liam Hemsworth.

On Saturday, 17-year-old Noah attended the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in Los Angeles where she vehemently denied the rumours.


""She's not married,"" said Noah.

The pop singer then addressed the photo that her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, posted that showed Miley in a white dress. They were ""probably just having fun or something,"" she said.

Since rekindling their relationship at the beginning of 2016, Miley and Liam have appeared happier than ever, with Miley even getting a tattoo dedicated to her man.

Liam has professed his love for Vegemite countless times in interviews, which is why everyone's convinced it's for him.

Their love story 2.0 started when Miley and Liam hung out over Christmas and New Year in 2015. ""Miley came back to LA after spending the holidays with Liam. She had the time of her life being with him and his family,"" a source told E! News at the time.

Miley also set tongues wagging when she posed for a photo on Instagram wearing the engagement ring Liam gave her the first time around...

To be fair, if we had a 3.5-carat, custom-designed Neil Lane engagement ring we would never take it off.

It was back in April 2016, the pair were spotted out together for the first time...

When we first heard the news that old flames Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth were back together after splitting back in 2013, we were thrilled.

An insider told E News! at the time that Liam's family is pleased to have Miley back in their life, and think that they can make it work now that they're older.

""Liam never stopped loving Miley. Liam and Miley's timing was just off the first time they were engaged, many things played into them calling it off,"" an insider told the website.

""They both needed to grow up and figure themselves out more.

""Liam's family... always liked Miley but they supported Liam's decision at the time. They did feel that both of them were too young.""

The source added, ""They are in love and it's a different time now for them.""

Back in 2015, when the pair had broken up, Liam opened up about his five year relationship with Miley saying his feelings for her will never change.

Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg is at the right location. His uncle, and then his cousin, was the Fürst while Felix's position all of his life was that of a Prinz (this distinction is tougher for families where all used Fürst, like Wrede, and also titles like Herzog and Graf but it is easily determined). I am as certain as you are about Alfred III because you moved him to the numeral and the only royalty who used numerals, other than the Heinrichs Reuss, were the heads of houses and families. Friedrich Johannes Jacob Celestin von Schwarzenberg has the wrong nobiliary particle anyway, he was zu, not von. He was also a junior prince because he had an older brother who outlived him who was also """"the"""" Prince (John Adolph II). I don't mind leaving the German """"von"""" or """"zu"""" for princes of territories if the title isn't used. For instance, Felix zu Schwarzenburg and Prince Felix of Schwarzenburg would both be acceptable but not a mixture. Adolph von Auersperg had an older brother who died after him but a source I have gives Adolph's title as Fürst, which wouldn't make sense. I would leave him be for now and ask on his page if he was head of the house. Prince Karl of Auersperg is actually the brother in question so logic would mean that he was the Fürst but again, I would ask on the page. Charles 17:04""",0

2705,"Billy Bush officially sacked from NBC Today show after leaked lewd Donald Trump tape scandal

Bush was suspended at the morning show two days after contents of the 2005 tape were reported on October 7.

NBC and Bush's representatives had been negotiating terms of his exit before Monday's announcement.

On the tape, Bush is heard laughing as Trump talks about fame enabling him to grope and try to have sex with women not his wife. Bush later said he was ""embarrassed and ashamed."" Trump has since denied groping women.

Bush, who had been at Today for two months, is the nephew of Republican former President George H.W. Bush.

NBC made the announcement of his firing in a note from Today show top executive Noah Oppenheim to his staff. Oppenheim called Bush, who spent 15 years at Access Hollywood, ""a valued colleague and longtime member of the broader NBC family. We wish him success as he goes forward.""

Bush, a 44-year-old father of three, said that he was ""deeply grateful for the conversations I've had with my daughters, and for all of the support from family, friends and colleagues. I look forward to what lies ahead.""

The settlement with NBC did not include a non-compete clause, meaning Bush ""is a free agent,"" said his lawyer, Marshall Grossman. Financial terms of the deal were kept confidential.

TMZ reports that Bush had just joined NBC's flagship show in August, signing a three-year deal for $3.5 million per year. He was tipped to receive millions in his settlement with NBC.

In the 2005 tape, which was first revealed by The Washington Post, Trump discusses unsuccessfully seeking an affair with another Access Hollywood employee, Nancy O'Dell. Trump said that when he was attracted to beautiful women ""I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet."" He said that when you're a star, women let you. ""Grab them by the p----. You can do anything,"" Trump added.

The two men discussed an actor who was waiting from at the end of the bus ride. When they got off, Bush urged the woman to hug Trump and added, ""how about a little hug for the Bushy?"" Trump said in the second presidential debate that he never did any of the actions heard on the tape, which he described as locker room talk. But a number of women have since come forward and said that Trump had surprised them in the past by groping or unexpectedly kissing them on the lips.

In an interview with CNN on Monday, Trump's wife, Melania, said that her husband was ""egged on"" by Bush in the conversation. ""I wonder if they even knew the mic was on,"" Melania Trump said, referring to her husband and Bush. She said they were involved in ""boy talk, and he was led on - like egged on - from the host to say dirty and bad stuff."" Asked to comment, Grossman said, ""I thought that Donald Trump would claim that he was not on the bus.""

The only notable good Sherman at the end of the war is the VC Firefly, but because US Ordinance doubted the 17 pounder could be fitted onto the tank, it was manufactured in limited quantities. 

The only notable features of the Sherman was that it was produced in large quantities, had a mechanical reliability that beat the T-34, and came with better secondary equipment such as FM Radio and an elevation gyro-stabiliser.

Not to mention the extremely sad stories behind it. Once, a Sherman maneuvered around a building to hide from a Tiger tank. The Tiger shot at the building, and the shell went right through and penetrated the Sherman's turret. There are also tales of German tanks who take out two aligned Shermans in one shot. Also, do you know why you see all these wartime photos of crewmen who have Shermans with spare road wheels and tracks welded onto the hull?

2633,"Blue Ivy To Play Nurse For Pregnant Mom Beyoncé

When Beyoncé goes into labor, she’ll have one very special helper by her side: 5-year-old daughter Blue Ivy!

According to an insider, the superstar and hubby Jay Z have agreed to let Blue play nurse

when the singer gives birth to twins, which the insider claims will happen via C-section in June

“Blue will be one of the first to hold the babies, with help from Jay, of course,

and she’ll be responsible for writing down their height and weight,” shares the insider.

“She’ll even get to help tie the ID bracelets on their wrists.”

Though some might be hesitant to have a child in the operating room,

Bey and Jay “want to make Blue feel included in anything related to bringing the twins into the world,” the insider says.

“She’s excited — and they don’t want her to be jealous.” Paging Nurse Blue!

2529,"Anorexic Angelina Jolie Wasting Away

Angelina Jolie’s rail-thin figure is prompting close pals to call for an intervention to save her from death!

“She’s refusing to eat!” one concerned insider told The National ENQUIRER. “Angie weighs just 82 pounds and looks absolutely anorexic. If something isn’t done soon, she’ll waste away to nothing!

“There’s no meat on her bones, her eyes are sunken into their sockets and her arms and legs are achingly skinny!”

PHOTOS: Wasting Away! Angelina Jolie Skinnier Than Ever In Shocking New Photos

Angie’s skeletal frame at the L.A. premiere of “Kung Fu Panda 3” on Jan. 16 shocked fans everywhere.

Now it’s time for her loved ones, including husband Brad Pitt, to act!

“They need to make Angie understand the dire straits she’s in,” the insider said. “Her health situation is going from serious to dire!”

Added Franci Cohen, a New York City nutritionist: “If she keeps pushing boundaries, her body will shut completely down without further warning.”

After viewing pics of Angie at the event, Dr. Art Mollen of the Mollen Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., said he’d “immediately” admit a person in her condition to an inpatient behavioral treatment center.

“This requires a multi-disciplined approach including psychiatrists, cardiologists, nutritionists and even the family to save the person’s life,” Dr. Mollen noted.

“Anyone who has a significantly low body weight like this and consistently abuses their body in this way can cause his or herself major harm,” he explained.

Her prognosis “would have to be guarded at best. Any time I see a person suffering with what appears to be anorexia, there are deep-seated problems, whether it’s in the marriage or elsewhere.”

Angie, 40, has continually ignored her health as she focuses on her career and humanitarian work, as The ENQUIRER has reported.

PHOTOS: How Will The Stars Look As Time Goes By

But Angie refuses to “slow down her hectic lifestyle” — although docs have told her she could be a prime candidate to develop cancer if she doesn’t look after her health — and even warned her, “You will die!” — a source said.

The mom of six underwent a preventive double mastectomy in 2013. She’s since also had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.

Those surgeries forced her body into early menopause — putting her at a greater risk of a wide array of life-threatening ailments, including cardiovascular and neurological diseases.

“Sometimes she goes a full day without eating a solid meal, and other days sleeps until late afternoon because she’s so worn out,” said one worried pal.

Another source said: “She looks incredibly gaunt, her skin is practically translucent. Her hair has thinned out. She looks terribly ill.”

Medical expert Dr. Stuart Fischer said he believes Angie is suffering from cachexia, a wasting syndrome that can dramatically increase the chance of death from an underlying condition.

Brad, 52, is alarmed by his wife’s appearance, sources said, and has consulted with therapists, dietitians and other experts to help Angie. But she refuses to slow down or take care of herself — even though she’s so underweight she suffers dizzy spells!

“He’s at the end of his rope,” a source said.

It’s time for Angie’s nearest and dearest to stage an intervention, and convince her to get help — before it’s too late — insiders said.

2523,"Selena Gomez Is ‘Crazy In Love’ With Justin After Reuniting: She’s ‘Light & Joyful’

If Selena Gomez seems like she’s living her best life since reuniting with Justin Bieber — she is! We’ve got the EXCLUSIVE that Sel’s in ‘love’ and happy to be back with Biebs.


Are Selena Gomez, 25, and Justin Bieber, 23, the new Beyonce and JAY-Z? To Sel, they are because like JAY and Bey, a Selena insider EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that she’s “just so crazy in love with Justin.” Aww. How sweet. Jelena may not cover Bey and JAY’s iconic 2003 hit, “Crazy In Love,” anytime soon, but Selena’s living the song 24/7. She’s even changing the minds of doubters and haters, all with the power of her love.

“As much as people around her are worried that she’ll end up heartbroken all over again, it’s hard not to be happy for her,” the source tells HollywoodLife.com. “She tried her best to put things with him behind her and for a long time it seemed like she had. But it’s obvious now that she was carrying a heavy weight around with her this whole time. Now that she’s back with Justin that weight has lifted, she just seems very light and joyful.”

It seems that Justin feels the same way, as he’s reportedly working on being a “better person” for Selena. Justin, who notoriously left Selena’s heart broken in two in the past, is reportedly changing his ways to make her happy, which in turn, makes them both happy. He’s even supposedly considering settling down with Selena in the future. Of course, before he could even consider getting down on one knee, Selena needs to convince her family and friends that he’s legit. Considering the Biebs was absent from the Selena Gomez family Thanksgiving, he may have a ways to go on that.

Selena Gomez​ reacts to The Weeknd​ going on a dinner date with Katy Perry​.
 
Plus, Selena’s fans may need to find their chill over this Jelena reunion. Justin reportedly “unliked” a photo of Selena’s blonde makeover, which caused Selenators to demand she dump him. Gasp! High treason! (Kidding.) Yeah, calling for these two split seems a bit harsh for a social media slip-up, right? Considering how much Selena is “in love” with Justin, perhaps her fans could relax a bit?

Do you think Justin and Selena are going to last, HollywoodLifers? Do you think these two will get hitched or will they end up breaking up, again?

But, the resulting view seems to imply bias in your preceding considerations.

It also seems that you've excused Roux for some of the behaviour you admonish me for (not to say I feel I should be excused from anything I've done).
If I may express my opinion, Roux is a good editor, but generally only when working alone or without opposition or critique; yes, I bare my own biases, but I come to that conclusion having seen his interactions with others in addition to my own experiences, and recent events seem to show that it isn't changing. It is my sense that in these circumstances he genuinely believes himself to be a victim, and, seemingly sensing some threat, responds to the most gentle criticism with the most vicious vitriol. While that can cause some problem in itself, the preverbal shit hits the fan when thrown into the mix are stubborn individuals who don't buy his claims of innocence and casualty, after which the intensity of the conflict increases exponentially. If it wasn't already obvious: I am one of those stubborn persons, believing we alone are responsible for our own actions. Thus, I honestly don't for one minute buy that Roux was """"driven"""" to do anything; he chose to participate here in the manners that he did, both good and bad, and he chose to leave; just as I chose to participate in the manners that I did, chose to leave, chose to come back, chose to leave again, chose to come back, and choose to admit much of my editing habits were the wrong way to go about things.

2838,"Kim Kardashian Opens Up to About Life After the Paris Robbery

This morning, Kim Kardashian West is a few minutes late to breakfast because she can’t get this gel-mask thing off her face. She’s staying in a room in the upper reaches of the Baccarat Hotel in midtown Manhattan. A room with a giant bed in it, in which she slept, butt to butt, with her four-year-old daughter, North. And in that room she applied a mask — of the cosmetic variety, not the Halloween variety — only to discover she couldn’t really get it off. Where did she get this gold gel-mask thing that’s supposed to make your skin healthier? Man, when you’re Kim Kardashian West, you don’t know where everything comes from. People just give you stuff. The vaults and doors and express-delivery accounts of the world open and a free flow of stuff just washes over you. Kim tries to enjoy it, because that’s the enlightened thing to do. But right now she’s upstairs in her room trying to separate her face from the free gel-mask thing.

It is 8 a.m. I wait for her in the sumptuous lobby. Baccarat, for those who do not shop for $10,000 vases, is a French company that makes crystal. And being inside the Baccarat Hotel is like being inside a fine crystal lamp where an urbane French genie who wears Louis Vuitton suits lives. Here’s the kind of place it is: $46 from Le Menu du Petit Déjeuner at the Petit Salon in the hotel gets you two eggs, potatoes, bacon, juice, and…coffee! There is an actual crown on display on a shelf full of curios and crystals, unless it’s the world’s most bejeweled serving dome.

But Kim K. does not make me wait too long. Seven minutes after 8, she arrives. She looks somehow naked. Her face, anyway. It is scrubbed clean, I guess from the mask removal. There is a stunning absence of makeup, except for some lip balm that she tells me she got in Iceland. Which is ironic given that the 36-year-old recently launched her own makeup line (it’s called KKW Beauty ). Predictably, she has utterly crushed the stuff-for-your-face market the way she has crushed all other markets. I think part of the reason her facial nudity is so striking is that being simple and unadorned isn’t really her role. Her role is more queen of America . (Married to the king of…hip-hop fashion, intellectual provocation, and possible public-­insanity performance art?) Queen of Instagram, queen of a certain type of television, queen of relevance. The queen of Calabasas, California! Which, if you don’t know, is the Mount Olympus of our time. Will Smith lives there. And Justin Bieber and Drake and the Rock and the Osbournes. And if you think about who’s the queen of those people, wouldn’t you say Kim Kardashian West?

I know, you’re probably wondering what she was wearing. You’re probably saying to yourself: What did she eat for breakfast? I’m not going to make you wait for it. She wears this cool, Rocky Balboa retro gray cotton hoodie with the 1980 American Olympic team logo on it and gray sweatpants. And she orders scrambled eggs with tomatoes, mushrooms, and onions mixed in, an English muffin, and some English breakfast tea with loads of honey. Did she eat everything? Don’t be afraid to wonder. If you don’t care whether Kim Kardashian West ate her English muffin, you need to go back to Kim Kardashian West school so you can appreciate the wonderful granular gossipyness that’s part of what’s so enjoyable about knowing everything about Kim K. before you come back here with your too-good-to-want-to-know-if-she-eats-her-English-muffin-ness.

“I’m, like, the most fit I’ve ever been,” she says. How do you get in shape if you’re Kim K.? The same way you do everything: Instagram. You go and you find “this bodybuilder on Instagram” and you contact her. You find someone who, as Kim K. tells it, “had an amazing transformation after she had a baby.” And Kim K. happened to be in the market for a really amazing transformation after giving birth. Now Kim’s working out an hour and a half a day.

Kim Kardashian West — I don’t want to scandalize you — has had her picture taken nearly naked before. For Playboy . And completely nude for Paper, GQ, and W magazines. And that doesn’t even include the original document of her fame, the storied Ray J sex tape. “My publicist would say to me, ‘You’re not getting naked. I have to be there,’ ” she says. I suggest that if your publicist keeps warning you not to get naked, she must know you’re always in danger of getting naked.

Is there an age limit for the naked photo shoot?

“Yes,” she says. “I’m like, I’m going to tone it down. But then I’m like, Wait, I can’t be doing it in 10 years, so — I might as well. I don’t know what the age cutoff is.”

We know everything about Kim Kardashian West. She has shown us everything. Talked about everything. Many times. In different languages. Kim has talked about basketball, and baby poop, and having no idea where pickles come from, and the texture of cardboard, and Kanye, and Caitlyn Jenner , and her sister’s boyfriend’s drug problems. Recently, on her show, we even watched her share the story of how difficult her pregnancy and birthing process was and how she’s looking at some alternatives to carrying her next kid herself. Have you ever considered, besides the solipsism, the bravery in that? You know the unflinching way she takes off her top in front of a camera? Or wears a $75 billion dress? That’s how unflinchingly she talks about the fragility of her own human body. It’s feminist. It’s a PSA. Here, in this glass-enclosed beveled luxury maze, while wealthy French businessmen finish eating their $46 toast, I ask if she’s thought about a third child. And she retains this unblinking steady-state feline eye contact and a sense of self-assurance that could freeze water while she says, “I would like to, but I’ve had lots and lots of complications. I had preeclampsia. And then I also had something called placenta accreta. We’ve explored surrogacy. We’re thinking about it.”

I get the vibe from her that, just as she has the crushing instincts necessary to lay waste to our culture and create an America in her image (or is it that she’s created America’s image?), she also has the instinct to preserve the humanity of her family.

“We don’t do gifts,” she says when I ask her if she worries about her kids growing up with too much. “[Kanye and I] talk about it all the time, about not getting too much and trying to be as grounded and well rounded as possible.” She holds herself to the same standard. “I don’t like presents anymore,” she says. “We just did absolutely nothing [for our anniversary]. We spent two days in Santa Barbara, and we slept.” Then she remembers: “You know what? I think we went to IHOP. That’s what we did.”

And then she tells me this story. A motherhood story. It’s about the time last year, in Paris, when she was held at gunpoint and bound and robbed in a hotel by masked gunmen. Well, she tells me, she’d been scared to go on that trip. She was afraid of a terrorist attack. She’d never experienced anxiety like that before. She even went to a therapist about it. And North, sensing her mother’s anxiety, wanted to reassure her.

“She gave me a little plastic treasure box, and she put her little jewels in it — like fake little plastic jewels — and she was like, ‘Mommy, this will keep you safe when you go to Paris.’ ” It is something that, despite all the jewels and Calabasas houses and red carpet gowns and original Basquiats and Rolls-Royces and pairs of Yeezy boots she has, penetrates down into the depths of Kim Kardashian West’s humanity, which, at least after spending a few hours with her, I believe is very much there.

“To have something really sweet like that is more important to me than all the jewelry,” she says. She tells me she takes it everywhere with her.

Around us, European businessmen sign their checks, step into hushed elevators and are whisked to meetings with continental vampires. Kim K. says she’s going to see what North is up to. I’m trying to figure out what’s weird about seeing her in person, at this phase of her life. And I think it’s that she wears her crown lightly. I guess it’s that she’s chill. Which doesn’t seem like the one word you’d use for Kim K. I guess it’s that she’s really a mom now. She is a beautiful, worldly 36-year-old woman drinking the last of a cup of English breakfast tea before going out into the world to see to her empire, with her four-year-old child at her side, bearing witness to the domination but never expecting, you know, presents.

= My Famous Article ==witze  happiness − wikipedia The Witzeman is a great honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families, regardless of race, age, character or knowledge. The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.

The Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.

                           History
The present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.

                       Proper History
As early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.",0

2557,"Chelsea Handler Has Nothing Nice to Say About Ben Affleck (EXCLUSIVE)

Hoes over bros! Apparently, comedian Chelsea Handler takes that mantra to heart because she is ready to tear into her best friend, Jennifer Garner's ex, Ben Affleck. The 42-year-old is 100 percent #TeamJen in the Ben/Jen split — and honestly, can you blame her? In Touch has the exclusive scoop on what exactly Chelsea has in store for the Argo star.


Sources say Chelsea ""is foaming at the mouth wanting to publicly unload on her good friend’s lying and cheating estranged husband, Ben."" During a July 12 dinner with Jen (at the same restaurant where Ben took Lindsay six days earlier), ""Chelsea was focused on getting Jen’s blessing to go after Ben.""

Much to Chelsea's disappointment, we're sure, it looks like her takedown of Ben is going to need to be put on hold. Understandably, Jen doesn't want any more unnecessary attention on her family. The source continues, ""But while Jen is extremely appreciative, she isn’t comfortable with it. She thinks it will just create more drama.”

This behavior isn't surprising coming from Chelsea. She was incredibly vocal about her support of friend Jennifer Aniston after her very public split from ex-husband, Brad Pitt.

While appearing on Watch What Happens Live she was asked what she'd do if ever stuck in an elevator with Angelina Jolie. ""I would just look up,” the late night host said. “Exactly what people do in elevators. You know when you fake look at the number because you don’t want to make eye contact. That would be exactly the elevator ride. And then I’d go, ‘Heyyy’ as I walked out. ‘Hey you.’”

Ouch — we can't wait to see what Chelsea has in store for Ben!

Kanye West Enraged Taylor Swift Referenced Kim Kardashian’s Robbery In Music Video

Kanye West was emotionally unaffected by Taylor Swift’s ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ video… until she seemingly referenced Kim Kardashian’s 2016 Paris robbery. The rapper thinks it was a pretty low thing for Taylor to do.


Kanye West, 40, isn’t too happy that Taylor Swift, 27, targeted Kim Kardashian‘s Paris robbery situation in her music video for “Look What You Made Me Do”, HL has EXCLUSIVELY learned. “He was upset that Taylor exploited Kim’s robbery,” a source close to the rapper explains. “Kanye feels like that was not cool because the incident was a very serious and dangerous situation.” Ultimately, Ye’ “just feels as though it’s something that Taylor shouldn’t have mocked.”


As for the rest of the video? — Well, Kanye could care less. He and Kim, 36, weren’t bothered by the cryptic messages in the video that the internet consumed themselves with, trying to dissect. However, it was that one very sensitive topic that had the couple upset. As you may know, Kim was robbed of her multi-million dollar, 20-carat engagement ring, at gunpoint in Oct. 2016; as well as other personal items. The traumatic experience caused Kim longterm emotional struggles, which she still deals with to this day.

However, she’s admitted that the robbery was “meant” to happen to her. “I know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me,” Kim said through tears on Ellen [April, 2017]. “I know that was so meant to happen to me. I’m such a different person … I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things.”

In case [for some reason] you didn’t watch Taylor’s “Look What You Made Me Do” music video, we can help you decode the whole assumed robbery reference. At one point in the extremely cryptic video, Taylor lays in a bathtub, filled with diamonds.

When Kim was robbed, she said she was attacked in her Paris apartment and taken to the bathroom after she was tied up and gagged.

Then, Taylor makes a gun-notion with her hand and pretends to cock it back with her hands.

Kim was robbed at gunpoint.

Later on in the video, Taylor, along with a group of accomplices, all wearing cat masks and hoodies, are seen viciously tearing through a closet, while stuffing money into bags.

When Kim was robbed, she described the scene as French men rummaging through her things, looking for money, jewelry and other lavish belongings of hers.

So, was Taylor really mocking the traumatic experience Kim endured? You can be the judge of that one. However, we’ve decoded the video [seen above] to give you a clearer look at Tay’s new work.

 Camille Paglia: sex-positive feminist 

Here are the supporting links you asked for, you stupid twit!

http://www.lotl.com/content/paglia.htm

http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism

If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here:

Camille Paglia: """"On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."""" 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a """"respectable"""" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.""",1

You know what, forget it. The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil. How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are """"unencyclopedic"""", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than """"unencyclopedic"""", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.

That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.""",0

Response to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann

I reverted your edit because you give partial information, not because of the  wording I prefer. What parts do not make sense? The ones you deleted that says there is a joint working group? Stop saying it is bad English, if it was just that you'd fix it without removing information.

""""Garcia added that when the PJ is criticized then the British police are also criticized because of their close cooperation"""" What you wrote does not make sense and it is a bad summary of the Portuguese article:

1-  It is not just close cooperation, it was created a joint working group right from the start with the British police. This is why the British police are also criticized. Just close cooperation they have with the Interpol, the Europol and other police organizations. No working group was created with them. I hope it is clear.
 
2- Several unfair critics were made to the  methodology used by the Portuguese police. Garcia defends that the number of abductions that results in murder is a decisive factor that determines the different investigation methodologies adopted by Portuguese and British police. 
Other facts indirectly related to the different methodology:

3-Personnel attacks were made to police officers because of the different methodology used referred to as """"forging evidence"""": """"He [Gonçalo Amaral] was the victim of personal attacks by the British media which not only questioned his honour as a policeman, but also attacked him as a human being."""" 

4- Portugal has 9 unsolved cases of missing children under 18 (including Madeleine).
In spite of all the resources available and the different methodology, the UK has 124 unsolved cases of missing children under 14, in the last four years.(National Missing Persons Bureau).  
It seems that the British  methodology alone was not enough to solve these cases. Besides this:

5-The UK has a serious problem with child trafficking  

6-A serious problem with African children that just go missing: 

5- No criticism was ever made to the lack of results of the investigation of the Control Risks Group, hired by the Mcanns since May. """"The investigation [of the PJ], we've stated all along, has the most likely chance of us finding her"""" Something made them change their minds?

The use of a different methodology is not only used because there are very few cases where the abducted child dies, Portugal does not have the kind of serious problems with children's abduction and trafficking that the UK has. 
I hope it was clearly written and the """"parts of it do not make sense"""" start to make sense.

so far...

CorpseFucking Art (C.F.A.) are an Brutal Death Metal/ deathgrind band, from  Italy formed in 1993. Their lyrics focuses mainly on gore and Humor.

Biography

The band was formed in Rome in 1993. With the first line-up (Max - gurgling, Andrea - guitars, Fabio - bass, Marco - drums) under a different name Enthralment and recorded their first demo called Eulogy Of Burning Christ. The official sound was a slow and brutal death-metal influenced by Immolation and Incantation.

Cryptic Soul Productions signed Enthralment released the 7"""" Accursed In Divinity. However. the sound contained in the new tracks were defenitely more brutal oriented. As the musical direction was no longer the same as the beginning, it was useless to keep the old name. The one choosen for this new form of madness was Corpsegod. With a different name but same line-up, they recorded in 1995 the mini cd Opinion About Sorrow released by Torture Records. The mini cd contained 5 tracks of original and strange brutal death-metal. Ultrabrutal riffing with techno and industrial parts, splatter movies - Opinion About Sorrow a really vanguard record compared to the others on the death-metal scene.

Though, the passion for the ultrabrutal death-metal in the band was getting higher and higher. The old line-up went to create a new band totally devoted to the brutal death-metal without compromises. A new band was born then, Corpsefucking Art. From the old line-up Andrea and Max were still there. After recording a 2 tracks promo with the new line up (Massimo - guitar, Marcello - drums, Edo - bass) and the track Molesting The Corpse for the underground splatter movie Sick-o-pathic soundtrack. The band played as support for Cannibal Corpse and Immolation for a show in Rome. Corpsefucking Art recorded their debut CD named A Puzzle Of Flesh for the italian label Sterminio Productions. Nine tracks of blasting ultrabrutal death-metal without mercy. An inhuman voice and a blasting riffing made A Puzzle Of Flesh known in the underground.

In 2001 the line-up changed again. Andrea the only member from the first line up joined up with Marco (bass) and Stuart (drums). They recorded a new split CD with Goretrade Zombiecronomicon distributed by Coagulated Records. In april 2002, United Guttural Records took the license by Coagulated records and restamped the split cd with Goretrade, released with a completely new artwork.

After being offered a contract by Forever Underground, Corpsefucking Art entered the studio to record their new full length Splatter Deluxe with the new second guitarist Marco Riccardi. Between the recording and the long wait to the new cd to be out, the band takes part in a lot of live performances including festival in Frankfurt with Lividity, Gorerotted, Inhumate, Pigstry, Nunwhore Commando 666, Mastic Scum, Master and Damnable and the rest of Europe in places like Sweden, France and Italy. The band is currently, in 2008, recording a new studio album and is aspected to come out early 2009.

2427,"Kim Kardashian's 'Fears Will Explode' If Kanye West Runs For President: She's 'Very Nervous'

""Kanye [West]'s talking more and more about stepping into politics, but Kim [Kardashian] is extremely hesitant for him to go down that path. She's very nervous about the kind of hatred that would be focused on him and their family if he were to run for president. Before the robbery, she wasn't as scared, but now she lives in constant fear. If Kanye runs for president, those fears will explode,"" a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

We can totally understand why Kim would be so worried. If she thinks she's under a microscope now, just wait until she's First Lady. The haters would never stop coming for her. And Kim doesn't deserve that, especially after her Paris robbery in early October. That was scary enough!

We're not exactly sure what Kanye plans to do if he's elected President, but what we do know is that had he voted this year, he would have supported Donald Trump.

""I told y'all I didn't vote, right? But I didn't tell you, I guess I'll tell you, but if I were to vote, I would've voted Trump,"" he told concert goers on Nov. 17.

""There was things that I liked about Trump's campaign"" he added, before explaining this is the ""beginning of change.""

""Somethings that you might think are bad have to happen in order for change to f***ing happen,"" he told the crowd. ""Sometimes, you might have to not get your way to really understand what to do in the future to be able to get your way.""

2416,"Miley Cyrus Wedding Rumors: Will Miley Force Liam Hemsworth To Sign A Prenup?

Wedding rumors for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are heating up, and now many fans want to know if either party plans to protect their assets before tying the knot. Miley just happens to be worth about ten times as much as her Aussie beau and because of that, there are reports that she really wants Liam to sign a prenup before they walk down the aisle. Life & Style has reported that Miley's money demands have caused stress in her relationship with Liam, and that the couple is currently fighting about whether or not a prenup is even necessary.

Miley Cyrus is worth a whopping $160 million while Liam boasts just $16 million himself. Life & Style claims that Miley wants to set up a prenup to cover their combined $176 million as they head toward marriage. Apparently, it doesn't matter to Miley if everything about her relationship with Liam seems perfect right now. Cyrus is a shrewd business woman and she knows things can go south very quickly, just like they did in 2013. Miley wants to make sure that her money is safe even if her renewed romance with Liam doesn't stand the test of time.

""They've had heated arguments over this,"" a source told the magazine. ""He's a firm believer that prenups spoil the romance of a marriage and that if they are truly in love, it's not needed. He's assured Miley he isn't interested in her fortune and has enough money of his own.""

It's only fair that Miley ensures that her money is protected with a prenup in the event she does marry Liam. Cyrus is already toning down her over-the-top antics in order to make Hemsworth happy. It was Miley's wild ways that pushed Liam away the first time around. Now that Liam and Miley have grown closer, fans have noticed that her hair has grown much longer and Miley isn't acting out nearly as much as she was in past years.

On the other hand, Liam has realized that even if she is a little weird, Miley is the woman that he loves. While Miley has toned it down some, Liam is definitely meeting her in the middle and giving the singer some freedom to still express her true self.

After reports that Miley moved in with Liam, it looks like she also bought a house of her own. Us Magazine reports that Miley just put $2.5 million down on a 4-bedroom home in Malibu. ""The plan is for Liam to stay there while they reconnect, and then move in permanently when he's ready,"" a source close to Cyrus reportedly told the gossip site. It's unclear why Miley bought the home since it was reported that she was living with Liam, not far away. Now, the pair own a pair of Malibu homes. Could this be their way to get to know each other again without being together 24 hours a day?

So far, neither Miley nor Liam are talking about their reconciliation. Then again, they aren't hiding their love either. Ever since Miley was spotted in Australia during the New Year's holiday, she and Liam have been seen spending time together. There have even been reports that mutual friend Kellan Lutz congratulated the pair and headlines about Liam purchasing a new ring for Miley. Not to mention that Cyrus was seen sporting her old engagement ring in a few pictures on Instagram already.

Will the prenup continue to be an issue for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth? Fans hope not and many are excited that Miley has her man back. Let's just hope this new Miley is still fun and outrageous, and that Liam doesn't tame the entertainer so much that it hurts her career, if they can even squash the prenup issue and make it to the altar anyway.

From the Boston Globe:Lieberman, a Democrat who won reelection as an independent, also said he wants to be called an Independent Democrat.A strong backer of the Iraq war, Lieberman was returned to office on Election Day with strong GOP support. He ran as an independent after he lost the Democratic primary in August to Ned Lamont.He said yesterday on NBC's """"Meet the Press"""" that he will begin his new term as a Democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership. The senator is in line to become chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.""""I'm going to caucus with the Democrats both because it's good for my constituents in Connecticut, because I retained my seniority, I become a committee chair, but also I want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security, foreign policy, and innovation and progress in domestic policy,"""" Lieberman said.He said that because voters returned him to Capitol Hill as an independent, """"I am now an Independent Democrat  capital I, capital D. Matter of fact, the secretary of the Senate called my office and asked, 'How do you want to be identified,' and that's it.

And I can't say I enjoyed it, but we're all grown-ups, we've got a job to do, and I'm going to do my best to get that job done,"""" Lieberman said.Democrats will hold a 51-49 edge in the Senate, so Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2000, could find himself courted by Republicans.He was asked about the possibility that he might switch caucuses if he became uncomfortable as Democrats sought to enforce party discipline, particularly if the GOP offered to keep him as a committee chairman and respect his seniority.""""I'm not ruling it out, but I hope I don't get to that point. And, and I must say, and with all respect to the Republicans who supported me in Connecticut, nobody ever said, 'We're doing this because we, we want you to switch over,' """" he said.""""I believe that the American people are considering both major political parties to be in a kind of probation, because they're understandably angry that Washington is dominated too much by partisan political games, and not enough by problem-solving and patriotism, which means put the country and your state first,"""" Lieberman said.In 2001, Senator James Jeffords [Addition by Hodgdon's secret garden: (""""D."""")] of Vermont abandoned the GOP and aligned himself with the Democrats, putting them in control of the evenly divided Senate. The switch made him a hero among Democrats and a traitor among Republicans.Lieberman said Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia listed himself as an Independent Democrat in the late 1970s.

Hollywood actor George Clooney and wife Amal Clooney are reportedly spending more than $1 million to have a royal-like experience when Amal gives birth to their twins.

Earlier it was also reported that the 55-year-old actor had made a reservation for the entire Kensington wing at London’s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.

The hospital wing George has booked is said to cost up to $588,000 for a week’s stay.

Amal is also said to be flying in two “birth companions” from Los Angeles which cost $30,000 and an Italian masseuse who charges $5,000.

The couple is known to be generous with money.

Earlier this month, the couple was reportedly giving their neighbours a 45,000 pounds as compensation package for the noise caused by the renovations to their estate.

If Amal Alamuddin can bag George Clooney, so can we!

The package was said to include a holiday to Corfu, a six-week stay in a luxury hotel and a 30,000 pounds lump sum. In addition, the Clooneys paid for their neighbours to rent a 780,000 pounds cottage.

Jennifer Lawrence ended up naked in Kris Jenner's wardrobe after downing five martinis.

The Hunger Games actress recently went to the showbiz matriarch's house for dinner but things quickly escalated and she ended up stripping off in the 61-year-old star's closet and asking her daughter Kim Kardashian West, and the reality star's husband Kanye West, to dress her.

While interviewing Kim during a guest hosting stint on Jimmy Kimmel Live, she told the audience: ""I drank five martinis and wound up naked in her closet, I’m dead serious.""

Kim admitted the evening with the 27-year-old actress was the most under the influence she had ever seen her mother before.

She said: ""So Jennifer came over for dinner two weeks ago, I’ve never seen my mom more drunk in our lives. It was so funny. They had a few too many drinks for my taste.""

Kim - who has 22-month-old son Saint and four-year-old daughter North with the 40-year-old rapper - was shocked to see her pal ""fully butt naked"" in her mother's wardrobe.

Recalling the night, she explained: ""You said, ‘I’m not joking, I really want Kanye to style me,' and so I said, ‘OK.’

""I come back in and you’re fully butt naked. I feel like I know you so well now.""

But Jennifer was delighted with the results of Kim and Kanye's fashion advice, and admitted the evening ""was everything I could’ve ever dreamed of"".

She added: ""I remember getting naked in your mom’s closet and ordering you to dress me. You dressed me fabulously, I looked amazing.""

Jennifer is well known for being a huge fans of the Kardashians and is particularly friendly with momager Kris.

2701,"Moving fashion forward: Brooding Tom Hiddleston has a new blonde in his life as he poses with dog for suave Gucci campaign after Taylor Swift split

He's one of Hollywood's most debonair stars.

So it's little wonder that Gucci have recruited Tom Hiddleston to be the face of their Cruise 2017 campaign, which sees the star decked out in an array of suave tailoring.

Moving forward from his sudden split with Taylor Swift, the 35-year-old actor shows of his leading man credentials as he takes centre-stage in the retro-styled campaign.

Flanked by a retinue of Afghan hounds, the High-Rise star seemingly replaced one blonde with three loyal ones.

Never failing to impress with his sartorial styling on the red carpet, the actor only seems a natural choice for the campaign.

Cutting a dashing yet suitably brooding figure, Alessandro Michele's vision for the Italian fashion house's resurgent menswear collection sees the actor captured in a series of homely tableau.

In one picture The Night Manager star is seen in a languid repose on a green sofa, staring off into the distance as if a he was a million miles.

Wearing a burgundy three-piece suit, slim-fitting and with razor-sharp lines, the actor certainly looks every inch the urbane gent.

In another shot, Tom is seen stood in the midst of three hounds decked out in a dark windowpane check two piece, ready for a day at the office - or indeed having just returned home from it.

The series of colourful yet muted portraits show the Thor and Avengers actor in his element, a subtle yet commanding presence - who looks even better thanks to the tailoring.

The campaign comes just weeks after the his relationship with popstrel imploded, with sources close to each of the stars claiming each of them ended it on their own terms.

However, last week Tom put paid to any rumours of hard-feelings or feuding between the two as he said they had remained on amicable terms.

When asked by People at the Emmy Awards last week if him and Taylor had remained on friendly terms since the split he replied: 'Yes. Yes, we are,' with a smile.

2586,"Jim Carrey Claims Donald Trump Is A 'Reptilian-Illuminati Blood Prince'

Jim Carrey has told fans and supporters that Donald Trump is not human but is a “reptilian that shapeshifts between human and reptile form” and he has witnessed the president shapeshift “in the flesh, before my very eyes, and in my opinion, as personal warning to me.“

Speaking to supporters at the Signature Gallery in Las Vegas where he is hosting his first ever art exhibition, “Sunshower”, the beloved comedic actor dropped hints about the themes buried deep in his paintings.

“I am interested in what is behind the veil of reality, the real power structures that control the universe. I’m no longer interested in the daily facade. I’ve put everything I know into these paintings.”

Carrey first met Donald Trump at a boxing match held at the Trump Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City in the early 90s. A popular TV actor at the time, Carrey was criticized by Trump’s associates for “failing to entertain” the future president.

But according to Carrey, he was “avoiding him like the plague” because he witnessed Trump shapeshifting when he arrived at the venue.

“Donald Trump has a long reptile face, an oversized beak, and his scales are a disgusting grey color, like sewer water,” Carrey said.

Explaining that Donald Trump shapeshifted between this state and his human form “at least three times” while greeting him, Carrey claims that he also saw Trump shapeshifting while greeting other celebrity guests.

“His hands turned into scaly reptile hands while he gesticulated at random acquired objects he deemed beautiful or valuable. When he smiled his teeth changed into razor sharp reptile teeth and glistened like jewel-encrusted daggers.”

“It wasn’t just me. I’m not going to name names, but these secrets are well known in certain circles, among those in the know.“

Carrey says he believes Trump shapeshifted while greeting him as a show of strength and a warning not to mess with the dominant reptilian-political Illuminati of which he is a “blood prince.”

“This branch of the Illuminati, the most powerful branch, they come from Bavaria,” Carrey said, explaining that “Bavaria is Trump’s ancestral homeland.”

Asked if he had proof of his claims, Carrey told his supporters to “watch what happens when these issues get raised in the media. The gatekeepers will try to deny I said these things. When that doesn’t work, they will try and destroy my reputation.”

Carrey also told his fans and supporters to “look deeply” at his artworks to “decipher their real meaning.”

“There are some things you can’t say, but you can paint. I have put everything I know into those paintings.“

“It’s 1am, I’m eating goldfish and talking about reptilianism with new friends. I’ve never felt more at peace,” Carrey said.

Carrey’s first hand experiences with the reptilian-Illuminati chime with my own research and second hand accounts.  I have dedicated the last five years to researching the elusive, tyrannical powers that rule our world, travelling to over 80 countries, and it never ceases to amaze me how many people from very different walks of life have told me stories about seeing ‘people’ briefly turn into reptilians before their very eyes.

I’ve been told this by Californian news anchors, Ethiopian goatherds, and Australian Aboriginals, just to name a few.  A Danish taxi driver described driving past a group of VIP guests at the 2014 Bilderberg meeting in Copenhagen and seeing some of their faces turn reptilian and some of their hands and feet take on a reptilian look.

In Peru a respected psychic told me she sees people in power, like Obama, David Cameron and Hillary Clinton, turn into reptiles whenever she watches an international news channel.

The world’s ruling class have tyrannical control over the mainstream media, as well as our food, water, and air supply, and they are actively dumbing down the masses.  The evidence against them, ancient and modern, is enormous and continuing to grow.

A small edit: In the “Reception” section (formerly “Dickinson and Her Critics”), Susanne Juhasz is paraphrased as offering essays from a “female"""" perspective (from her book Feminist Critics Read Emily Dickinson). Historically speaking, I wasn’t aware there was a “female” outlook on any matter. I’ve never doubted there was a “feminist perspective”, however. 

If a “female” point-of-view has been established as biologically - or socially - predetermined, kindly provide the scientific evidence for this phenomenon. Until then, I’ve changed the entry to “a feminist perspective.”

For this tour, Jay-Z will use an in-the-round configuration, where the stage will be at the middle of the arena floor, with seating on all sides.

The rapper/music industry mogul’s personal life has frequently brought him to New Orleans in recent years. In February, he visited the Smoothie King Center to watch the 2017 NBA Allstar Game with his wife, Beyoncé, and the couple’s oldest daughter, Blue Ivy. He has also accompanied Beyoncé on numerous trips to the Crescent City to visit her sister, Solange Knowles.

But he has also graced New Orleans stages on a fairly regular basis. Mostly recently, he came to town to perform with Beyoncé at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome during their ""On the Run"" joint tour in July 2014.

Prior to that he appearance, he and Kanye West filled what was then called the New Orleans Arena for their ""Watch the Throne"" co-headlining tour in December 2011.

On his own, Jay-Z headlined the arena in February 2010 during the tour for his “The Blueprint 3.” On that tour, he performed with a live, 10-piece backing band.

He also hit the arena in April 2008 on the ""Heart of the City"" tour with Mary J. Blige. He and R. Kelly brought their ill-fated ""Best of Both Worlds"" show to the arena in October 2004. Jay-Z also sold out the arena in August 2003 during his ""Rock the Mic"" tour with 50 Cent and Busta Rhymes.

""4:44,"" Jay-Z's first album in four years, is being described as his most personal and thoughtful. It released via his Roc Nation label in late June initially as an exclusive download for Sprint customers and Tidal subscribers. As of July 7, the album is available in physical form and from other streaming services.

The ""4:44"" tour launches in Anaheim, California, on Oct. 27 and concludes Dec. 21 at The Forum in Los Angeles.

2624,"Beyonce's Officially Gone Overboard With Her CRAZY Delivery Plan Demands & Here's Why

There’s no denying that Beyonce is one of Hollywood’s biggest diva’s but new sources suggest her demands just got even crazier. In anticipation of the arrival of their beloved twins, the singer and her husband Jay-Z have concocted a delivery plan so insane you’d think they’re royalty. On the heels of reports that the famous couple have moved to a rental property close to Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sinai hospital, where Bey’s due to give birth, insiders tell Heat magazine that “the event is set to be a no-expense-spared extravaganza.” Click through to get the scoop inside Beyonce’s delivery room plans, and how the couple’s daughter, Blue Ivy, will have a very peculiar role in the process.

“Bey and Jay want three suites in the hospital- they only had one for Blue. This will give their people space and allow for security, who are needed because people will inevitably try to sneak in and take pictures of the twins,” a source tells the tabloid. Understandably, the duo are “not taking any chances.” BT45tW4A8mR

And what’s more is that the famous parents have asked their five-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, to help deliver the twins. “Beyonce has decided Blue will be part of the delivery process to make sure she’s not jealous of her new siblings. Blue has her own birth plan written up, and will be staying in the room throughout. She’s set to be the first person to hold the babies after the doctor handing them to Jay-Z.” BTrg0rEg9gY

The insider continues, “Blue’s got $1,200 Givenchy nurse’s outfit, and a notepad to write down the twins’ weights. She will also help to tie the identification bracelets on their wrists.” Sources tell the outlet that Blue “isn’t nervous about seeing her mum give birth – quite the opposite. She’s really excited.” BTN6tgmAC-W

Once the twins are born, they’ll undoubetedly be some of the most richest babies in the world, and the couple will do whatever it takes to protect them. “The twins’ protection is paramount, and word is they’ve hired ten security guards for each one. They won’t all work at once, but there will always be at least two each around the clock. The cost is a couple of million dollars a year, easily.” BSXePJMga6x

Wow! What do you think of Beyonce’s delivery plan demands? Sound off in the comments! BRzJh3OAnBA

2498,"Scientology Showdown! Katie Holmes & Jenna Elfman Caught In Awkward 'GMA' Run-In

For once, the drama at Good Morning America wasn't involving Robin Roberts and her new arch-nemesis, Michael Strahan.

RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that devote Scientologist Jenna Elfman had Katie Holmes cowering in fear  behind the scenes when the two both appeared on the Mar. 29 broadcast.

""Jenna was doing the show live to promote her new ABC show,"" Imaginary Mary, revealed an onset source. ""She was happy and charming and the audience loved her.""

Too bad another scheduled GMA guest wasn't so thrilled to see her!

""Backstage Katie was terrified,"" the source noted to Radar of Holmes, who was on the show to talk about reprising her role as Jacqueline Kennedy. ""She was literally hiding from her and she seemed scared.""

""They had to change Katie's dressing room because she wanted to be nowhere near the famous Scientologist,"" the onset source added.

As Radar has reported, in the past, Elfman has been known to denounce those who denounced Scientology.

""It was one of the ugliest and nastiest things I've ever seen a human being do and to this day I just can't stand her,"" recalled one former Scientologist who left the church and claimed Elfman confronted her.

Holmes, 38, was labeled a suppressive person and shunned by the Scientology community, including 45-year-old Elfman, following her bitter divorce from the religion's highest star-powered devotee, Tom Cruise.

""Katie got out of the religion and knows everything, and she wants nothing to do with Scientology,"" an insider explained of the awkward morning show situation.

Thankfully for Holmes, said the onset source, ""producers choreographed everything to make sure both guest felt safe and comfortable.""

2678,"Taylor Swift's camp denies that singer is launching her own streaming service

A source close to Taylor Swift has reportedly denied suggestions that the singer is set to launch her own streaming service.

Swift's uneasy relationship with streaming services is well noted. In 2014, she pulled her music from Spotify, arguing that ""the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace"". She later allowed Apple Music to exclusively stream her '1989' album after they changed their royalty policy following a critical open letter she posted.

TMZ recently reported that Swift filed documents to trademark a 'Swifties', what they described as a streaming service ""featuring non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings"".

However, a source from Swift's camp has since told Billboard that the singer ""would not be launching a streaming service"". Instead, the report suggests that Swifties would be more ""like a personalized fan club app complete with exclusive merchandise, audio/video/live performances and the possibility of a mobile game of some sort"".

Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran appears to have let slip the release date of Taylor Swift's new album. There had previously been rumours that Swift would release a new album in October 2016. However, no album surfaced last autumn. The singer-songwriter had previously released each of her five albums every two years in either October or November, with her last record '1989' released in October 2014.

It was also reported last year that Taylor Swift had recruited Drake to help her make an album of ""edgier R&B and hip-hop sounds"".  Swift is also rumoured to be working on new music with Kesha.

2480,"Face Lift, Botox, Peels, Oh My! Ellen DeGeneres' Plastic Surgery Obsession Revealed

Ellen DeGeneres' obsession with staying forever young is written all over her face  – literally! In a new report from The National ENQUIRER, sources reveal that the down-to-earth talk show queen is really a plastic surgery junkie in disguise.

And according to insiders, her much-younger gorgeous wife Portia de Rossi is her inspiration for the drastic measures.

""She's had plastic surgery,"" one TV mole told the mag. ""I think she's had it before and it's all because she's unhappy about looking older – especially when compared to Portia [de Rossi]!""

And, according to another behind-the-scenes snitch, her glowing appearance isn't just TV magic.

""She had a lift and still gets Botox! She drives her hair and makeup staff nuts!"" continued the source.

A production insider revealed the challenges her glam team face when it comes to concealing scarring due to the work she's had done: ""It usually takes them about two-and-a-half hours to give Ellen that peaches-and-cream glow her fans love,"" said the source.

So just what has she had done?

Top plastic surgeons examined photos of the comedienne and say the CoverGirl spokeswoman appears to have a multitude of procedures, including face-, eye-, neck- and brow-lifts.

""There is a dramatic change that made her look somewhat different,"" leading NYC cosmetic surgeon Dr. Yoel S. Shahar, who has not treated DeGeneres, told The ENQUIRER. ""To achieve such a change she needed to have multiple procedures. It is quite obvious she underwent a full facelift that improved her neck and jawline. No injectable like Botox can create such a change.""

""She also appeared to have had a forehead lift, elevating her eyebrows significantly in addition to Botox injections eliminating the wrinkles at the crow's feet, glabella and forehead,"" Dr. Shahar continued.

And if that wasn't enough, DeGeneres' journey to find the fountain of youth allegedly didn't end there.

Dr. Shahar suggested the 56-year-old appears to have had upper and lower blepharoplasty, which ""smooth and improve the eyelid, giving her a youthful look.

""It seems obvious to me that she also had fillers under her eyes and skin care by chemical or laser peel,"" Dr. Shahar claimed. ""Overall, I believe she's undergone successful surgical and nonsurgical procedures that made her look her best.""

Famed cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Kenneth Mark, who has not treated the Emmy Award-winning TV host, added: ""She has been transformed from having a frown face with sunken cheeks under her eyes and jowls with prominent marionette lines to now looking alive and well!""

DeGeneres, who tied the knot with 41-year-old glamorous actress de Rossi in 2008, is a household name for her effortless chic, which according to the show insider is all just an act.

""She pretends not to care about her appearance to the world but in reality, she's obsessed with plastic surgery  – and a sucker for new cosmetic procedures and products,"" said the source.

854,"I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to pass your articles as GA, because frankly, they suck. But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA.

First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.

There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.

Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.
You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.
The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.

Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",1

There’s the Angelina Jolie who’s now a single mother—managing the day-to-day chaos of six kids, and the trauma of her split from Brad Pitt—and there’s the Angelina Jolie whose latest movie, a groundbreaking Netflix original about Cambodia’s genocide, is also a thank-you to the nation that transformed her. At her new L.A. mansion, Jolie reveals the tension between the two Angelinas and the reason her life will never be normal.

Like most things involving Angelina Jolie, stepping foot into her house is an experience so heightened one wonders if it’s for real or the product of careful orchestration. The large gates to her recently purchased Los Feliz house—an 11,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts mansion once owned by the epic filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille—slowly swing open, revealing rolling lawns, lush trees at the perimeter. No one’s there, and all is quiet except for the delicate sound of fountains, arched in a row over a swimming pool. A number of doors to the house are open, as if posing some riddle from a fairy tale—which one to enter? Inside, the vibe is airy and calm: all open windows and cross-breezes, creamy-white unlit candles, soft creamy-white furnishings. Finally she emerges from the other side of the house and glides across the room in a creamy-white, floor-length caftan. Her hair is down, her feet bare, only a touch of makeup, her skin luminous. She smiles widely—a beneficent, ethereal wood nymph. But as soon as she starts speaking, you realize that your preconceived notions about Jolie aren’t quite right. She’s not a celestial goddess. She’s not the high-and-mighty do-gooder. She’s not the intense control freak—or at least not obviously so. She comes across, rather, as normal-person friendly and practical, even chitchatty. She explains the deal with the big empty mansion. She moved into this space just four days ago with her six kids. It wasn’t for the prestigious history or the architecture. She needed a good place fast, somewhere secluded, with a lot of rooms; this one, which was listed for around $25 million, has six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms. Following her September 2016 filing for divorce from Brad Pitt, she and her children spent nine months in a rental, basically living out of suitcases. And so she hasn’t really unpacked, barely knows her way around the place, has never had a real visitor, and isn’t sure where the best spot is to sit and talk. With that in question, she roams from room to room—the fabulous kitchen, worthy of a Nancy Meyers movie, charming gray library with a library ladder (her favorite room in the house), the generous landing at the foot of a sweeping staircase, anchored by a round table with a bouquet of white flowers. She finally settles on the living room, which a set-decorator friend furnished on the fly, with two creamy-white sofas and some big throw pillows. She looks at them curiously. “I didn’t even know I needed ‘throw pillows.’ ” Decorating, house stuff, “that was always Brad’s thing.” On cue, as if taunting her, Jolie’s large Rottweiler, Dusty, soaking from a trip to the pool, jumps onto the sofa, soiling it. She sighs, amused, half tries to wipe it off with her bare hand, then gives up and sits somewhere else. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Life in her household is apparently like this—messy, relaxed, normal. The kids are polite but not phony polite. Zahara, 12, whom Jolie describes as “the rock” of the family, comes downstairs. “Zaz!” Jolie cries, midsentence. They discuss the whereabouts of everyone else. Zahara hugs the wet dog. Jolie laughs and tells her daughter about the swim Dusty just took. We move to the kitchen, where Jolie fixes herself a cup of tea. Vivienne, 9, comes in with a friend, having just been at a sleepover. She’s wearing a jean backpack covered with pins. Jolie envelops her in her arms. I ask the girl if she’s called “Viv” or “Vivienne.” “Either one!” she says with a smile. She dumps her stuff on the counter and goes out to play with her friend. Jolie picks up a small piece of a blanket, shredded to death, and explains, laughing, “She has 32 blankets. She is very into her blanket, and she gets very mad if you wash her blanket. She actually said to me the other day, ‘Mom, I can taste my blanket.’ ‘That, honey, is a sign that it really, really needs to be washed.’ ” Jolie tidies up Vivienne’s things and promptly spills her entire mug of tea all over the counter. We step outside and there’s Shiloh, 11, and Knox, 9, hanging out. Shiloh, who likes to dress like a boy, is wearing a camouflage jacket, long shorts, and heavy black sneakers, despite the blazing heat. Knox immediately wants to know when Jolie’s going to put up the waterslide. “How about a ‘Hello, Mom’?” she says, with a hug, sounding like just about every other loving, exasperated mother in America. So far, there’s only one piece of personal artwork up—a black-and-white photograph on the mantelpiece of the six children, smiling and holding their various pets—dogs, reptiles, and rodents.

Jolie and Pitt, who’d been together for 12 years and appeared to be the most gloriously evolved couple in Hollywood, split last September. She filed for divorce suddenly “for the health of the family,” according to her lawyer, and announced she was seeking sole custody of the children, three of whom are adopted (Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, and Zahara), three of whom are biological (Shiloh, Vivienne, and Knox). Things had been rocky for some time, but the last straw was a dramatic trip on a private plane, where there was reportedly a physical and verbal altercation between Pitt and Maddox. When they touched down, Jolie went home with the kids, effectively kicking him out. This was no “Conscious Uncoupling.” An anonymous phone call was made to authorities. The F.B.I. and the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services began investigating Pitt for child abuse. He was soon cleared and later said in an interview with GQ Style that he was smarting from the pain of his suddenly broken family and admitted he had a serious drinking problem. There were rumors he was having an affair with Marion Cotillard (denied by both Pitt and Cotillard). Jolie got the early jump P.R.-wise. But Pitt won hearts and minds with the mea culpa in GQ Style. The two are still negotiating the terms of their divorce. As for Jolie, a life already bursting at the seams—with acting, directing, humanitarian work, parenting six kids, and guest-lecturing on women’s rights at the London School of Economics—just got exponentially bigger and more complicated, because she’s now doing it alone. There’s the chaos surrounding the practical day-to-day—playdates, doctors’ appointments, packing and unpacking, and organizing mealtimes. And there’s the deeper, emotional chaos. “It’s just been the hardest time, and we’re just kind of coming up for air. [This house] is a big jump forward for us, and we’re all trying to do our best to heal our family.” As it happens, the personal trauma has coincided with her most personal film yet. Jolie has directed a moving, large-scale adaptation of First They Killed My Father, Loung Ung’s 2000 memoir of the Khmer Rouge genocide, in which Ung’s parents and two of her siblings perished, along with an estimated two million other Cambodians, a quarter of the country’s population. Shot entirely in Cambodia, and in the Khmer language, the film, a Netflix original, is the largest production the country has witnessed since the war, and according to the reports of several Cambodians who’ve seen it, it’s one of the most revelatory pieces of art about that chapter in the country’s history, a history that’s still difficult for Cambodians to discuss. But if Cambodians consider the film to be something of a gift, then it’s surely a thank-you gift. For Jolie, Cambodia is where she started her family, and it’s where she made a cathartic personal transformation, becoming the woman she is today.

Recall, if you can, the Angelina of the late 90s, the era of Angie Peak Crazy. Specializing in dark volatile characters that seemed extensions of her wild-child restless self, Jolie won three Golden Globes for her roles in television movies and a best- supporting-actress Oscar for her portrayal of a young woman with apparent borderline personality disorder in Girl, Interrupted. She talked freely about having dabbled in heroin and self-cutting, and her love of knives. She and new husband Billy Bob Thornton wore each other’s dried blood in pendants around their necks, and publicly bragged about their wild sex. At the 2000 Oscar ceremony, she talked provocatively about being “so in love . . . right now” with her brother, James, and kissed him with unsettling intimacy. To be sure, Jolie had legitimate pain in her early life—her father, actor Jon Voight, had been unfaithful to her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, and the two split up early on. But it was First World pain. Being Hollywood’s newest “It girl” landed Jolie the title role in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, based on a popular video game. As it happened, the movie, an example of Hollywood’s most vacuous, commercial, shoot-’em-up instincts, was filmed on location in Cambodia. There, Jolie, who’d grown up in privileged bubbles in Los Angeles and New York, witnessed what real suffering looked like: poverty, the loss of limbs from land mines, a generation of relatives wiped out. In this world there was no room for free-floating malaise or self-indulgent antics. And in spite of their profound trials, “I found a people who were so kind and warm and open, and, yes, very complex,” recalls Jolie. “You drive around here you can see a lot of people with many things, but not often expressing happiness. You go there, and you see the families come out with their blanket and their picnic to watch a sunset.” Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. She suddenly became curious about the world—starting with the country she was in. One day in Siem Reap, Cambodia, she picked up a book that was being sold on the side of the road for $2: Ung’s memoir. It was among the factors that inspired Jolie to find a greater purpose. In 2001, equipping herself with as much knowledge as she could, she contacted the United Nations and eventually became a goodwill ambassador for the High Commissioner for Refugees. On one of her first U.N. missions, in 2002, she returned to Cambodia to meet up with NGO workers who were dealing with land-mine issues. Among them was Ung, the author of that transformative book, who had moved to America since the war but had spent her adult years working on Cambodia’s troubles. She had never seen an Angelina Jolie movie, but Jolie certainly didn’t seem like anyone’s vision of a movie star. “She was just a really cool human being,” recalls Ung. “And she didn’t mind getting dirty.” On her relationship with Brad Pitt: “We care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.” She and Jolie clicked and made a plan to travel together to a land-mine-filled part of Cambodia where Ung hadn’t been since the war. Thus began a sequence that sounds as though it must have been written for a movie—but it wasn’t. They met up with a bunch of de-miners, took off on mo-peds, with only a flashlight and some extra toilet paper as supplies, when a monsoon started. Soaked, they went to bed in hammocks. Before going to sleep, Jolie realized she already trusted Ung enough to ask her about something personal, something big she’d been thinking about—adopting a Cambodian orphan. “I asked her as a Cambodian orphan if she would be offended for somebody like me, an outsider, [to do that], or if that would be a nice thing,” recalls Jolie. Ung was wholeheartedly supportive. “Angie was maternal to everybody around her, not just children, but adults included. I wanted her to adopt me,” says Ung. “I was orphaned when I was eight years old, and so I think, when you’ve gone through experiences like that, there’s always a part of you that craves to have full parent figures in your life.” Jolie says that Ung’s enthusiasm for the idea of her adopting was a deciding factor. Had she responded differently, explains Jolie, “it might have changed my decision. It might have made it very hard for me.” Ung has been in Jolie’s life ever since and is now one of her few close friends. Jolie immediately set the adoption process in motion. A couple of months later, she visited an orphanage in the provincial town of Battambang, having promised herself that she’d go only to one, that she wasn’t going to shop around. But Jolie felt uneasy as she wandered the rooms, meeting the children. “I didn’t feel a connection with any of them,” she recalls. Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. “They then said, ‘There’s one more baby.’ ” Baby Maddox was lying in a box that was suspended from the ceiling. She looked at him. He looked at her. “I cried and cried,” she recalls.

And thus began a 15-year project, in which Jolie rebranded herself, expanding her world, her family, her career, and her image. She bought a house in Cambodia and became a citizen. In 2003, she started what became the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation, focusing on Cambodia’s environmental conservation, health, education, and infrastructure. She intensified her U.N. work, going on dozens of fact-finding missions, to such global hot spots as Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, and Haiti. (She’s now been on more than 60 missions.) She split from Thornton, who didn’t understand her newfound passion. She adopted her second child, Zahara, from Ethiopia. In 2004 she met Pitt, on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, when he was still married to Jennifer Aniston. For Jolie, dating Pitt—Hollywood’s gorgeous, laid-back golden boy—catapulted her to another level of fame. Though she has maintained that they didn’t become romantically involved until he and Aniston had split, the couple wasted no time in exhibiting their romance for the pages of W, which did a 32-page spread of them playing house, with a pretend brood of five. Aniston was devastated. For Pitt, dating Jolie meant doing it her way, at least at the outset. It marked the beginning of his own philanthropic life—in Africa, Haiti, and New Orleans—and he formally adopted Maddox and Zahara. He persuaded Jolie to have biological children. She gave birth to Shiloh in 2006, in Namibia, then the twins, Vivienne and Knox, in 2008. In between they adopted Pax, then three, from Vietnam. They bought more homes—in France, Spain, New York, and New Orleans. While Pitt, as a producer and actor, churned out one prestige movie after another (Moonlight, The Tree of Life, Moneyball, 12 Years a Slave), Jolie took a new chance with directing—with In the Land of Blood and Honey, about Bosnia, a project inspired by some of the U.N. work she’d done there. Together, they appeared unstoppable, the most creatively alive citizens on the planet. Nothing seemed beyond their abilities. They traipsed around the globe as a nomadic clan of eight, making art, doing good, and setting up home wherever they happened to be. They tied the knot in 2014, mainly because the kids wanted them to. They had the means to take along tutors for the children wherever they went. But Jolie’s idea of an education meant immersion in the real world, to bring an understanding of one’s “small part in the bigger picture.” For a time, it all worked beautifully. Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.

It was 2012, and Jolie had recently finished In the Land of Blood and Honey. She wanted her next project to be just as meaningful, and Ung’s story had at this point been with her for a decade. By the time they had a completed draft, the chance for Jolie to direct Unbroken, based on the best-selling book by Laura Hillenbrand, had come along, and they put the script aside. After that, Maddox, who knew “Auntie” Loung’s story, brought it up. “He was the one who said, ‘It’s time to do it,’ ” says Jolie. She knew that Maddox would be deeply involved in the production, that he’d be “standing there watching horrors that his countrymen did to each other. [So] he had to be ready.” Jolie and Ung dived back in. Credited on the film as an executive producer, Maddox read draft after draft, giving comments. Jolie took it to Netflix, where chief creative officer Ted Sarandos signed on without hesitation. “In the room, she created a visual experience of what this film could be,” recalls Sarandos. “The film is in many ways about the death of beauty, about the way the Khmer Rouge had killed all things beautiful, color itself, which becomes part of the joy of life. . . . That’s what hooked me more than anything.” Despite Jolie’s Cambodian ties, she felt she needed a Cambodian filmmaker to help shepherd the project. So she reached out to Rithy Panh, one of the most famous filmmakers in Cambodia, who had lost family members to the genocide and had chronicled the Khmer Rouge in several documentaries, including The Missing Picture, which was nominated for the best-foreign-language-film Academy Award in 2014. She and Panh agreed that the only way this film could be made was if Cambodia wanted it to be—not a foregone conclusion, given that Cambodians are still somewhat reticent about their painful history. (The Killing Fields, Roland Joffé’s 1984 film about the Khmer Rouge, had to be filmed in Thailand and elsewhere.) The war tribunals, which were set in motion in 2009 and are ongoing, have helped open up the topic. Still, Jolie was trepidatious and approached the country’s culture ministers gingerly, explaining that they were telling not just Ung’s story but also the story of a people. Jolie’s Cambodian track record made the difference, says Ung. “In a country like Cambodia, respect is very much elevated—respect for each other, respect for the culture, respect for the history, respect for the elders. Angie walks in Cambodia with this respect.” Cambodia went all in—closing off Battambang for days, giving the filmmakers permits to land in remote zones, providing them with 500 officials from their actual army to play the Khmer Rouge army. “It’s not a poetic thing to say—[this film] was made by the country,” says Jolie. Between cast and crew, some 3,500 Cambodians participated.

To cast the children in the film, Jolie looked at orphanages, circuses, and slum schools, specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship. In order to find their lead, to play young Loung Ung, the casting directors set up a game, rather disturbing in its realism: they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for, and then to snatch it away. The director would pretend to catch the child, and the child would have to come up with a lie. “Srey Moch [the girl ultimately chosen for the part] was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time,” Jolie says. “When she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion. All these different things came flooding back.” Jolie then tears up. “When she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didn’t have enough money for a nice funeral.” That authentic connection to pain was awakened in everyone involved, says Jolie, making for a film set like nothing she’d ever seen. “There wasn’t a person who was working on the movie who didn’t have a personal connection. They weren’t coming to do a job. They were walking in the exodus for the people whom they had lost in their family, and it was out of respect for them that they were going to re-create it . . . It completed something for them.” Some had flashbacks and nightmares. For this reason, a therapist was on set every day. And then there were the odd bystanders who hadn’t been aware that a movie was being made, and were traumatized. In one scene, recalls Jolie, “when the Khmer Rouge came over the bridge, we had a few people who really dropped to their knees and wailed. They were horrified to see them come back.” Given the size and complexity of the production, a different Hollywood director might have, consciously or not, muscled in and flexed her power in a way that might have seemed boorish. According to Ung and Panh, Jolie knows Cambodia so well she’s internalized the country’s character traits. At lunch, she waited in line like everyone else, recalls Panh, and she never raised her voice. “Here we don’t shout. We talk,” he says. In Cambodia, yelling is not just disrespectful—it’s also considered a sign of weakness. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Many eyes were on Maddox, who is as famous in Cambodia as Jolie. “It was a way for him to walk in the steps that most likely his birth parents walked,” says Jolie, who wasn’t sure how he’d ultimately react to the experience. Would he connect? Would he want to flee? Jolie was thrilled one morning during the shoot when she heard Maddox say, “Can I go sleep in my house with my friends?,” referring to their house in the jungle, which she had bought back in 2002. “I hadn’t heard him refer to it that way. You can’t push it. You can’t say, ‘Isn’t this great?’ You just have to kind of keep bringing them there, putting it in front of them . . . and hope that they find the pride and find the comfort.” She considers the endeavor to connect Maddox to his homeland—as she does Zahara to Ethiopia and Pax to Vietnam—a family effort, not a solo one. With that in mind, while Pitt was in the Middle East working on War Machine, the other five kids also went to Cambodia and played a role, official or not, in their mother’s movie. Pax did still photography. The other four were on set every day and became close playmates with the child actors. In February, the film premiered for an audience of 1,000 at the outdoor amphitheater near the temple complex of Angkor Wat. According to numerous reports, it was a screening filled with tears of recognition, remembrance, and catharsis. What moved Jolie perhaps more than anything was that “the Cambodian people had a big movie premiere. They saw a movie for which they made the sets. [It was] their actors doing a great job, their country looking beautiful even through all the horrors.”

Alas, while she was making film history for a country, her relationship with Pitt was suffering. By the time First They Killed My Father was in postproduction, in the summer of 2016, “things got bad,” says Jolie. “I didn’t want to use that word. . . . Things became ‘difficult.’ ” There has been Hollywood talk that their lifestyle had taken its toll on Pitt, and that he was craving a more stable, normal life for the whole family. When I bring this question up to her, it’s the one moment when Jolie becomes a bit defensive. “[Our lifestyle] was not in any way a negative,” she says quickly, adamantly. “That was not the problem. That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children . . . They’re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I’m very proud of them.” Jolie has indicated that, for the sake of the kids, she doesn’t want to talk about the breakup. And yet it seems she wants to get her point across, which calls for a careful choice of words, something of a high-wire act. “They’ve been very brave. They were very brave.” “In times they needed to be.” Other statements are similarly cryptic. “We’re all just healing from the events that led to the filing . . . They’re not healing from divorce. They’re healing from some . . . from life, from things in life.” I mention Pitt’s mea culpa in GQ Style. Did it surprise her? “No,” she replies, looking unmoved. I refer to tabloid reports that suggest their communication has improved, and ask if that’s true. There’s a long pause. She looks down, formulates an answer. “We care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.” There’s anger and pain right there beneath the surface. But she’s trying to keep the emotions at bay. “I was very worried about my mother, growing up—a lot. I do not want my children to be worried about me. I think it’s very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them. They need to know that everything’s going to be all right even when you’re not sure it is.” Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Her protectiveness over the kids has become all that more fierce due to her recent brushes with the specter of ovarian cancer; the disease took her mother’s life when she was just 56, as well as those of other family members. In a 2013 New York Times op-ed column, Jolie chronicled her decision to have a preventive double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery after she learned she had the BRCA1 gene. Two years later, while working in the editing room on By the Sea, she got a call from the doctor saying that he was concerned about certain levels in her blood work that potentially suggested cancer. “Ten minutes later, the room’s spinning, and you just think, How . . . ?” She kept the news from the kids, did further tests, and waited a few agonizing days. When she finally learned she didn’t have cancer, “I dropped to my knees.” She made an appointment to get her ovaries taken out. “I went into the actual surgery happy as they come. I was skipping. Because at that point it was just preventative.” She instantly went into menopause. Last year, in addition to hypertension, Jolie developed Bell’s palsy, a result of damage to facial nerves, causing one side of her face to droop. “Sometimes women in families put themselves last,” she says, “until it manifests itself in their own health.” Jolie credits acupuncture for her full recovery from the condition. Lately, her skin has become drier, she reports, and she has extra gray hairs. She quips, “I can’t tell if it’s menopause or if it’s just been the year I’ve had.” The idea that she could still be anyone’s idea of a sex symbol is laughable to her. But she says, “I actually feel more of a woman because I feel like I’m being smart about my choices, and I’m putting my family first, and I’m in charge of my life and my health. I think that’s what makes a woman complete.” Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.

Tomorrow, Jolie and the kids are headed to Africa. They’re visiting Namibia, where Shiloh was born, and Kenya, where Jolie will be checking in with a project connected to the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative, an organization she co-founded with British former foreign secretary William Hague. Specifically, members of the British military and peacekeepers will be receiving training in how to protect women from sexual violence in crisis zones. It’s not the obvious dream itinerary for a kid, and Jolie admits that she’s started to get a little pushback with the older ones. “I’m conscious that the boys are teenage boys, and maybe they’d rather be watching TV with their friends, and they’ve been to Africa, and they may not be as excited as the little ones. But they don’t really challenge me. They just kind of sit on the edge of my bed and say, ‘What are we going to do there?’ ” She assured them that she’d planned fun activities for them, like sandboarding. In any case, “they know that it’s important, and they know that Mom thinks that it’s going to be important when they’re older.” She knows it sounds a little strange, but Jolie can’t help who she is. “I never woke up and thought, I really want to live a bold life. I just can’t do the other. It’s the same as I can’t make a casserole. I cannot sit still.” For all her earlier talk about being interested in keeping house, now, as the conversation turns to Africa, she’s champing at the bit, desperate to flee. “I’ve been trying for nine months to be really good at just being a homemaker and picking up dog poop and cleaning dishes and reading bedtime stories. And I’m getting better at all three. But now I need to get my boots on and go hang, take a trip.” She believes that her personal will is infectious. The other day she made some joke to Knox along the lines of “Pretend to be normal.” “He said, ‘Who wants to be normal? We’re not normal. Let’s never be normal.’ Thank you—yes! We’re not normal. Let’s embrace being not normal!” Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.

OJ Simpson is starting to think about his future and making money, which is why he has begun to assemble a new team who are suggesting that the disgraced former football giant joins the cast of Dancing With The Stars.

“The plan is to find a place to reintroduce OJ to a new audience and hopefully remind his old fans why they once loved him. They do not want a big sit-down interview but rather somewhere where he doesn’t need to do a lot of talking, or explaining. A place where he can be funny and charming. That place is ‘Dancing With The Stars’,” sources tell Straight Shuter.

Malia Obama, 18, is adjusting to her new life outside of the White House and the changes are not easy to handle for her famous parents – former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.

The young woman is busy mixing up a prestigious internship at the Weinstein & Co. offices in Manhattan and cool nights with friends on the town.

The former first daughter is expected to attend Harvard University in the fall. All seems to be going well, but a negative story about Malia trying to beat up a right-wing journalist, allegedly, of course, has her parents worried.

She was also spotted having a fun time with a young man who was later identified as Rob Franklin.

Those headlines raised a lot of questions in some circles, and the power couple is reportedly not immune to the intense chatter.

Is she mature enough to handle life in this big place? Should they be more present in the life of the teenager at this crucial juncture?

Sources close to the Obamas have started talking to the media and describing the dilemma they are facing when it comes to their oldest child.

An insider spoke to a celebrity news website and stated: “Malia [Obama]‘s parents totally trust her and know she has a good head on her shoulders, but it’s still hard for them to let go.”

The person added: “They understand that she’s spreading her wings, that she’s bound to make some mistakes and they’re okay with that. But as much as they trust her they can’t help but worry about her. She’s living in the big city all alone and in their eyes she’s still a kid.”

Although it is always hard to tell if those so-called insiders really know what they are talking about, however, the statement above appears plausible.

Justin Vaisse's opinion
This relative absence of French-American political and social unity helps to explain anti-French sentiment in the United States. French historian Justin Vaïsse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward France in the United States is the small number of Americans of direct French descent1. http://www.politiqueinternationale.com/revue/article.php?id_revue=12&id;=228&content;=synopsis. While he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti-French sentiments, he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly, without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness. Vaïsse contends that by comparison, the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval. He proposes that as France has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it, it is socially and politically acceptable in the United States to express negative sentiments of the FrenchPierre Verdaguer, """"A Turn-of-the-Century Honeymoon? The Washington Post's Coverage of France"""", French Politics, Culture & Society, vol. 21, no. 2, summer 2003.
 Just to answer, I've read before that the proportion of french descendant in the US is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the New World at the same time as the Brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly, they were mixed into the mainstream america.

Jennifer Lopez gets cozy with on-screen boyfriend Milo Ventimiglia
2017-11-07T01:52:40+0000
She's had many a handsome leading man in her romantic comedies.

And Jennifer Lopez added another dashing co-star to her repertoire as she was spotted filming with Milo Ventimiglia on Monday.

The superstar, 48, looked casual chic in an off-the-shoulder sweater as the two actors shot a romantic date scene for Second Act.

Daring to impress, Jennifer was seen walking to set in a fur-lined black parka over a grey sweater and camouflage pants.

Her trademark chestnut tresses were left long and loose as they cascaded over her petite shoulders.

The Shades Of Blue actress turned on the charm as she looked deeply into Milo's eyes over glasses of red wine in the Italian restaurant.

Sporting his usual mustache, the This Is Us hunk, 40, rocked a grey button down as he seemed in serious conversation with his dinner date.

Second Act has Jennifer returning to her romantic comedy roots that made her a household name.

Peter Segal will direct the film - which was developed by STXfilms with Jennifer from an idea conceived by Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Justin Zackham.

The movie is in the vein of Maid In Manhattan - a huge hit for Jennifer - and Working Girl - the Oscar winning comedy from 1988.

Jennifer will play a big-box store employee who reinvents her life and gets the chance to prove that street smarts are as valuable as a college degree.

Leah Remini is attached to portray the best friend and fellow employee of Jennifer's character while Vanessa Hudgens will play a boss at a consumer goods company.

Dan Bucatinsky, Annaleigh Ashford, and Freddie Stroma round out the cast.

Second Chance is scheduled to debut at the end of 2018.

Ariana Grande, whose concert at the Manchester Arena was targeted in an attack on Monday night, has joined other celebrities in expressing horror at the events.

The American pop star, who was not hurt in the blast, tweeted that she was “broken” by news of casualties.

At least 22 people were killed and more than 50 injured after an explosion in or around the foyer area that left thousands of people fleeing. Grande’s European tour, which was due to visit London before dates in Belgium, Poland and Germany, has been suspended. 



Take That, who formed in Manchester in 1990, were playing a show at the Liverpool Echo Arena when the attack happened. In a statement, they said they would cancel the following night’s Liverpool show.

They have also postponed the dates they were due to play at Manchester Arena on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

Blondie canceled a Tuesday night concert in London “as a mark of respect for the victims of the terrible attack”. Lead singer Debbie Harry tweeted that the date at the Round Chapel in Clapton, east London, will be rescheduled.

The rapper Nicki Minaj, a friend of Grande whose vocals are included on her reggae-pop song Side to Side, was among the other celebrities and pop stars who reacted to Monday night’s attack:

Singers Jennifer Lopez and Pink also sent messages of support. On Tuesday afternoon, Rihanna added:

Johnny Marr, former Smiths guitarist and stalwart of Manchester’s music scene, tweeted “Manchester stands together”.

Guy Garvey, the broadcaster and singer with Elbow tweeted: “My hearts broken.”

The legendary Manchester band New Order tweeted in the early hours of Tuesday morning:

Grande’s current Dangerous Woman tour started in Phoenix, Arizona on 3 February followed by stops in Dublin, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands. 



After the Manchester date, she had been due to play in London, Poland, Germany, Switzerland, France, Spain, Italy, Mexico, Brazil, Japan, Thailand and Australia before coming to a the tour came to a close in Hong Kong in September. 



There has been no official message from Grande’s management about whether or not her tour will continue.

2440,"MTO EXPLOSIVE TEA: Word Coming Out Of BARBADOS . . . . Is That Rihanna Is PREGNANT . . . Just ONE MONTH After She's Seen FLIRTING With The Prince Of England!!!

December 29, 2016: We just got some EXPLOSIVE TEA from out of Barbados – where Rihanna has been staying for the past week. People close to her are speculating that she may be PREGNANT.
Why are they saying this? Well here's the tea:

The word here is that Robyn [Rihanna] is pregnant. She's been [in Barbados] for the past week and no smoking, or drinking, not even weed.
Rihanna is known for partying hard and has a particular FONDNESS for Broccoli – and we're NOT talking about the vegetable either. It's surprising that she's given it ALL UP at once.

Our snitch continued, even speculating that if Rihanna is pregnant, the most likely father is PRINCE HARRY – who was seen flirting with the Bajan Queen a month ago. MediaTakeOut.com's insider explained, ""When the Prince [Harry] was here, he flirted with Robyn [Rihanna] and they ran off together without security. My guess is that he is the father [if Rihanna is in fact pregnant].""

And our snitch is not the only ones. A quick search of social media pages from Bajans reveals that the ""Rihanna pregnant"" rumor is blowing up in the small Caribbean island.

This was her last night, showing no baby bump – but a definite GLOW!!",2

As far as I know it has been stated that several """"universes"""" do not fit into the actual accepted universe of Wold Newton which integrates with the DC comics universe thanks to Alan Moore. Thus Marvel only corresponds to the universe due to the cross-over connections or with the exception of Steven Rogers and Peter Parker whose worlds do not clash with the DC Universe chronology. As for Star Wars it is speculated that it could be linked to the Wold Newton Universe, only Star Wars takes place in an entirely different future-past element, basically a universe that predates that of the Earth. And Tolkien's universe is also out of context due to the complex mythology that has no links outside of its realm, the same applies to Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft and Warhammer. However the world of faeries is related thanks to King Arthur and Shakespeare as well as C.S. Lewis and Hans Christian Anderson/Brothers Grimm. Harry Potter's world also doesn't tie in to the Wold Newton as far as I have seen. And as for Looney Tunes and Disney the only way they might tie-in is through WHo Framed Roger Rabbit which has as of yet to be linked. Of course this is still a lot of debate as to what fits in and what doesn't, the only reason I added the list was to inform the reader as to why the characters from those """"universes"""" or """"worlds"""" were not present. Perhaps it could be stated that although they are not """"accepted"""" within the universe it is yet to be seen whether or not they are truly acknowledged as being apart from it as a whole.

This dancing duo is trying to find their rhythm.

Vanessa Lachey is responding to rumors she and ""Dancing with the Stars"" partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy are at odds, admitting to Us Weekly that she lets him call the shots in the ballroom.

""I just know that when I'm on set he's my coach and I'm the student, so I listen a lot more and I don't speak up as much because this is a field I don't know,"" she said.

Lachey, 36, seemingly tried to put feud rumors to bed, telling Us Weekly that Chmerkovskiy has taught her a lot in a short period of time.

""He's trained me and taught me so many amazing wonderful new things just like any trainer would or teacher would,"" the mother of three said.

On Tuesday, People reported that the 37-year-old professional dancer and his ""Dancing with the Stars"" Season 25 partner were having ""a big chemistry issue.""

""They both have big personalities and that's not always the best recipe for a good partnership,"" a source said.

A report from E! Online stated that Chmerkovskiy and Lachey ""can't find middle ground.""

Alan Bersten stepped in for Chmerkovskiy during Monday's episode of ""Dancing with the Stars."" Host Erin Andrews claimed that Lachey's partner was out ""dealing with personal issues,"" but provided no further insight into what was going on.

The network confirmed to E! that he'll return to the ballroom next week.

Rumors of an on-going behind the scenes battle between Chmerkovskiy and Lachey surfaced amid the lowest ""Dancing with the Stars"" ratings in at least two seasons.

Deadline reported that the show's premiere was down 19% from Season 24 and Season 23 among adult viewers aged 18 to 49. Just 10.4 million people tuned in to the first night of competition, which left some fans questioning whether the rumored dancing drama was an attempt to draw in more viewers.

2527,"Jennifer Aniston Doubts Justin Bieber Is The Right Man For Selena Gomez

A changed man that is what Justin Bieber is claiming to be, but it appears that Jennifer Aniston is not sure he is telling the truth.

It is a well-known fact that Aniston and Selena Gomez are good friends. According to well-placed sources, Aniston sees the Texan singer and actress as a daughter.

The person close to Brad Pitt’s former wife claimed that she is disappointed in Gomez’s decision to go back to the Canadian star who previously broke her heart.

The source, which spoke to OK!, claimed that Aniston does not want Gomez to get hurt again and she fears Bieber might cause trouble again.

If the story is accurate, Aniston will have to accept Gomez’s new romance because the pair plans to move in together.

A source spoke to People and claimed: “They are great and very happy.It just got too crazy last week with all the attention. Justin canceled his tour to take care of his mental health, and he wants to continue to focus on this. He did not like the chaos. They agreed to stay more low-key. It was Selena’s idea, and Justin is all for it. He is already looking at homes in the Calabasas, CA area. They just can’t wait to start their life together.”

The tipster added: “Their first home together is the beginning of what they hope will be a very long life together. They have both grown up so much. Being apart was crucial for them to move on and to realize they were meant to be together. Ultimately, buying a home to live in as a couple will seal the deal.”

A second insider told Hollywood Life that Bieber is more mature and he is taking it slow with Gomez to make sure this time around they finish as husband and wife.

The same source confessed that Gomez is proud of the improvements and changes Bieber has made to his life.

The pal shared: “Selena is blown away by Justin’s new integrity. Since they have reunited, Justin now keeps every promise he makes and is doing everything he says he is going to do. Selena feels secure in their relationship because he is making it easy for her to trust him completely.Justin has grown, matured and has really changed a lot in the last few years. She is falling in love all over again with a new and improved Justin who calls when he says he is going to call, texts when he says he will and is doing everything right.”

Fans are hoping it works out this time around.

Axed! Jennifer Hudson Won’t Be Asked Back To 'The Voice' Over Nightmare Diva Behavior

Jennifer Hudson’s first season as a coach on the NBC’s The Voice will likely be her last, as RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that her “diva antics” were just way too much handle for the cast and crew!

After winning the U.K. version of the hit reality singing competition show, Hudson, 36, joined Miley Cyrus, 24, Adam Levine, 38, and Blake Shelton, 41, for season 13 of the U.S. version.

According to a well-connected production source, Hudson and Shelton’s bickering was a huge problem for producers!

“Blake cannot stand Jennifer at all. The two are constantly at war both on-camera and off-camera and it has gotten to the point where he cannot even talk to her or look at her,” the source said.

But it isn’t only Shelton’s feathers that Hudson has ruffled! “She is also hated among the crew too,” the insider dished to Radar.

“Jennifer does not show up on time and is a complete diva when she does. She is constantly complaining about her outfits and is always unhappy with her hair and make-up,” spills the behind-the-scenes snitch.

“But honestly there is only so much that they can do!”

Lately, Hudson has been constantly plugging her own production company, JHud Productions, from her judging chair.

“She is using this platform for her own gain and she got reprimanded by execs for it,” the source said, adding, “And she still continues to do it anyways.”

As Radar previously reported, both Hudson and Cyrus are being ousted next season and are being replaced by returning coach Alicia Keys, 36, and Kelly Clarkson, 35.

Do you think that Jennifer Hudson should never return to ‘The Voice’ again? Sound off in the comments below.

""So I read Caitlyn's book,"" Kim reveals. ""She has her thoughts and you have your thoughts and that's fine, but I do feel like there's a way to tell your side of the story without being so negative. Everything is always your fault.""

""Absolutely,"" Kris agrees.

Kris Jenner Is ""So Angry"" About Her Portrayal in Caitlyn's Memoir

The mother and daughter then talk about Caitlyn's accusation that Kris had been ""hoarding"" money for years.

""She never paid a bill from 1972,"" the family matriarch tells Kim. ""She didn't know how much a gardener was, and in the book writes, 'Well, Kris didn't need me anymore. All the checks for Keeping Up With the Kardasahians, they all went to Kris.'""

She continues, ""How about it went to the mortgage and the insurance and education? You start talking about how I was hoarding money when we didn't even have it?!""

Kris also claims Caitlyn wasn't truthful about her divorce from ex-wife Linda Thompson while they were dating.

""She weaves this elaborate story about how she and Linda broke up,"" Kris recalls. ""Cait could've told me the story that she writes about in the book, which is…Linda got so angry and nasty that Cait had to tell her about her gender dysphoria. Why wouldn't you have just told me what happened with Linda so at least I could make my own decision if I wanted to get married to someone who really wanted to be a woman?""

Kim then chimes with her opinion. ""She just literally started three families with three different people and f--ked everyone over,"" she says.
""100 percent,"" Kris states. ""But [she] can't handle that negative publicity, so I'm going to be the scapegoat. She's going to throw me under the bus.""

Regarding the article List of ice hockey teams in Ontario. How should we handle the defunct teams from the OHL, OMJHL, and OHA Junior A?  
That is a really good question.  I would like to add them, as it would allow the list to be both complete, and consistant with the others.  I havent added defunct Jr A teams on any other article, but many of these OHA Jr A teams were the highest level of Junior hockey at the time, I believe, so should be added as being equivalent of Major-Junior.  However, that will likely make this a really long list.  It might make sense to split the article into two: active and defunct  as I did with the baseball lists.

'As this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) 

That has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk)

Laughter is the best medicine when it comes to coping with rumors in Hollywood, at least for Chelsea Handler and bestie Jennifer Aniston.

During a recent interview with U.K.’s You magazine, the talk show host-comedian opened up about those “crazy” rumors she hears about Aniston being hung up on ex-husband Brad Pitt’s September split from Angelina Jolie.

“I don’t think Jen cares about what’s going on, and it’s crazy that people think she does,” the former Chelsea Lately host said, defending close pal Aniston. “As if she’s sitting around caring about [Angelina Jolie]. I know I don’t.”

This isn’t the first time Handler has joked about the pair’s split. During a September episode of her Netflix series Chelsea, the comedian dissed the Academy Award-winning actress, saying she understood Pitt’s need to “self-medicate.”

Referring to her past remarks, Handler told You, “I just say what most people are thinking.”

Aniston, who was married to Pitt for five years, has been happily married to Justin Theroux since August 2015.

Donald Trump bragged in vulgar terms about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women during a 2005 conversation caught on a hot microphone, saying that ""when you're a star, they let you do it,"" according to a video obtained by The Washington Post.

The video captures Trump talking with Billy Bush, then of ""Access Hollywood,"" on a bus with the show's name written across the side. They were arriving on the set of ""Days of Our Lives"" to tape a segment about Trump's cameo on the soap opera.

Late Friday night, following sharp criticism by Republican leaders, Trump issued a short video statement saying, ""I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize."" But he also called the revelation ""a distraction from the issues we are facing today."" He said that his ""foolish"" words are much different than the words and actions of Bill Clinton, whom he accused of abusing women, and Hillary Clinton, whom he accused of having ""bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.""

""I've never said I'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I'm not. I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words don't reflect who I am,"" Trump said.

In an apparent response to Republican critics asking him to drop out of the race, he said: ""We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.""

The tape includes audio of Bush and Trump talking inside the bus, as well as audio and video once they emerge from it to begin shooting the segment.

In that audio, Trump discusses a failed attempt to seduce a woman, whose full name is not given in the video.

""I moved on her, and I failed. I'll admit it,"" Trump is heard saying. It was unclear when the events he was describing took place. The tape was recorded several months after he married his third wife, Melania.

""I did try and f--- her. She was married,"" Trump says.

Trump continues: ""And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, 'I'll show you where they have some nice furniture.'""

""I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. And she was married,"" Trump says. ""Then all of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits and everything. She's totally changed her look.""

At that point in the audio, Trump and Bush appear to notice Arianne Zucker, the actress who is waiting to escort them into the soap-opera set.

""Your girl's hot as s---, in the purple,"" says Bush, who's now a co-host of NBC's ""Today"" show.

""I've got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,"" Trump says. ""You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful - I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait.""

""And when you're a star, they let you do it,"" Trump says. ""You can do anything.""

""Whatever you want,"" says another voice, apparently Bush's.

""Grab them by the p---y,"" Trump says. ""You can do anything.""

[In wake of debate, multiple women accuse Trump of sexual advances]

A spokeswoman for NBC Universal, which produces and distributes ""Access Hollywood,"" declined to comment.

""This was locker-room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close,"" Trump said in a statement. ""I apologize if anyone was offended.""

Billy Bush, in a statement released by NBC Universal, said: ""Obviously I'm embarrassed and ashamed. It's no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago - I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I'm very sorry.""

After the video appeared online Friday afternoon, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter: ""This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president."" Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.), told reporters, ""It makes me sick to my stomach,"" while campaigning in Las Vegas.

Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which has endorsed Clinton, issued a statement from Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens saying: ""What Trump described in these tapes amounts to sexual assault.""

Trump was also criticized by members of his own party. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who said he is ""sickened"" by Trump's comments, said the Republican presidential candidate will no longer appear with him at a campaign event in Wisconsin on Saturday.

""Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests,"" Ryan said in a statement.

In a short statement issued moments after Ryan's, Trump said his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, ""will be representing me"" at the Wisconsin event.

Sen. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), who is running for reelection and has said she will vote for Trump, called his comments ""totally inappropriate and offensive.""

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has stood by Trump uncritically through numerous controversies, said in a statement: ""No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.""

Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a Trump critic, said in a statement: ""Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America's face to the world.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the comments are ""repugnant, and unacceptable in any circumstance"" and made clear Trump's brief statement would not suffice.

""As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape,"" he said late Friday.

One of Trump's most prominent social-conservative supporters, Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, told BuzzFeed's Rosie Gray: ""My personal support for Donald Trump has never been based upon shared values.""

Trump's running mate, Pence, was at a diner in Toledo when the news broke - about to view the diner's collection of signed cardboard hot-dog buns, which includes one signed by Trump. But the reporters traveling with Pence were quickly ushered out of the diner by campaign staff, before they could ask Trump's running mate about it, according to Politico. Politico reported that the journalists, traveling in Pence's ""protective pool,"" were not permitted to film Pence as he left the diner.

The tape appears at a time when Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has sought to make a campaign issue out of his opponent's marriage. Trump has criticized former president Bill Clinton for his past infidelity and criticized opponent Hillary Clinton as her husband's ""enabler.""

""Hillary Clinton was married to the single greatest abuser of women in the history of politics,"" Trump told the New York Times in a recent interview. ""Hillary was an enabler, and she attacked the women who Bill Clinton mistreated afterward. I think it's a serious problem for them, and it's something that I'm considering talking about more in the near future.""

Trump carried on a very public affair with Marla Maples - his eventual second wife - while still married to first wife Ivana Trump.

Trump has been criticized in this campaign for derogatory and lewd comments about women, including some made on TV and live radio. In an interview Wednesday with KSNV, a Las Vegas television station, Trump said that those comments were made for entertainment.

""A lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment. There's nobody that has more respect for women than I do,"" he told the station.

""Are you trying to tone it down now?"" asked the interviewer, Jim Snyder.

""It's not a question of trying, it's very easy,"" Trump said.

The tape obtained by The Post seems to have captured Trump in a private moment, with no audience beyond Bush and a few others on the bus. It appears to have been shot around Sept. 16, 2005, which was the day media reports said Trump would tape his soap-opera cameo.

The video shows the bus carrying Trump and Bush turning down a street on the studio back lot. The two men cannot be seen.

""Oof, get out of the way, honey,"" Bush says, apparently referencing somebody else blocking the view of Zucker.

The two men then exit the bus and greet Zucker.

""We're ready, let's go,"" Trump says, after the initial greetings. ""Make me a soap star.""

""How about a little hug for the Donald?"" Bush says. ""He just got off the bus.""

""Would you like a little hug, darling?"" Zucker says.

""Absolutely,"" Trump says. As they embrace, and air-kiss, Trump says, ""Melania said this was okay.""

The video then follows Trump, Bush and Zucker into the studio. Trump did appear on ""Days of Our Lives"" in late October. In a tape of that cameo posted online, Zucker's character asks Trump - playing himself - for a job at his business, and tells him suggestively, ""I think you'll find I'm a very willing employee. Working under you, I think, could be mutually beneficial.""

Trump's character gives her the brushoff.

""That's an interesting proposition,"" Trump says on-screen. ""I'll get back to you.""

A publicist for Zucker did not immediately respond to questions on Friday afternoon.

Barack Obama and his wife Michelle continues to falls apart in the wake of the president's womanizing. Now it's costing taxpayers millions! The bitter marriage betweenandcontinues to falls apart in the wake of the president's womanizing. Now it's costing taxpayers millions! The National ENQUIRER has seen exclusive records obtained by the government watchdogs of Judicial Watch - revealing that the feuding couple took separate private planes to take off to Hawaii for Christmas vacation!

According to official Air Force records, the battling Obamas used both Air Force One and a Boeing C-32A - the military equivalent of a Boeing 757. The second plane was apparently used to transport the First Lady so that she didn't have to travel with her Presidential spouse!

That helped to boost the costs of the strained couple's Christmas vacation to a total of $3,590,313.60! Michelle was traveling in style, too!

The Air Force's fact sheet revealed that the luxury plane features ""a fully-enclosed stateroom,"" plus ""a changing area, private lavatory, separate entertainment system, two first-class swivel seats and a convertible divan that seats three and folds out to a bed.""

The ENQUIRER has already revealed how the angry First Lady has earned the nickname ""Monster Michelle"" from staffers who watch in fear as she often goes on the warpath!

""Michelle has been labeled a 'ruthless mon­ster' for bullying not only Barack, but her loyal staff,"" said an insider. ""She dishes out abuse and punish­ment for the slightest of infractions. She doesn't give a damn who she humiliates - even the presi­dent!""

Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg (pictured) crashed her family's Martha's Vineyard vacation The ENQUIRER exposed how Michelle Obama exploded in fury when(pictured) crashed her family's Martha's Vineyard vacation and made off with her husband! Sources said that Caroline - President Barack Obama's U.S. ambassador to Japan - showed up out of the blue during the last week of the Obamas' two-week vacation on the Massachusetts island.

""He immediately started flirting up a storm, while Michelle could barely keep her temper in check,"" a snitch told The ENQUIRER. ""Even though both their families were there, it was really intense!""

The ENQUIRER has also caught the First Couple fighting over wild child Malia after the 17-year-old was recently caught at a boozy Brown University student bash. Eyewitnesses said the First Daughter was playing the popular campus drinking game called Beer Pong!

""The First Lady and the President got into a screaming match over it, each blaming the other for letting their underage daughter attend a wild drinking party,"" said a political insider.

Michelle also ignored the taxpayers when she stormed off for a trip to China with her mother and daughters - putting aside Obama's concerns over cost.

Insiders told The ENQUIRER that Michelle (seen here in France) couldn't stand to be around her husband after the president took an embarrassing ""selfie"" photo with sexy Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela's memorial service!

Things got worse for Barack after Michelle discovered a secret love nest kept by her husband! Multiple insiders confirmed to The ENQUIRER that Obama was a regular at the swanky Jefferson Hotel, located a few blocks from the White House.

""The 'commander-in-cheat,' as he's known at the place, comes and goes so frequently that some hotel staffers call the door he uses the 'Barack entrance,'"" the insider divulged. ""It's easy for the president to get to - and, best of all, it has a secret entrance so he can come and go discreetly!""

Even though it’s been a while since then and we all thought the reality TV star was a lot better, it seems like the horrifying Paris robbery is very much still on Kim Kardashian’s mind.

We have learned that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is still unable to wear her jewelry.

As fans may already be aware, ever since she was robbed at gunpoint in her Paris suite last year, Kim has been battling panic attacks and anxiety that rendered her homebound for months.

When she finally returned to her public life, the Kardashian seemed a whole different person – a lot more modest and reserved than usual.

Apparently, although she looked like she was getting better, sources say anxiety and panic attacks still take place and wearing jewelry is what triggers them!

‘She thought she would be over this by now, but if anything it’s getting worse. Kim is much stronger about most aspects of the trauma, but whenever she puts on a heavy necklace or even a favorite watch it gives her panic attacks and terrible flashbacks. She is looking fantastic and can cope with the occasional light piece of jewelry, but feels naked without being able to wear some of her favorite necklaces and earrings,’ the insider said about Kim’s more casual style these days.

Her trauma over the robbery that could have cost her her life has even led Kardashian to attend therapy in order to cope with the trauma.

But despite the fact that her therapist is of great help, they are still figuring out how to fix her accessories issue.

For now, the only solution is to wear as little jewelry as possible.

Meanwhile, we can reveal that Kim will also not return for Fashion Week in Paris this year.

Do you believe that Kim will ever get over her trauma and be her old self again?

2493,"Kim Kardashian Trying To Steal Kanye West's Money Through Elaborate Prenup Scheme?

Is Kim Kardashian trying to steal Kanye West's money along with his fame? According to a new report from Star, Kim is treating her prenup to Kanye like a business transaction, which is probably a smart decision. Let's be realistic – how long is this marriage going to last? Two years? Five years? She's already gone through this rodeo once, and she knows that eventually, she'll end up getting Kanye's money if she plays her cards right. The only question is – how much?

Kanye is reportedly worth $100 million whereas Kim is only worth $40 million, and so Kim is supposedly trying to, 'take as much of Kanye's fortune as possible'. A source explains, ""Kim and Kris [Jenner] apparently want a $10 million cheating clause in the prenup too, in the event that the marriage ends due to the rapper's wandering eye. Kris wants Kim to get $5 million a year for each year they're married, plus a $20 million bonus if they last five years.""

Kanye's so whipped that he might actually go for this, and you know that five years down the line, Kris is going to make sure Kim will cash in that $20 bonus. Like, her daughter's happiness? Please, she would rather have the $20 million.

And although we've discussed Kim's demands, Kanye's supposed demands are even more ridiculous. Star claims that Kanye will include something called a 'classy clause', which will, ""prevent Kim from doing anything to embarrass him during the marriage or the divorce proceedings."" Well, I wouldn't count on that lasting, especially since there's only so long Kim will contain her inner famewhore during their marriage.

Pushed Over Edge by Anniversary of Mom's Funeral

Kanye West just snapped a week ago Monday in what we're told was a ""nervous breakdown"" ... triggered in large part by the anniversary of his mother's death.

Sources very close to Kanye tell TMZ ... he was increasingly becoming a powder keg of emotions in the weeks leading up to his hospitalization at the UCLA Medical Center ... fueled by what we're told was a shocking lack of sleep and the pressures of touring, running his businesses, parenting and providing emotional support to his wife who was suffering her own emotional trauma after the Paris robbery.

But our sources say the trigger for the breakdown was Donda's death back in November 2007. Her funeral was November 20 -- the same day he cancelled his show at the L.A. Forum. The following day -- November 21 -- Kanye cancelled the remainder of the tour and hours later suffered the breakdown.

People close to Kanye tell us he never effectively grieved over his mom's death and has always had a difficult time in November, but this time he reached the breaking point.

Kanye, we're told, has had trouble handling stress over the last few months, and in the week or so before the breakdown he started to unravel.

As we reported ... Kanye became paranoid when he was taken to UCLA ... refusing for a time to even let doctors touch him. He also ranted that people were trying to ruin his marriage.

Kanye was sedated and is being treated by doctors and mental health professionals. Doctors hoped to release him 2 days ago, but that didn't happen and so far ... no new release date.

2803,"Watch Barack Obama's sweet surprise for Michelle on their 25th anniversary

Already known for his sweet messages to his wife on birthdays and holidays, Barack Obama went big for his 25th wedding anniversary with Michelle on Tuesday.

He surprised the former first lady with a heart-melting video message while she was in the middle of a talk with television producer Shonda Rhimes at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women in Philadelphia.

""I better get home!"" a smiling and blushing Michelle said to Rhimes and the audience after seeing the message.

Barack appeared on screen at the conference near the end of a 57-minute talk by Michelle. (Jump to the 54-minute mark in the video.) He apologized to the attendees for having to ""crash this party,"" before letting his wife know what she means to him.

""Now, the idea that you would even put up with me for a quarter of a century is a remarkable testament to what a saintly, wonderful, patient person you are,'' he said. ""It was a lot easier for me to do it because the fact of the matter is that not only have you been an extraordinary partner, not only have you been a great friend, somebody who could always make me laugh, somebody who would always make sure that I was following what I thought was right, but you have also been an example to our daughters and to the entire country.""

His sentiments came after Michelle had posted a photo from their 1992 wedding on Instagram with a message of love for the former president on their anniversary.

""Your strength, your grace, your determination, your honesty, the fact that you look so good doing all this, the way in which you've always taken responsibility for your own actions but also for looking out for the people around you is remarkable,'' he continued. ""And it's no wonder that as people got to know you the way that I got to know you, they fell in love.""

His message was the latest example of the type of genuine affection between the two that was often on display in many touching moments throughout the eight years they were in the White House.

Barack and Michelle have been together since 1989, when he met her while working as a summer associate at a Chicago law firm where she worked.

""It is truly the best decision that I ever made to be persistent enough, asking you out on a date, that you finally gave in,'' he said. ""And I hope you feel the same way. So, I don't want to interrupt the flow of what I'm sure is a fascinating discussion, but I figured that you wouldn't mind maybe me parachuting in just to say how much I love you and how much I appreciate you.""

2745,"rad Pitt attends charity concert with Sting in rare public appearance following split from Angelina Jolie

Brad Pitt reemerged in the spotlight Saturday after keeping a low profile for months following his split from Angelina Jolie.

The A-list actor seemed to be in strong spirits as he made the rounds at a charity concert in Malibu, where a bevy of stars turned out to raise awareness for a serious skin disease called epidermolysis bullosa.

Pitt, 53, attended the Rock4EB! Charity gig with his pals, musicians Sting and Chris Cornell, who headlined the event. The ""Allied"" actor was seen socializing throughout the evening, shaking hands and sharing laughs with others on hand, according to People.

He later took the stage during the concert, where he jokingly imitated Sting in front of the laughing crowd.

""When I started my career back in, uh..."" he joked. ""When I started making wine back in, uh ... very good wine, by the way.""

Pitt also introduced Cornell, the singer and songwriter behind grunge band Soundgarden, before he took the stage, calling him a ""someone I've known for quite a while and that I'm a huge fan of.""

Pitt was far from the only big name at Saturday's charity event, which was sponsored by jewelry company Alex and Ani and hosted by Zach Galifianakis. Courteney Cox, Kaley Cuoco and David Spade were among the other stars in attendance.

The actor's appearance at the benefit concert comes less than a week after he surprised viewers at the Golden Globes by presenting the film ""Moonlight,"" which was produced by his Plan B Entertainment company.

Pitt mostly disappeared from the public eye following his contentious split from Angelina Jolie in September after two years of marriage and 12 years together overall.

Jolie currently has physical custody of their six kids through a temporary agreement, but the two stars continue to attempt to work out a permanent plan.

The duo agreed last week to handle the remainder of their court battle in private, weeks after one of Jolie's previous filings became available for public viewing.

2677,"Jake Gyllenhaal Is Not Here for Taylor Swift Questions

Left, by Mike Pont/WireImage; Right, from GC Images, both from Getty Images.

In 2010, famously private Jake Gyllenhaal and Taylor Swift dated. Nearly a decade later, he's shutting down questions about it in interviews-this time in The Guardian.

At the time, Gyllenhaal was nine years her senior-a minor scandal-but the relationship only lasted three months. It would have turned into one of the smoldering ember piles of forgotten celebrity relationships that dot the tabloid landscape if not for that maple-latte photo and ""Red,"" the song Swift allegedly wrote about Gyllenhaal, which initiated him into a sort of club: a group of men that have inspired Swift songs.

Now, nearly seven years later, in the year of our Lord 2017, the actor has to contend with the unhappy reality of answering questions about his time with Swift. Call it club dues, made payable to interviewers.

Gyllenhaal has spoken about the relationship without giving too much away before (notably in 2015 on Howard Stern), but he's no longer abiding those questions. Writer Tim Jonze for the The Guardian found that out in an interview, which was ostensibly about the actor's new movie, Life. Here's the tensest part of the exchange, as it's rendered by Jonze:

For someone so intensely private, wasn't it playing with fire a little to start dating [Taylor Swift]? Asking this proves to be a mistake. ""I think when you're in a relationship, you are constantly scrutinised, your friends are scrutinised, but ..."" He trails off and stares at me, ramping up the intensity of his eyes like he's done in so many roles. But what? Gyllenhaal just continues to stare. Then he performs an exaggerated shrug. So, er, did he listen to any of the many songs rumored to be about him? More silence. The atmosphere has become uncomfortably tense. Would he like to move on? ""I would love to not talk about my personal life."" I don't think this is, massively. ""Oh, really? You don't?"" he asks.

Are you s-h-i-v-e-r-i-n-g yet? Put on another layer because later Gyllenhaal recounts his time meeting Obama and manages to bring it back to The Question. ""[Obama] told me: 'You have a job as an artist to help people through difficult times, to illuminate things through art.' He said: 'That's your job.' And my parents have always said that, too. And I'm sure you know it, because you seem like a very smart person who has done their research, particularly into tabloid research, which is obviously the most important of all research.""

And that's not it for the Siberian tundra of an actor. Still on politics, Gyllenhaal says, ""So, it's an irony to me when people say: 'An entertainer or actor should not be political,' because it's very easy to sideline people and, for instance, ask about past relationships or things that I believe are meant to be private.""

Gyllenhaal is the iceberg, and Jonze, the Titanic, completely sunk by Gyllenhaal's final act: ""muttering"" to a handler, ""It's always the last [interview of the day]."" We've all learned a valuable lesson, too. Gyllenhaal's Life is fair game, but his life is not.

Vanity Fair has reached out to Gyllenhaal for comment.

Tom Cruise has not met his daughter Suri Cruise in the last three and a half years but looks like things are going to change for The Mummy actor. If reports are to be believed then Tom might reunite with his daughter Suri.

According to reports, the actor wants his 11-year-old daughter back as he misses being with family. Not only that, the actor is all set to marry again. Tom believed that he would not be ready to meet Suri until she goes to college, but after a recent interaction with a reporter, he changed his decision

Also Read: The Mummy actor Tom Cruise opens up about daughter Suri's future as an actress

""Tom has steered clear of Suri because of Katie and didn't feel he'd be able to come back into Suri's life until she was in college and away from Katie,"" a source close to the Top Gun actor told In Touch magazine. ""But now that he's in hot pursuit of a new wife, he wants Suri back in his life. He misses having a family.""

Tom apparently got inspired to reconnect with his daughter after a reporter asked him Suri's about future. Recently, a reporter asked Tom whether Suri will follow his and Katie Holmes' footsteps and enter the entertainment industry. Though he replied, ""You never know,"" the question sparked something in the father.

""The reporter's question triggered something in Tom and made him want to reconnect with Suri even more,"" the source said, adding, ""It's happening.""

However, Gossip Cop has debunked the report and reported that the reunion between the father and the daughter is not happening and the magazine reports are false.

In March, there were a few reports suggesting that the actor misses being with a family after his mother's death and wants to reconnect with his youngest daughter. However, the father-daughter reunion has not happened until now.

So, what do you think will Tom Cruise meet his daughter Suri Cruise?

2548,"Ryan Gosling says he gave up smoking after filming The Nice Guys

It's a bad habit that many people struggle to kick.

But Ryan Gosling seems to have found the best way to quit smoking once and for all, and according to him, it actually works.

The 35-year-old actor told Australian radio hosts, Kyle And Jackie O, on Tuesday that he 'smoked himself out' whilst filming The Nice Guys, in which he plays a private investigator Holland March, who is addicted to cigarettes.

Admitting he was a smoker in real life before filming, the father-of-two revealed he has since quit after being turned off by smoking too much.

'I use to, but in this movie I smoked myself out,' he laughed, adding: 'I never want another cigarette again!'

'It really is the greatest way to quit - it's hard to come by - you really have to get a film where you have to smoke all the time, but I highly recommend it if you are trying to quit,' he went on.

As well as smoking a lot for the film, the Hollywood star also revealed he drank a lot too - largely due to the influence of his co-star Russell Crowe.

'In terms of the drinking, I am supposed to be drunk all the time in the film, but it actually worked out because I went out with Russell right before we started shooting, so I was still drunk the entire shoot,' he said.

He went on to add: 'So I never had to play drunk once, I was 'Scooby Doo-py' all day long thanks to him!' he joked.

During the chat, Ryan spoke of the close friendship he formed with the Australian star during filming, and says Russell introduced him to some iconic Aussie traits.

'God bless him he tried to teach me about Rugby,' the actor said.

'He was also pumping me with these Australian ginger beer and vodka while he was trying to teach me,' he added.

Kyle was quick to interject, saying: 'That's not very Australian! I don't think I know anyone who drinks that!'

However, Ryan wasn't having any of it, responding: 'Hey listen to me... If Rusty says it's Australian, it's Australian! You understand?'

The two stars are currently on the promotional trail for The Nice Guys.

Russell plays a contract killer to Ryan's private investigator in the film, with the pair working together to solve the mysterious disappearance of a porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.

The film is scheduled to hit cinemas in Australia next week.

The jabs taken back and forth after that deserve a synopsis only. Your idiotic little comment about album sales was excessive and unnecessary. It belongs in there no more than the fact that everyone who knows both artists agrees that if they ever got into it, Everlast would knock the living shit outta Eminem. And THAT came off an Eminem fan site.",0
2685,"Prince died of accidental overdose of opioid fentanyl, medical examiner says

Ramsey, Minnesota (CNN) Toxicology tests for Prince concluded that the entertainer died from an accidental overdose of the opioid fentanyl, according to a report on his death by the Midwest Medical Examiner's Office.

Prince, whose full name was Prince Rogers Nelson, died April 21 at age 57, after being found unresponsive in an elevator at Paisley Park, his home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota.

The report from the medical examiner's office, which was released on Twitter, didn't provide many details. ""How injury occurred: The decedent self-administered fentanyl,"" the report said. For manner of death, a box was marked for ""accident.""

The report didn't specify how the drug was taken and if the fentanyl was prescribed or illegally made.

The music superstar weighed 112 pounds and was 63 inches tall when he died, the report said. He was wearing a black cap, shirt, pants, boxer briefs and socks and a gray undershirt, the report said. His occupation was listed as ""artist"" and his business as ""music.""

The full autopsy and toxicology reports will not be released, the office told CNN.

Since his death, information has emerged about the entertainer's alleged abuse of prescription drugs.

A law enforcement source told CNN's Evan Perez in April that the entertainer was found with opioid medication at the time of his death. Investigators so far haven't found any indication that Prince had a valid prescription for the recovered opioid medications

An attorney for Prince's half-siblings said they revealed the singer had an addiction to Percocet decades before he died. One half-sibling said Prince started using the drug to help him deal with the rigors of performing, not for recreational use.

On April 15, on his way home after performing in Atlanta, Prince's plane made an emergency landing in Moline, Illinois. Prince was unresponsive and taken to a hospital. A law enforcement official told CNN he was treated for a potential overdose of pain medication.

The day before Prince died, his team called an eminent opioid addiction specialist in California seeking urgent help for the singer, an attorney working for the specialist and his son said.

The specialist, Dr. Howard Kornfeld, couldn't get there immediately so he sent his son, Andrew Kornfeld, on an overnight flight to Minnesota. The goal was for the younger Kornfeld to help evaluate Prince's health and encourage him to enter treatment for pain management and potential addiction issues, attorney William Mauzy told reporters.

But by the time Andrew Kornfeld arrived at the singer's Paisley Park complex on the morning of April 21, it was too late. He and two Prince representatives found the 57-year-old entertainer unresponsive in an elevator. Andrew Kornfeld was the person who called 911, Mauzy said.

Authorities have also said the investigation into Prince's death is a criminal investigation. It was not immediately clear if Kornfeld is the subject of a separate investigation.

Federal prosecutors and the Drug Enforcement Administration are investigating how Prince obtained prescription medications and from whom, the agencies said.

Angelina Jolie is going back to her roots — and demanding everyone around her speak French!

A snitch told The National ENQUIRER the 41-year-old mother of six, whose maternal grandfather was French-Canadian, has become obsessed with all things French — and has made sure the children she shares with her ex Brad Pitt are fluent in the language as well!

“Angie is extremely sentimental at the moment — meeting up with her estranged dad after years is proof of that,” disclosed a confidant. “But this French thing, it’s all about trying to feel close to her late mother.”

While those in Angie’s camp are sympathetic, they’re also annoyed with her new linguistic preference because most of them don’t speak the language — and don’t plan on learning it anytime soon!

“It’s driving everyone crazy, but she’s trying to find something to cling to right now — and her mother’s heritage is it,” spilled another tipster. “The problem is she comes across as someone completely out of touch — and selfish!”

2519,"Leah Remini Opens Up About Her Friendship With Jennifer Lopez And The Scientology Connection

Jennifer Lopez and ex-Scientologist Leah Remini are the best of friends. They have known each other for several years and have been through a lot. Come what may, their friendship weathers through. It has always seemed that Leah was the only one with a Church of Scientology connection, but that isn’t the case.

In a recent interview with People, Leah Remini shared how her friend Jennifer Lopez fits into the Scientology equation. While Jennifer isn’t a member of the Church of Scientology herself, her father David is. He has been in the church for over 30 years. When Leah left the Church of Scientology, she was lucky that her husband Angelo Pagan, her daughter Sofia, and her mother Vicky all came with her. A topic she has covered on her A&E Emmy-nominated show, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, is “disconnecting.”

When a member of the Church of Scientology decides to leave the religion, their friends and family that are still in the church are no longer to have contact with them. This is called disconnecting. Now, while the church’s rebuttal is that no one is forced to disconnect and that it is a choice, viewers of her show understand how serious disconnection is taken.

Leah shared that actually, her friend Jennifer Lopez could be in danger of disconnection for remaining her friend. The way the Church of Scientology believes, David Lopez, being an active member, should disconnect from Jennifer because of her continuing connection to Leah. She did imply that it is enforced more for members who are not such “big names.” Considering she left the Church of Scientology in 2013, it appears there have been no repercussions for their friendship.

The Church of Scientology took offense to her observations and responded by bashing Leah’s show where she takes on the church. The few times the church has responded to Leah Remini, it has always been to refute all claims their ex-believer has made. They say she is lying, staging the show, and all other ex-members who are on her show are just as dishonest. Leah remains dedicated to exposing the church and the leaders.

2456,"Billy Bush's wife is 'furious' at him after Trump interview leak

Billy Bush may have just posted a new selfie with his wife, but rumors are swirling that all is not well back in their California paradise.

The recently-fired Today Show host has moved back to Los Angeles after his now-infamous 2005 Access Hollywood interview with Donald Trump was leaked.

But sources told Page Six that Sydney Davis, Bush's wife of 18 years, is furious about the tape and less than happy to have him back at home with their three daughters.

'She was so furious that she refused to speak with him for a while,' an NBC insider told the site. 'They are having marriage problems.'

In the tape, Bush can be heard calling actress Arianne Zucker 'hot as s***,' and also saying nothing while Trump makes lewd comments about his co-host Nancy O'Dell.

But the moment that really angered Davis, a source claims, was when Bush, after gawking at Zucker's legs, asked her if she would give him and the Donald 'a little hug'.

'It wasn't just the vile talk,' the source said. 'It's because he insisted the woman hug him and Trump. It was creepy.'

Bush, 45, later released an apology for the interview and said he was 'embarrassed and ashamed', but did not make any mention of Davis.

'I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along,' he said in the statement. 'I'm very sorry.'

The source said Davis is enraged that Bush 'was stupid enough to put himself in that position' and has now lost what could have been a life-changing gig.

'Billy has brought him on himself,' they said. 'He's blown his big chance at Today and he doesn't have his old job at Access [Hollywood] to fall back on.'

'He fears his career is over. His wife is angered that he has embarrassed her and their daughters.'

Bush refused to comment on the article to Page Six, telling the site: 'I cannot take this call.'

Davis has also never released a statement about the incident, but on Saturday she did reappear on her husband's Instagram.

Bush returned to social media nearly two weeks after first confirming he was leaving The Today Show, posting a picture of him and Davis in the great outdoors.

'Hiking with lady long legs,' he wrote in the caption. 'Nice to get out.'

It was the first photo Bush, 45, had shared on Instagram in three weeks.

Davis features prominently in Bush's Instagram, most recently visiting him in New York with their daughters just before the hot mic scandal.

'Teaching the squad about the NYC Subway ONLY way to go,' Bush wrote in one caption, adding that his daughters hated when he said the word 'squad'.

In another photo him and Davis posted with their daughter on her 18th birthday as she received her first tattoo.

Bush, who worked at Access Hollywood for 15 years, had only held his new job at Today for two months when he was given the boot following the Trump scandal.

Matt Lauer confirmed Bush's contract had been terminated 'effective immediately' on an episode of the Today Show last week.

Lauer closed out by saying: 'All of us here at Today wish Billy the very best.'

Tamron Hall also acknowledged Bush's departure later in the show, saying: 'As a longtime member of the NBC family, we wish Billy all the best as he moves forward.'

Bush said in a statement following the announcement that he was 'deeply grateful' for the conversations he'd had with his three teenage daughters.

'I look forward to what lies ahead,' he added.

Although speculation has swirled regarding where Bush might go next - including to the rumored future Trump TV - he has not yet confirmed his next step.

Instead it seems Bush has been busy trying to return to life in Los Angeles, even putting up his luxury Manhattan townhouse on the market for $8.2million.

Bush had purchased the building for $8.8million just last December.

It was initially reported that Bush walked away from NBC with $10million, but both his lawyer and additional sources said the figure was inaccurate.

Instead it is believed NBC would only pay some of the remainder of Bush's $3million-a-year contract, according to CNN Money.

Exact details of the settlement are not known at this time but sources said the contract does not include a non-compete clause, meaning Bush can look for jobs at rivals stations.

Bush's attorney Marshall Grossman spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the interview with Trump, saying that Bush would have been risking his job if he had not laughed at Trump's statements and made lewd comments of his own.

'If Billy had been passive or responded ""Shut the f*** up"" to Trump, Billy would have been out of a job the next day,' said Grossman.

But one source told the Daily Mail Online that Bush had bragged about the tape while covering the Olympics this summer in Rio.

'What is stunning is how self-important Billy is,' the source said.

'Many people believe Access Hollywood management knew about this for much longer than they are saying and they were protecting Billy while not doing the right thing and informing NBC News.'

xkcd

Hey!  A fan pointed me over to where you had deleted the line about my working for NASA from the short article on me (Randall Munroe), labeling it """"patently made-up information"""".  Understandable and taken in good humor, of course, and nothing on the page is sourced (it's more of a stub than anything).  But I'm curious why you were so sure it was fabricated.  )  xkcd
I find it hard to believe that a 22-year-old could have been working full-time for NASA. Of course, you may well be freakishly gifted and the kind of person that NASA would have been all over, but it just seems ever so slightly hard to believe.  - Schreit mich an 
I interned there during college and started working for them a bit before I graduated.  I stayed for the better part of a year until late 2006.  NASA is a huge organization with a tremendous number of contract positions on all sorts of projects.  It's not all rocket scientists leaning over mission control screens and talking to astronauts on their headsets.

Anyway, the information is taken from my published bio page, but you're right  you have no way of knowing whether I'm lying or not.  I guess it's probably safest to assume that I am.
In that case, I'll admit my mistake and congratulate you on interning and working in a pretty impressive place (I know very little about science, but anyone who got to work for NASA has got to be a smart cookie in that kind of area). Feel free to re-add the info, although the impression I got from the original version was more than you weren't just a contract worker. If that's not even a valid distinction in the States - it's increasingly less of one here in Oz - then my apologies there in advance.  - Schreit mich an 
 Honestly, they never really explained to me which one I was.  I went to work every day in a building at NASA where I worked on NASA robots, and NASA paid me (through a government contractor).  When I said """"I work for NASA"""" no one argued.

 It was a lot more Dilbert-esque than you would expect.  Old, echoing tile hallways with quiet, gruff middle-aged men working at blueprint-covered desks, mild office politics, lots of presentations and buzzwords, and hours spent wading through computer code trying to figure out why the motor on the lab bench was spinning the wrong way.  I thought it sounded like the perfect place to work, and it was good in a lot of ways, but I was happy to leave.  xkcd

2663,"Jennifer Aniston Finally Pregnant At 48 Years Old? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have been married more than a year, so the inevitable pregnancy rumors will begin. According to the latest cover issue of Star Magazine, Jennifer Aniston is 'finally' pregnant at 48 years old.

Now, we've heard in the past that Jennifer Aniston has struggled to get pregnant, even back when she was married to Brad Pitt. In fact, one of the most persistent rumors is that Brad Pitt dumped Jennifer Aniston because she couldn't get pregnant, and he wanted children so badly. The fact that he went on to start a family with Angelina Jolie immediately after their divorce speaks to that rumor.

So poor single Jennifer struggled for a few years, until she met fellow famewhore-in-chief, Justin Theroux. The two stayed together, against all odds, and even decided to get married. And now, they are reportedly going to start having babies.

Sources tell Star, ""It's taken Jen and Justin 16 months of IVF treatments, and they've been through so much heartache along the way, but now it seems their baby dreams have finally come true."" The source also adds, ""I'm sure they've already planned to throw two baby showers in L.A., one for Jen and one for Justin, since this is his first time being a dad.""

Well, first – Jennifer Aniston pregnancy rumors are nothing new. We've heard this time and time again, and this is probably the 400th time that tabloids have come out with a Jennifer Aniston Is Pregnant! Cover. However, we have to question – could this time actually be true? You can only throw darts at the board for so long before they start sticking to the board, and this might be an instance where the tabloids have guessed about it or so long that it's now coming true.

However – even if Jennifer Aniston is pregnant (and that's a big if) – it is extremely unlikely that they're planning on throwing two baby showers; that seems excessive, even for them. While a pregnancy would undoubtedly be good news for the couple, they would probably want to keep it undercover – at least for a little while – and throwing two big baby showers isn't going to help them keep the news discreet.

Or heck, maybe they want the attention – they'll be able to use the pregnancy to sell their movies, TV shows, etc. Come back to CDL for all your Jennifer Aniston news and updates. Do you think Jennifer is pregnant this time?

We did not see this coming. Angelina Jolie’s worst Hollywood enemy, Chelsea Handler, might be getting a little too close to former lover Brad Pitt, according to a new report. Ouch!


It’s no secret that Chelsea Handler, 42, has never been a fan of Angelina Jolie. In fact, she’s been team Jennifer Aniston since the beginning. But now, the web of friendship and rivalry is all tangled up following a seriously shocking report from Naughty Gossip. The publication claims that the comedian is getting close to Brad Pitt, which kinda’ seems like a stab in the back for both Angie and the Friends alum. If true, how twisted is that?! “Chelsea never hated Brad for what he did to Jennifer,” a source tells Naughty Gossip on Aug. 17. “She always blamed Angelina for the nasty split. But now that she isn’t friends with Jen, Chelsea is free to work with Brad.”

Huh…apparently the bond between Chelsea and Jen wasn’t unbreakable like we once thought. But would the talkshow hostess really betray her (former) friend like that? Would things would Brad actually turn romantic? For now it sounds like Chelsea is only interested in collaborating with the Fight Club hunk professionally. “Chelsea has long been a fan of Brad’s ‘Plan B’ production company and is talking with them about a few projects,” the source continues. “Don’t be surprised if we see Brad and Chelsea having lunch together soon!”

We know what you’re thinking — when the heck did Chelsea and Jen stop being friends?! It was less than a year ago that the Horrible Bosses actress appeared on her show to gush about hubby Justin Theroux. “How was your Thanksgiving? Did you get a surprise?” asked Chelsea. “I did! I got a surprise! My husband!” Jen replied. The women had an absolute blast talking about the holidays, with no sign of a strained relationship. Never get a guy come between a friendship!

Harvey Weinstein says he will sue the New York Times for an estimated $50 million after it published a bombshell report claiming the movie mogul subjected actresses and female staffers to “decades of sexual harassment.”

Weinstein has hired Charles J. Harder — the LA attorney who brought down Gawker after winning a $140 million verdict for Hulk Hogan after the site posted a sex tape — to go after the Times, which posted its blistering exposé on the Oscar-winning Hollywood mogul Thursday.

Harder said in a statement on behalf of Weinstein, exclusively given to Page Six, “The New York Times published today a story that is saturated with false and defamatory statements about Harvey Weinstein. It relies on mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report, apparently stolen from an employee personnel file, which has been debunked by 9 different eyewitnesses. We sent the Times the facts and evidence, but they ignored it and rushed to publish. We are preparing the lawsuit now. All proceeds will be donated to women’s organizations.”

Harder did not say how much they planned to sue for, but sources said Weinstein would go after the publication for as much as $50 million.

Weinstein denies the accounts given by several female former employees to the Times, as well as details given by actress Ashley Judd, who says the mogul lured her up to his hotel room, where she alleged he appeared in a bathrobe and asked her to massage him or watch him shower.

The Times also reported that the powerful co-founder of Miramax negotiated at least eight payouts to women to keep them quiet, by asking them to sign confidentiality agreements barring them from speaking about the alleged harassment.

In a statement Thursday to The Post through attorney Lisa Bloom, Weinstein said, “I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then. I have since learned it’s not an excuse, in the office — or out of it. To anyone. I realized some time ago that I needed to be a better person and my interactions with the people I work with have changed. I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.”

Weinstein added he’s working with therapists and planning to take a leave of absence from his company to “deal with this issue head on.”

Weinstein is being advised by Bloom, who is a famed advocate for women.

""They basically told her that they are really just disappointed in how her and Blake seem to be lacking the in the love department this season.""

Jensen and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different IQ subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g,[107] which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability.[108] From these and other findings, they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis.[109]   3. The rising heritability of IQ with age (within all races; studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at 20% in infants, rises to 40% in middle childhood, and peaks at 80% in adulthood); and studies showing the virtual disappearance (~0.0) by adulthood of shared environmental effects on IQ (for example, family income, education, and home environment), with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in IQ than with strangers[110] From these studies, they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for IQ difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on IQ to fully account for group differences.
4. Studies of US comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races (85 for Blacks and 100 for Whites) across the entire range of IQs,[111] despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage, with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examined[112]

This seems to be excessive detail.  WRN has essentially recreated Rushton/Jensen arguments, and placed citations in his citation.  This essentially allows WRN to write an entire section, as if it were incontrovertible based on various references, without any possible response.  The NPOV fact that should be reported is that Rushton and Jensen make some assertions, not that they make some assertions, and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up.  If anything, every one of their """"lines of evidence"""" should be attributed directly to Rushton and Jensen, as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the """"genetic hypothesis"""", depending on the viewer.  It seems very weaselly, in any case.

2637,"Aquaman actresses Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard feuding on DC movie set?

James Wan started filming for Aquaman in Australia last month. While Jason Momoa and Mera actress Amber Heard have already shot their first scene together, Queen Atlanna actress Nicole Kidman reached a few days ago. Following her landing, there have reportedly been feud sparks on the sets.

The actress, who will be seen playing Momoa's mother in the movie, recently shared that she was excited to take on the role of the female warrior, but it looks like she does not like Heard's presence on the sets.

Also Read: Is something brewing between Aquaman Jason Momoa & Nicole Kidman on sets of DC movie?

According to a report by National Enquirer, it seems like there is an epic clash in making. The report claims that Kidman is not treating Heard like others on the set. The website's source shares that she has been giving Heard a cold treatment since the pre-production stage. But why?

National Enquirer claims that it has to do with Heard's divorce with Kidman's dear friend Johnny Depp. ""Nicole didn't like how Amber treated [her friend] Johnny Depp during their divorce,"" the source told the outlet.

""It doesn't help that [Kidman] has little respect for Amber as an actress,"" or that her role in the movie is ""bigger"" than Kidman's. ""She thinks Amber's getting by on social climbing and good looks rather than talent,"" adds the report. The website's source also added that Heard's ""forceful personality"" will ""guaranteed snap"" when Kidman arrives on set.

However, Gossip Cop's shares that there is no truth in these claims. Debunking the bogus claim, the website assures that the news is indeed fake.

The gossip website reached out to the Big Little Lies star and her rep guaranteed that there is no truth in the made claims. They also write that another source from the Aquaman movie sets shares with them that there are no issues between the two actresses.

While that has ended the possible speculations, new video shared by Heard show how much she is working out and preparing for her scenes in the movie. In a boomerang video she shared on Instagram, the actress is seen cart-wheeling with her trainer on the sets.

Whereas, Jason Momoa is busy rock climbing as he shares more videos from his training camp.

Aquaman is currently being filmed in Gold Coast in Australia and is slated for release on December 21, 2018.

2497,"Selena Gomez And The Weeknd Engaged, Planning For Summer 2017 Wedding?

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are reportedly ""getting married"" in August 2017.

According to a new report, Selena Gomez and her singer boyfriend, who are currently enjoying time together in Buenos Aires, are allegedly planning to make their relationship official after he wraps his Starboy: Legend of the Fall 2017 World Tour in August.

""[Selena Gomez] knows The Weeknd is her soul mate and doesn't want to spend years waiting to get married,"" a source told In Touch Weekly for their April 10 issue, via Hollywood Life.

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd have only been dating publicly for a few months, but according to the report, Gomez is moving forward full steam when it comes to planning their alleged wedding.

""[Selena Gomez] already has a wedding dress in mind,"" the source explained. ""She wants something classic; white, long and fitted to show off her amazing body. She's yet to choose a designer, but Versace, Giorgio Armani and Marchesa are at the top of her list.""

The In Touch Weekly insider claimed Selena Gomez and The Weeknd had several locations in mind for their potential wedding, including Lake Como in Italy, Venice, Florence and Paris. As fans may recall, Selena Gomez and The Weeknd embarked on a tour of Italy weeks after they confirmed their relationship with a joint outing in Los Angeles.

As for who may be in attendance at Selena Gomez and The Weeknd's allegedly upcoming nuptials, the magazine's insider claimed the pair was planning to keep things intimate.

""[Selena Gomez] and The Weeknd plan to only invite family and a few close friends,"" the source shared. ""Selena's cousin Priscilla DeLeon will be the maid of honor and her little sister, Gracie Teefey, will be a flower girl. It's going to be very small.""

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd have both been involved in highly publicized relationships in the past, and their own relationship is no different. After going public in January, the couple was seen spending time together in Los Angeles with French Montana and Jaden Smith, and a short time later, it was off to Italy where they were seen sightseeing in Venice and Florence.

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd also spent time in Europe in late February and early March as The Weeknd's tour stopped in several cities, including Amsterdam and Paris, and they later traveled to Toronto before their arrival in Argentina days ago.

Although Selena Gomez and The Weeknd haven't confirmed an engagement or plans to wed, a second source recently spoke out about their relationship and revealed that they are quite serious about their future.

""It's serious, very serious,"" an insider told Hollywood Life. ""The Weeknd has already told [Selena Gomez] that he loves her and vice versa. He speaks a couple of languages and has made sure to confess his love in English, French, Spanish and Amharic.""

""Whenever they travel to a new country, he tells her he loves her in that language,"" the source continued. ""He doesn't speak Portuguese, but learned how to say I love you [in the language]. Selena of course loves how romantic he is and melts every time he says those three little words, or two, depending on the language.""

Prior to her relationship with The Weeknd, Selena Gomez was involved in an on-and-off relationship with Justin Bieber, and when the ""Cold Water"" singer discovered news of the relationship, he wasn't happy. As for The Weeknd, he previously dated model Bella Hadid.

 Narciso Yepes 

Please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about. Yepes collaborated with Ramirez, not Bernabe, to invent his guitar. Bernabe (an apprentice of Ramirez) later formed his own shop and Yepes subsequently played a Bernabe 10-string. As for your comment about Yepes's hands, this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why Yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it (which was NOT to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think - including 10-string guitarists and clueless former students of Yepes). I have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available, depending on what best served the music. Do you have these proofs??? NO. So please stick to what you actually know. (FYI Yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first string's D together with the low G on the 6th string by using the left hand thumb. Again, we have the proof of this. It was even published in one of his old Scarlatti editions.)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 129.94.133.166   

 Your discussion at Narciso Yepes 

First, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most """"notorious""""...

Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. """"The Ten-String Guitar"""" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]

Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact """"worthless"""" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' """"short hands"""" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not """"frequently"""" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as """"crutches"""" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!

Could a Harry Styles and Kanye West duet be on the cards?


Splash News
Kanye is reportedly planning to haul Harry into the studio for a solo project - much to the annoyance of Simon Cowell.

Harry, who is rumoured to be dating Kendall Jenner, Kanye's soon-to-be half sister-in-law, was invited by Kanye to make sweet music together after a dinner at the Kardashians, according to Showbiz Spy.

""By the end of that evening, Kanye was inviting Harry to come into the studio to lay down some tracks. Simon freaked when he heard that!"" a source said.

But why is Simon so fuming, aside from the fact Harry will fuel One Direction split rumours with his antics? It's Kris Jenner (who asked Harry to be on Keeping Up With The Kardashians), that's got the high-trousered one in a grump:

""Simon knows how controlling and manipulative Kris is because he had dealings with her when Khloe Kardashian co-hosted the U.S. X Factor for one season.""

""He's really worried about losing control of Harry. He knows his lead singer's been thinking about a solo career, so the last thing he needs is the Kardashians and Kanye digging their claws into the One Direction star and trying to separate him from the rest of the band - not to mention Simon's record label!""

Whilst we're sure Harry can stand up for himself when it comes to Kris Jenner, we're more intrigued by the idea of a Hazza/Yeezus duet - WHAT would that sound like?!

Those keeping tabs on all things Kardashian will know that little sisters Kendall and Kylie appeared on US talk show host Chelsea Handler's show Chelsea Lately last night - and naturally, the ""H"" question was directed at Kendall.

When asked if she was dating Harry Styles, Kendall remained coy as ever, trying to bat away the question.

Chelsea went straight in for the kill, asking: ""Are you not public about your love lives?""

""No, we don't talk about it,"" the girls responded.

""So you're single (signalling to Kylie) and you're not dating Harry Styles (signalling to Kendall), is that his name?,"" Chelsea continued.

Kendall tried to avoid the question by looking flustered and giggling - refusing to either confirm or deny the claims as Chelsea joked about meeting the 1D hunk to Kendall, saying ""I don't know if you know him"".

The pair also talked about Kris Jenner and Bruce's recent divorce, with Kendall telling the E! show host:

""I think we're doing fine...It sucks not having a dad living with you but I talk to him everyday.""

It has been reported that the producers of Keeping Up With The Kardashians are eager to get One Direction's Harry Styles on the show.

Duh! Of course they do - it's Harry-blimming-Styles.


Rex Features
The trouble is, Harry ain't so keen, and has reportedly asked his rumoured new girlfriend Kendall Jenner NOT to film any scenes with or about him.

""Harry has told Kendall that he will not appear on Keeping Up With the Kardashians under any circumstances,"" sources told New York Daily News. ""Harry does not want his love life played out across the world on TV.

""Naturally, the producers want Harry on camera.""

Think about what would happen to those ratings…

Harry Styles and Kendall Jenner have sent the rumour mill into overdrive, having been snapped together by a fan.

The are they/aren't they pair have been spotted skiing together and fan Allie Connolly Instgrammed her chance meeting with them at a snowboard shop in Mammoth Lakes California.

""Casually hanging out with Kendall Jenner and Harry Styles. #dying.""

[instagram id=""ir9cKow4dA""]

However it seems Allie didn't expect the backlash from 1Directioners as she took to Twitter to defend the image, """"Lol now I have 14 year olds telling me that I was paid to make this a publicity stunt. Yep, you caught me hahahah,"" she wrote.

Harry and Kendall have been spotted together on numerous occasions, first stepping out for dinner in November.

Yet the pair have been keen to deny rumours that they are an item with Kendal telling E!that they ""are just friends,"" and Harry telling Piers Morgan that they are not dating and just went out for dinner.

On 16 December 2013, we wrote...

Another day, another picture emerging that suggests this Harry Styles/Kendall Jenner thing could be for real.


Rex Features
Dressed in a plaid shirt, blazer and jeans (after his Keith Richards-inspired headband and crucifix earring get-up on The X Factor), Styles was snapped arriving at Kendall's London hotel in the early hours of Sunday morning, after flying in from France where the band appeared at the NRJ Awards.

The pair have been romantically linked ever since they were seen leaving a restaurant together in Hollywood a month ago. Since then, they've been seen leaving a NYC hotel together and on a few restaurant dates, and they've followed each other on Instagram - which means they're practically MARRIED in celeb-ville.

Kendall took to Instagram to document her time in London - including this rather pretty picture of Big Ben:


Kendall and Harry have both been coy when asked about the relationship, insisting they are nothing more than friends. Question is, how many dinner dates/hotel visits will we hear about until 'Kenry' make their romance official?

On Tuesday, 10 December, we wrote...

More details have emerged regarding that Harry/Kendall date the One Direction star and budding model supposedly went on over the weekend.


Splash News
According to Us Weekly, Harry took Kendall to a gay bar in NYC, Hell's Kitchen's Therapy, for a special themed-night entitled ""Gays Gone Wild"".

The source added that Harry is a regular at said haunt, and although the pair didn't hit the dancefloor, he left ""holding hands"" with Kendall when the One Direction hit What Makes You Beautiful came on - for fear of the pair being recognised.

Earlier the same day, 'Kenry' caused a frenzy outside of NYC's Gansevoort hotel when they were pictured leaving together.

With Harry (who was in town for his performance on SNL) dressed in a peacoat and bandana, and Kendall in a crop top, jeans and military jacket, the pair were swamped by fans as they left the hotel to get breakfast. They have reportedly stayed in touch ever since the American Music Awards, with a source telling E! News:

""I've never seen Kendall happier and more fan friendly...They came off the elevator holding hands and then she stood and watched while he posed with fans.""

Although both have vaguely denied the dating rumours (Kendall simply said ""He's cool, yeah, he's cool... You go out with one person, you're automatically dating them"", whilst Harry told Piers Morgan ""dunno"" when asked to confirm their relationship status), this picture will no doubt send the rumour mill into a frenzy.

On Monday 25 November, we wrote...

Those Harry Styles and Kendall Jenner rumours? Probably not true, if both the parties involved are to be believed.


AKM-GSI
Obviously the internet got a *little* carried away when the two were snapped leaving a dinner date together last week (because having dinner together = married in celeb-land), and both Kendall and Harry denied the dating rumours (if a little coyly) over the weekend.

At the AMAs, Kendall was asked by the E!'s Giuliana Rancic on the red carpet if she was indeed dating Harry. Her response?

""We're friends. He's cool, yeah, he's cool... You go out with one person, you're automatically dating them.""

Meanwhile, when quizzed on a possible romance by TV interviewer Piers Morgan, Harry said:""I mean, we went out for dinner, but no, I guess.""

And when asked if a romance could be in the pipeline after the one dinner date, Styles simply replied ""dunno"".

So not exactly a complete denial - but not a glowing declaration of love either.

Stay tuned to see if 'Kenry' (yep, that's what people are calling them) really is on the cards.

On Thursday 21 November, we wrote...

Has the world imploded, or did we actually just see this picture of Harry Styles and Kendall Jenner?

The One Direction star and the Kardashian sister were spotted leaving Craig's restaurant together in Hollywood last night after apparently enjoying a dinner date.

Keen to keep the rendez-vous under wraps, the pair left out of a private backdoor exit. They were then seen driving away together in Styles' Range Rover.

The pair met at the X Factor USA studios, where One Direction recorded their performance for the show this evening (or so says Unreality TV).


It may be a little premature to assume that these two are officially an item, but the Mail Online have already Christened the pair Kenry (the new Kimye, y'all), so we're kind of hoping we're set to see a trans-Atlantic teen power-couple confirm their romance in the coming weeks.

The fact that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West plan to sign a prenuptial agreement probably won't come as a surprise to many, but recent claims on who is worth more probably will.

TMZ reported Kardashian and West will sign a prenup to keep their assets separate and form a joint account for living expenses. While other reports have pegged West's net worth about $100 million and Kardashian's about $40 million, TMZ says, ""[W]e're told Kim's actually worth more than Kanye.""

The ""Yeezus"" star may fancy himself a genius, but could Kardashian's celebrity brand be bringing in more dough?

The exact sum of their net worths might be unclear, but Forbes offers some information on their annual earnings thus far. According to those figures, however, the singer is still ahead of the reality starlet.

Currently, West ranks at No. 59 on Forbes' ""Celebrity 100"" list. As of June 2013, he has made $20 million. Forbes notes that his new album and tour will certainly increase this amount.

Meanwhile, Forbes ranks Kardashian at No. 66. As of June 2013, she has made $10 million from her reality show and business ventures. However, this is much lower than what she made in 2012 from cash related to her 72-day marriage to Kris Humphries. Another (made-for-TV?) wedding could be just the thing to boost that bank account back up.

On Thursday night, Kimye made their first public appearance since their engagement. They looked blissfully happy at Spago in Beverly Hills for the Dream for Future Africa Foundation Inaugural Gala, and Kardashian wasn't shy about flashing her 15-carat engagement ring for the paparazzi.

Mariah Carey is in talks to join The X Factor judging panel.

The Hero hitmaker is being lined up as a replacement for Nicole Scherzinger on the U.K. version of the singing competition, according to U.K. newspaper the Daily Mirror.

Producers at ITV have been in talks with the pop diva after the former Pussycat Doll is reportedly stalling over signing a new contract.

Mariah has previously served as a judge on American Idol, and with filming due to start in June (17), the 47-year-old is said to be ""really keen"".

""Mariah really wants to do it. Nicole is not committing at the moment, although she did meet up with Simon Cowell this week,"" a source told the newspaper.

Fellow judge Louis Walsh confirmed Nicole, who infuriated Andrew Lloyd Webber by pulling out of a Broadway show to join the judging panel last year (16), is the only judge not to have agreed a new deal.

""I hope everyone is on board this year, but I have heard Nicole has not signed. She might be getting a big movie like Wicked,"" Louis said, while revealing he, Sharon Osbourne and Simon Cowell were all returning to the ITV show.

However, if the 38-year-old singer does not return, Louis hinted they may enlist the help of Mel B, who previously judged on the show in 2014.

""Mel B’s done it before, so would be good, and she’s currently on the US (America's Got Talent) show with Simon,"" Louis added.

A spokesman for the X Factor said: ""No formal decision has yet been made regarding the full judging panel for The X Factor 2017.""

Could this former ""Friend"" be less than friendly in real life? Rumor has it that's the case.

The word on Jennifer Aniston's new movie set is that the 44-year-old doesn't socialize with her co-stars and whenever possible distances herself in her remote trailer, RadarOnline exclusively reports.

""Every day at lunch the entire cast and crew head to a cafeteria facility where they all sit down and eat lunch together for well over an hour,"" a source told RadarOnline. ""But the only person who doesn't eat with everyone else is Jen. She quickly grabs a lunch to go and leaves.""

According to RadarOnline's source, Aniston also gets a fancier SUV than everyone else's (including fellow stars Isla Fisher and Tim Robbins) and her trailer is situated way off set. All of these things make her seem ""not approachable,"" according to RadarOnline. But we can't help but wonder ... Is she being a obnoxious, or is she really just trying to hide a pregnancy?

Think about it: Pregnancy gives you weird cravings but also nausea (hence the lonesome lunches), and perhaps she doesn't want to undress in front of others who can catch a glimpse of her baby bump. Or maybe we're just really, really wishful thinkers.

Either way, this is not the first time Aniston has had ""diva"" rumors attached to her. A year and a half ago she admitted to throwing a chair at a director (!) but for a worthy cause: The man treated the script supervisor poorly and Jen later explained she couldn't stand aside and let him go on with it.

2672,"Kim Kardashian fails to congratulate Beyonce over twin pregnancy news while BFF Chrissy Teigen appears to mock superstar's announcement

The reality star did not join the list of stars tweeting their joy about Bey's good news

KIM Kardashian failed to share any reaction to Beyonce's record-breaking pregnancy announcement on her social media pages on Wednesday night.

Despite being active and chatting to fans on her Twitter account throughout the night, Kim opted not to follow in the lead of stars like Rita Ora and Rihanna and share public congratulations to the couple.

Kim's public silence did little to dispel the persistent rumours that the two superstars do not get along, despite reports the pair spent time together last year with their husband Jay Z and Kanye West.

Meanwhile, Chrissy Teigen nearly got in trouble with the Beyhive (the nickname for Beyonce's fans) after she appeared to mock the star's dramatic announcement.

As tweets and reaction pieces were taking over the internet, Chrissy wrote: ""Talk about a huge instagram announcement.""

Tthe accompanying picture was a screenshot which revealed the model had reached 10 million followers.

She then added: ""I am pregnant with 333.3333333333333333333333333333333333333 triplets.""

But just as fans began to express some anger towards her tweets, mother-of-one Chrissy added: ""But really. Congrats to my best friend Beyonce I love you so much. Hive forever.""

The first star to congratulate them was Jay Z's long-time friend Rihanna, who wrote: ""So excited about this news!!!! Congratulations to you @beyonce and my big bro Jay!!!""

Rita Ora, who was falsely linked to Jay Z as possibly ""Becky with the good hair"" after Lemonade was released last year, tweeted with the photo, ""Yay!!!!! Congratulations!!!!! soooooo beautiful!!!!!""

Model Hailey Baldwin said: ""I feel like I'm more excited for Beyoncé to be pregnant than I will be for my own child.""

Actress Brie Larson wrote: ""NO – YOU ARE CRYING BECAUSE BEYONCÉ IS HAVING TWINS.""

And Jurassic World star Bryce Dallas Howard declared: ""I think we all really needed this. #twins.""

Beyonce has claimed the title of having the most liked picture Instagram thanks to her artistic pregnancy announcement.

Wearing a berry coloured bra and a pair of pale blue frilly knickers, the 35-year-old knelt on an elaborate display of roses with a sheer veil over her head.

As she looked directly into the camera, the singer cradled her already visible bump.

She captioned it: ""We would like to share our love and happiness.

""We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters.""

Beyonce didn't give any further details of when the babies will arrive, but their arrival will come five years after the couple welcomed their first child, daughter Blue Ivy, in January 2012.

The happy news comes nine years after the couple tied the knot in a private wedding ceremony in April 2008.

The star later revealed she had miscarried a child around 2010, describing it as the ""saddest thing"" she had ever been through.

Thankfully they were blessed with daughter Blue Ivy in 2012, but in the last couple of years, the pair had been dogged by rumours they were intended to divorce, not expand their family.

However the latest announcement finally shuts down the speculation once and for all, with the family now looking forward to their new arrivals.

2472,"Sarah Jessica Parker Inherits Vogue Magazine Control From Anna Wintour? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

There's only one Anna Wintour, but there's only so long that she can run Vogue. Anna's now 64 years old, and while she's still got plenty of years to keep running Vogue, her reign isn't going to last forever. Eventually, she will have to find a successor, and according to a report from Radar Online, that successor will be Sarah Jessica Parker.

Now, before you laugh yourself to sleep, listen to Radar's reasoning. Sarah and Anna are friends, and have been friends for a very long time, thanks to the long running popularity of Sex and the City. Vogue owes a huge debt to the show for putting it on the map, especially since the magazine didn't use to be the household name it is now.

Anyway, Radar's source explains, ""Anna is worrying colleagues who believe she has found her true successor in Sarah! It's a surprising idea, but one that is not entirely a joke. Anna thinks Sarah, a fashion icon on Sex and the City, truly has what it takes to step into her shoes and take on a role at Vogue one day. Although Wintour has made no announcements about when she might retire, her scheme to put Parker in the Vogue pipeline has co-workers shaking in their own designer shoes.""

You know, the idea's not as far-fetched as it sounds. Sarah's very fashion savvy, and while she doesn't seem like she'd be able to run Vogue as well as Anna [who would?], she does have the contacts and image to keep the brand name strong.

What do you guys think? Is Anna Wintour grooming Sarah Jessica Parker to take over Vogue for her? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

 Silesians 

Andrew, I have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you. I have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the English Wikipedia. I am sorry you had a negative experience with the German Wikipedia, but that is a separate project from this English project. Assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the English Wikipedia; I advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst. I inquired about Silesian/Polish because Silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group. I am not sure what you mean by """"reverting the article upside down""""; my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles. As I do not anticipate being able to copy-edit the article further, I am removing it from my watchlist. Good luck with the article. Olessi  

Thanks for you comments, and in fact fruitful discussion. You are right that the work of a person is most important.
However, there are much present and past propaganda, which destroy the peace. If only some people would show objectivity and patience, as you did, it could be clear up. To mention nationality is however important, since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation. (Unfortunately, nations or ethnic groups will still exist. I have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them, and fair competition. Seems to me that competition has to exit too – best if for fun only.)
I am conscious that English and German Wikipedias are separate projects, but you see, when I approach German Wiki, Dzierzon article the Polish relevant article was attacked by some German/Silesian/Polish guy. It cost me more then here on En Wiki to settle the Pl article well. So sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude, possibly I explained more my excitement.

With Silesian is in short like this: Originally, they were Slavic tribe, spoke Polish, as I mentioned. For some 300 to 500 hundred years there were under German governments. They had bad time as you possibly can imagine. Many of them married with German and were/are of course confused who they are. You know, the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course Polish-German conflicts continued. Finally in 1945 Poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives. Even those who honestly considered himself Polish Silesians at the end of war could be persecuted. There in Poland was complete disorder. Soviets and Communists arrived, most of them real simpletons any way. “National” government - just pro-soviet mafia, was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition. Polish borders were shifted. We lost some 20% of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west Poland. You can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all, some of them completely simple people. They spoke different Polish dialect also. On top of this in the post war, pro-soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground. Well, I do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds – unfortunately I am. This is like gangrene on fresh wound, literally. Thus many of the native Silesian could be robber in Poland, which they wanted so much. I believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be Germans.

Now, the present time, some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology – they could be absolutely right. However, there are many Germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal Polish affairs - despite the final border agreement between Poland and Germany signed on 14 November 1990 and governments effort to improve relations.
Finaly I have to say, I beleave that Polish are hospitable and very often naïve. Not many realize that politic need caution. Those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the naïves. Some procentage remember lectures of history, and objectively, too many Germans are toublemakers. I am also convinced there exists something like national character. You can have obviously you own opinion, let me have my own.
Returning to Silesians it is something close to squaring the circle . I wish the true Silesian all the best but I do not want Fith Column  on Polish terytory in addition.

Sorry if I used posibly ofencive """"reverting the article upside down"""" that was in the heat of the battle, wich I still have with Ge Wiki. They just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext. That sucks.

Sorry and thanks again. Feel free to contact me any time you need.

Celebrities including LAVERNE COX, ROB LOWE and RUSSELL SIMMONS have taken to social media to congratulate CAITLYN JENNER for her powerful acceptance speech at the ESPYS on Wednesday night (15Jul15).

 The former Olympic gold medal-winning athlete made her first major public appearance since her transition from male to female at the annual sports prizegiving to receive the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, given to those who show “strength in the face of adversity”.

 She received a standing ovation as she went onstage and broke down in tears as she discussed her transformation and thanked her family, who were in the audience, for their support and acceptance of her new identity.

 Several celebrities later took to Twitter.com to applaud the emotional speech, with fellow transgender star Laverne Cox writing, “Just caught @Caitlyn_Jenner’s speech at the #ESPYS. So deeply moved. I feel like an historic moment happened for my community tonight. Thanx (sic)”

 Lowe adds, “Caitlyn Jenner CRUSHED her beautiful speech at the #ESPYAwards” while Simmons posts, “Respect to @Caitlyn_Jenner. Beautiful, moving, inspiring speech tonight at the #Espys. We are a better people because of your courage.”

 The Roots musician Questlove writes, “All Respect Due @Caitlyn_Jenner #ESPYS” while Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ex-wife, author Maria Shriver, adds, “#CaitlynJenner film, wow! Her speech: even better. Accept all for who they are #ESPYS”

2412,"Jennifer Aniston Cheated On Brad Pitt With Matt LeBlanc While Married? - Report

Brad Pitt, 51, may not have been the only one with a wandering eye during his marriage to Jennifer Aniston, 46. An explosive new interview with Matt LeBlanc's dad, Paul LeBlanc, reveals that the actress actually cheated on her then-husband with her Friends co-star long before Brad met Angelina Jolie, 40, on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith!

""He had fun, that's for sure,"" Paul tells Star Magazine of his son's time on Friends. ""He even had a relationship with one of the girls...Jen. They would make out in the dressing rooms. He told me about it - it was when she was married to Brad Pitt."" OH SNAP!

Don't forget, Jen and Matt's characters had a brief fling on the show at the end of Season 9 and beginning of Season 10, so the whole situation is like life imitating art! And considering Friends ended in 2004, and Brad and Angelina didn't get together until shortly after that, then, if what Paul's saying is true, it means Jen actually cheated first.

This shocking claim could totally change the way we think about the Brad/Jen/Angelina love triangle forever, because it would mean that the Cake star is no longer an innocent victim. However, Paul also noted in Star's interview that he had a falling out with Matt three years ago, and aren't on the best of terms. Do you trust his credibility? ""It is absolutely 100 percent false!"" Jen's rep tells HollywoodLife.com. ""Jennifer has never had a romantic or sexual relationship with Matt LeBlanc.""

Either way, everyone in this whole situation has CLEARLY moved on from whatever happened ten years ago. To everyone's surprise, Brad and Angelina's relationship stayed strong - they have six kids together and were married in Aug. 2014. Meanwhile, Jen has been engaged to Justin Theroux since Aug. 2012.

2759,"Spry on her 95th birthday, Betty White offers some life advice
Beloved Emmy-winning actress and animal advocate Betty White turned 95 on Tuesday. To mark the occasion, the living legend sat down with Yahoo’s Katie Couric to share some of her secrets to living a long and fruitful life. “I am the luckiest old broad on two feet,” she acknowledged.

See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour »

As a birthday gift, Couric brought White a stuffed sloth, which led to the revelation that the birthday girl has an entire room in her home dedicated to stuffed animals.

“I’m a little strange for stuffed animals,” said White. “I’m a little strange for any kind of animals.”

When asked about a typical day in her life, White said she always gets up early, though in her case, she has a little help via a quick puppy kiss.

“[My dog] comes over and he lets me know when it’s 6:30,” said White.

Though married twice before, White got married for the last time in 1963 to television host Allen Ludden. The pair were happily wed until Ludden’s death from stomach cancer in 1981.

Also a widow, having lost her first husband to colon cancer in 1998, Couric asked White if she had advice for women who found themselves in their position.

“One day at a time,” White said, shaking her head. “You don’t look ahead. And you try not to look back.”

And did she ever want to get married again? “Remarry, no,” she said. “Fool around, sure!”

White, who still has an active career in Hollywood — she even hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 2010 — stressed to Couric the importance of filling your time.

“Don’t focus everything on you,” advised White. “That wears out pretty fast. It’s not hard to find things you’re interested in. Enjoy them. Indulge them.”

Beyond her professional work, White has spent her life committed to being an advocate for animal health and is known for her close relationship with the Los Angeles Zoo.

2626,"FKA Twigs Looks Miserable With Robert Pattinson At Cannes Film Festival | Celeb Dirty Laundry

FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson are reportedly going strong. The Twilight star and his fiancée attended the 2017 Cannes Film Festival this week. The couple didn’t look as happy as they are reported to be. It’s been months since fans have seen FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson together.

They keep their relationship low-key for the most part. It’s probably because FKA Twig has to deal with the crazy Twilight fans bugging her on social media. She looked really sour when they went to the red-carpet premiere of Robert Pattinson’s latest movie Good Time.

Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs were glowing on the red carpet. While Robert Pattinson seemed ecstatic to be there, his girlfriend struggled to smile during the event. FKA Twigs stood beside him in a busy Dior gown that she paired her look with nude fuzzy boots and a black choker with a gold crucifix hanging from it.

The Daily Mail noticed that she kept looking at the floor as she walked out of their hotel to head to the screening. Robert Pattinson kept it classic with his black tuxedo.

He was later joined by co-stars Taliah Webster and Buddy Duress, writer and co-director Ben Safdie, and co-director Joshua Safdie. Robert Pattinson reportedly got engaged to FKA Twigs back in August 2015. The couple has kept their relationship out of the public eye as much as possible. Despite stepping out together at public events, they rarely speak out about their relationship. Though FKA Twigs has said that the public attention that she has garnered is “100 percent worth it.”

She told The Observer back in 2014 that she is not who she portrays on the red carpet. She only attends these events to support “the man that I love.” She also remarked about the media who scrutinizes every move on her red carpet. FKA Twigs admits that she looks uncomfortable at red carpet events because they are not her thing. But, that doesn’t stop her from loving and supporting Robert Pattinson.

Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs were all smiles when they celebrated his 31st birthday earlier this month in Culver City, Los Angeles. The actor beamed and even displayed PDA with FKA as they joined friends at an intimate party at Akasha restaurant. However, FKA Twigs seemed engaged with her phone every time Robert Pattinson was talking about something. The couple were later seen hugging and kissing each other outside the venue.

Comment Hi There, In spite all my effort, I don’t expect any understanding or help from the other side regarding the English version of the article about Alexander Voytovych. Therefore if one insists on deleting this particular article then go ahead as it seems to me there is no room for democratic thinking on your website whatsoever. I’d like to add a few more words as my final statement. Wikipedia says:  “Sources may encompass published works in all forms and media, and in any language. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability. The art works and art life of the artist is the sourcefor academic press, Ukrainian media, academic institutions, as well as poets, writers and publications use his paintings & drawings to illustrate books. The artist takes a part in a busy art life in the Ukraine presenting a number of exhibitions & art projects. Having said that I see that there is no enough evidence for one?????

If one convinced that the article has to be deleted, than do not hesitate to do so, but before that please give me a straight answer to my question. What is the difference between the article about Alexander Voytovych and, for example, the Herb Roe’s article, why the mentioned article is considered more accurate? I must highlight once again that instead of explaining what has to be changed or corrected on the page, one awards us with thenoticeboards. Regarding self-promotion  which was mentioned a few times I’d like to make it clear  the artists is a Ukrainian and naturally all sources are Ukrainian, and if the mentioned language is unknown to one it doesn’t meant that it allows one doubts the genuine sources. The Ukrainian and Russian versions of Wikipedia have accepted the article and honoured it, which says a lot.I had in my mind to present more Ukrainian artist, however having such an experience; I’d rather leave this business behind thanks to you. Thanks for co-operation. From my point of view this discussion is exceeded, feel free to delete the article!

247,"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

2155,"===Belated Merry Christmas and Hello from N.Srinivasan: a few submissions on contradictions in Indian History pages: Thanks for your affirmative action in unlocking history pages:=

Dear Tiptoety,

I request you to have a careful look at the pages of history edited by User Dinesh Kannambadi who while claiming to source material from ‘reliable’ sources, is at the same time indulging in feeding of completely unverified and unreliable pieces of information.

This communication from me may kindly be regarded by you as one among a series of interactions with you with my sole aim being the betterment of history pages of Wikipedia and nothing else. 

It has been my experience while trying to contribute to history pages or indeed indulge in discussions for betterment of Wikipedia pages, whatever we do users like Dinesh Kannambadi have objected to always and have branded our contributions as vandalism and sourcing from POV websites etc.  

Just take note of the contradictory nature of his editing of history pages especially on the Chalukya Empires especially with reference to the Chola Empire (pls. also remember that in Wikipedia for God knows what reason, the pages on the Chola Empire have been christened as Chola Dynasty despite that the fact that the Cholas prospered at the helm of an empire having large territories not just in India but also overseas including Sri Lanka, Maldives, very large parts of South East Asia for at least 150 years of their existence.  Here are the examples: but before that I would like to say this that deliberately, user Dinesh Kannambadi has been trying to mention or project the Chalukya dynasty as some sort of a contemporary of the Chola empire and has even gone on to mention the demise of the Chola empire (saying that the Chola territories were taken over by the Pandiyas), which has a great weakness:  

the Chalukya dynasty had very weak kings from 1126 onwards and between 1135/1140 to 1175 their kings were displaced and the Kalachuris under Bijjala I and Bijjala II ruled Kannada country in India.  The Chalukyas did make a comeback but that was for just 10-15 years between 1185 to 1198 after which they went into oblivion.  I request  that you may kindly contrast this with the fate of the Cholas, whose kings from AD 1170 though were not as strong as their kings between AD 848-1165, yet one of their last great kings Kulothunga III on the strength of epigraphical and inscriptional evidence is said to have occupied Madurai, Karur and Sri Lanka (then known as Ilangai) between 1185-1200 AD.  He ruled for around 45 years though near the end of his rule he was indeed routed by the Pandiyans and held on to his empire with great difficulty, having Hoysalas as his allies.  Yet, even with weak kings following him after 1218, the Cholas lasted till 1279, when their last king lost to the Pandiyas and the Cholas went into oblivion.  

Contrast the above i.e. the demise of the Cholas in 1279 or 1280 to that of the Chalukyas, who were first of all without a capital for over 35 years and re-emerged for just 10-15 years and became history by AD 1195 or thereabouts.  Yet, jingoism seems to get the better of user Dinesh Kannambadi and he has written in the Western Chalukya Empire page as under:  the link is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Chalukyas and the relevant portion of text is the following:

“This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.”
Though (technically speaking at least) as per the version of Dinesh Kannambadi, the Chalukyas fell and demised in 1191/1195 and the Cholas demised after almost 9 decades in about 1279/80…. i.e. within a hundred years of each other… I would like to raise the question what is the justification for his expression …”This period saw the fall of two great empires…”  I mean what is meant by “this period” surely if both empires had fallen within two or three decades of each other, then the expression could be a little contemporaneous… but even as a weak empire the Cholas lasted till 1280 almost 84 years after the Chalukyas demised.. then what is the reason and justification for mentioning the demise of the Cholas when the subject on the page i.e. the Chalukya dynasty, which went into oblivion in the year 1191 or 1195???? 

The point is that whether it is mentioning the Hoysalas another Kannada empire or the Chalukyas, he is obsessed with their portrayals as some sort of contemporaries of the Cholas.. even while mentioning Chalukya architecture, user Dinesh Kannambadi cannot resist bringing in the Cholas;;; see this write u",0

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L",1

2681,"Aid worker claims Angelina Jolie adopted son Maddox using fake details

A Cambodian aid worker is making extraordinary claims about Angelina Jolie's 2003 adoption of eldest son Maddox Jolie-Pitt.

Mounh Sarath, 51, told Britain's The Sun on Sunday that he signed official papers in Cambodia claiming he was Maddox's father in order to help speed along the boy's adoption all those years ago.

He also claims he still has legal power of attorney over the now-teenager and showed The Sun on Sunday the adoption document filed with a court in Cambodia's Battambong province in August 2003 to back up his claims.

He explained the lie, telling the paper, ""She had to change his name, so the only way was for me to do it. I said he's my son.""

""In court documents, Maddox is still my son,"" he said. ""She never cleared this up.""

Despite his claims, there is no evidence that either Angelina, 41, or then-husband Billy Bob Thornton, 61 -- who was also involved in Maddox's adoption before he and Angelina divorced -- knew what Mounh did.

According to MailOnline, Angelina has previously said she went to ""great lengths to ensure Maddox did not have a living birth mother in Cambodia"" and that she would ""never rob a mother of her child.""

Maddox's adoption took place at a time when the United States was imposing tougher restrictions on adopting kids from Cambodia because of trafficking concerns.

Lauryn Galindo -- the adoption agent who handled Angelina and Maddox's case -- spent time in prison after reportedly falsifying the names, birth dates and birth places of Cambodian children who were adopted by Americans. (She denied this at the time, telling ABC's ""20/20,"" ""I have never been involved or charged with anything other than paperwork errors. And that's what I pled to, that's what I'm going to go to prison for.""

While making his serious claims, Mounh -- who met Angelina through charity work -- also revealed he and the star have since fallen out. ""I would be happy if Cambodia didn't see her again,"" he said.

Angelina was in Cambodia in February to promote ""First They Killed My Father,"" a movie she directed for Netflix about the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian genocide. Maddox worked on the film.

Neither Angelina nor soon-to-be ex-husband Brad Pitt, who legally adopted Maddox after settling down with Angelina, have commented on the claims.

In addition to Maddox, the former couple are also parents to son Pax, 13, who was adopted from Vietman; daughter Zahara, 12, who was adopted from Ethiopia; and biological children Shiloh, 10, who was born in Namibia, plus 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, who were born in France.",0

Now, I don't know if there was a name change in 1923 and then another in 1926, but if there was, it will need another reference to support it. Here is what Pospelov says, verbatim:

then move on to basics. keep the bitcoin protocol details out of the article since you already split off the page about the protocol. the shortest description Ive read is: """"When a transaction is broadcast to the network, it is relayed with a digital fingerprint that identifies it. Bitcoin miners scoop it up, verify it, and send it on to the rest of the network for confirmation.

2495,"Taylor Swift: The Real Reason She Gave Selena Gomez The Challenge

Now we know one of the reasons why Taylor Swift, 24, nominated Selena Gomez, 22, for the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge on Aug. 16. A source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Taylor suggested Selena to take the icy plunge to see if she'd ""really listen"" to Taylor this time (since she doesn't about Justin Bieber, 20) and actually do it.

We've learned EXCLUSIVELY that Taylor believes Selena never listens to her and she nominated Selena for the challenge to see if she'd really accept.

""This is actually a test for Selena, since she doesn't listen to Taylor ever when it comes to advice she wants to see if she'll actually listen to her and do the ALS challenge,"" a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.

Selena recently got back together with her on-again-off-again beau Justin, and Taylor's not exactly his biggest fan. She was so ""proud"" of Selena for dumping Justin, but Selena couldn't resist reuniting with Justin after he agreed to go to ""spiritual counseling together."" We previously reported that Taylor was ""sick of Selena telling her one thing and then going back to Justin.""

Selena did accept the challenge and thanked Taylor, or ""T-Swizzy,"" for the nomination. Selena posted the video of her getting soaked with icy cold water a few hours after Taylor completed the challenge with her friend Jamie King, 35. Selena said she was also going to donate money and decided to nominate  Cara Delevingne, 22, Suki Waterhouse, 22, and James Franco, 36! Justin also took part in the icy challenge.

We're just glad to see Taylor, Selena and Justin all become a part of the fight to raise awareness for ALS. The more support the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge gets the better.

Despite Taylor's advice and Justin's partying ways, Selena is back together with Justin. Justin is on ""cloud nine"" since reuniting and a source revealed that he told her that she was ""his soulmate and couldn't live without her."" So sweet!

The two were spotted out together on a lovely day in California on Aug. 16. Justin was goofing around and Selena was seen laughing in the video! Later on in the day, Justin posted another video rapping a love song likely to Selena!

What do YOU think, HollywoodLifers? Do you think Taylor used the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge to see if Selena would finally listen to her? Let us know!

2752,"Gwen Stefani is returning to 'The Voice,' but what about Miley Cyrus?


Gwen Stefani is all set to return to the hot seat on ""The Voice,"" but whose chair is she snatching?

NBC announced Tuesday that Stefani would rejoin the judge's panel in February for Season 12 of the reality singing competition, taking the place of current judge Miley Cyrus.

Stefani, who previously served as a judge on seasons seven and nine, will be seated alongside relative newcomer Alicia Keys, who joined the show in Season 11 (currently airing), as well as original judges Adam Levine and Blake Shelton.

""We can't wait to experience the unique chemistry and energy Gwen, Alicia, Blake and Adam will bring to season 12,"" said Paul Telegdy, president of NBC Entertainment's alternative and reality group, in a statement released Tuesday morning.

But Cyrus fans, take heart. NBC also announced today that the artist would rejoin ""The Voice"" as a judge in Season 13, scheduled to air in fall 2017, with the rest of the judging panel yet to be determined.

""With Miley returning for season 13, we're truly ecstatic about the unmatched musical know-how and talent coming together in our coming seasons,"" Telegdy said.

Stefani's return to ""The Voice"" means she'll be reunited with beau Blake Shelton. The pair began dating during Stefani's second stint judging the series during Season 9, in the wake of each artist's divorce.

""The Voice"" continues to be a ratings hit for NBC, with seasons nine and 10 airing during the 2015-16 television series averaging 13.3 million viewers per episode.

ANNE Hathaway has been accused of acting like a diva and submitting a long list of demands before a cancer charity event in Santa Monica earlier this month.

The Les Miserables star allegedly submitted a long list of demands before agreeing to attend the Pink Party Gala in Santa Monica on October 19.

A source told In Touch magazine that the Oscar-winner's team were ""really concerned"" she would be bombarded by fans for photos and autographs at the event, and an email was sent to staff with a series of strict guidelines.

The insider added: ""Everyone was asked not to talk to her.""

The email, obtained by gossip website RadarOnline.com, also noted that other stars, who attended made no such demands.

The staff email stated: ""I know in the past our hosts have mingled in the party, but each person is different. We are trying to respect her space.""

A source also claimed that even though staff adhered to Anne's list of demands, the actress was very unfriendly.

The source said: ""She was so rude and acted like a b***h to a few people she did speak to. She just sat there rolling her eyes all night.""

Anne, 30, also attended the Victory Fund Champagne Brunch in Beverly Hills with her husband, Adam Shulman, on October 20, where she broke down in tears as she took to the stage to introduce cancer specialist Dr. Beth Karlan, who recently helped her friend beat the disease.

A J.D. is a Doctor of Jurisprudence same as a Ph.D.   Why do you allow personal information that's good for you but not for others who might be interested in knowing more?  He was important enough to post an article so why do you think any reader will be satisfied with a sum total of data saying  he owns a rental property in Agoura Hills with a meaningless political contribution?  The property posted is a rental  where he no longer lives and maybe never did.   How is that useful in an article about organized labour? You said it yourself the article should be about the company.  But in actual fact, he IS the company.    He's a flight instructor whom I know from our FBO (Flight Base Operation).  Lots of people know him.   He hasn't contributed to Republicans for years.  Look at the site you  provided!!  Last one was 2004.  Why continue to keep outdated useless information?

I am a lawyer and Logan is a British economist, and may understand E.U. law but does not understand U.S. labor law.  Just because he writes about it does not mean he understands it.  There is NO newspaper article about CDN that says employees were awarded from the Court of Appeals.  He wrote incorrectly.    The citation provided which corrects his article  is  from the court dockets.  Which is a better citation?    I provided the citation from  the law firm that WON the civil case against CDN!!   I removed nothing  about the case itself.... only corrected the information in such a way that the non legal lay person could understand the fundamental differences between NLRB law and DOL law and civil actions filed with the District Courts.   What John Logan wrote that you cite is liking saying someone was cited by the F.A.A. but tried at the D.M.V.!!!  Are you British?  F.A.A. is Federal Aviation Admin. and D.M.V. is Dept. of Motor Vehicles.  They are not related anymore than NLRB is to District Court or civil cases..   Burke works in NLRB jurisdiction and the case you cite is a Civil Action in District Courts not related.    If you want CDN  discussed,  first part is fine but the civil action is not.  there should be another topic developed in wikipedia for CDN.    Logan's article  used as a citation  lacks any credible legal citation connecting Burke to the civil case.   Only a legal citation should be used.   There are none available.    DJB is a very well known person and lots of lawyers both company and union know him. No matter which side of the aisle...this information is flawed.    If you are going to discuss legal issues then get them right.  Am I being picky?  Yes.  Inside the law you can't just throw something at the ceiling and hope it sticks.   Deleting FACTS for FICTION is beneath the dignity of what Wikipedia has strived to promote.    Why do you say the article contains everything anyone needs to know to justify deleting contributions?

Jennifer Aniston is an A-list movie star and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that's exactly what she acts like on set.

While in Connecticut filming the Untitled Elmore Leonard Project with other famous faces like Isla Fisher, Tim Robbins and Will Forte, a source close to the set says the former Friends actress doesn't socialize with any of the cast or crew and purposely keeps herself removed as much as possible.

""Every day at lunch the entire cast and crew head to a cafeteria facility where they all sit down and eat lunch together for well over an hour,"" the insider exclusively told RadarOnline.com.

""But the only person who doesn't eat with everyone else is Jen. She quickly grabs a lunch to go and leaves.""

The source also claims Jen, 44, has fancier transportation than everyone else - as well as a trailer that is much farther away from the set than anybody else's.

""All the actors ride in normal production vans when they head to lunch, but Jen has her own luxury SUV,"" the source said.

""And not only is Jen's private trailer miles away from the set, but she heads all the way back there each day to eat her lunch away from everyone else.""

The source concluded by telling RadarOnline.com that Jen isn't outwardly rude to anyone on set, but that she just acts like a diva and it's off-putting to those around her.

""Her behavior is a clear indicator to everyone that she's not approachable,"" the source said.

""And it's just unnecessary. There's no reason why she has to act any better than anyone else on that movie set.""

 Why will Gwen Gale not read the sources? 

On 01:27, 5 August 2010 I posted a section on """"Talk: Death of Adolf Hitler"""" titled “Random Questions” which started “I am not a scholar, I read Wiki but would not think of editing it. But I was disappointed in this article, and many points in the discussion, so I am asking some questions. Perhaps someone else will read and address them.” The section went on with several rethoritical questions, and ended with “As to sources, the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by Hugh Thomas (sort of shaky) and The Last Days of Hitler by Anton Joachimsthaler (English translation, I buy much of this).”

Gwen Gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator, because at  she replied with: ”As the article lead says,...This said, this talk page isn't a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic, it's meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. I say this because the article seems to already cover, with thorough citations, most if not all of what you've brought up...dodgy. Gwen Gale (talk)”

By this reply it appears that Gwen Gale is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of Joachimsthaler, who I have just referenced, and thinks that I am asking a personal question, not a rhetorical one. At that time I apologized, tried to explain myself, and restate my questions.

At  I posted” If I had read Kershaw's Nemesis Chapter 17 note 156 and Epilogue note 1 I wouldn't have wasted your time. You can't get much clearer than that. Should be required reading. Perhaps someone else should read them, and possibly edit the article. Thank you for your time.99.41.251.5 (talk)”

At  I posted “I would like to direct people to the work of Ian Kershaw Hitler, 1939-1945: Nemesis ISBN 0393322521. Chapter 17 and the epilogue relate to this article. Please pay attention to his notes and sources. Be warned, his book Hitler: a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....The source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a German's analysis of 1950's post-Soviet interviews of bunker survivors. The original transcripts must be available somewhere. There are many other bunker interviews, some with questionable intent, and not all agree. Wm5200 (talk)“

Since those posts I have posted a huge amount on the talk page, virtually all of which Gwen Gale has disputed. Much of the material I have posted I have later deleted, often because I felt that the endless conflict between Gwen Gale and myself is counterproductive to the article. 

Anyone who is Wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. Was I sometimes rude and argumentative? Absolutely. Was I making legitimate points which related to the article? I thought so. Did I receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? I think not, but you judge.

My main point was that Joachimsthaler had reviewed the information, and had made a solid case for positions which Kershaw backed. I repeatedly begged anyone, especially Gwen Gale, to read Joachimsthaler and Kershaw, specifically, two footnotes, I even told the pages of the footnotes. Gwen Gale clearly had not read either source.

 I posted, under the heading “Question for Gwen Gale” , the following: ”I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.

2452,"Has Tom Hiddleston's 'Embarrassing' Romance With Taylor Swift Cost Him a Job?

Yikes, Tom Hiddleston and Taylor Swift's romance (showmance?) really isn't having the effect that their PR teams had hoped for, with Tom reportedly losing a huge contract due to the ""embarrassing"" display.

Last month it was reported that fashion giant Armani was considering using Tom as its new face, replacing Taylor's ex, Calvin Harris. (Interesting!)

However, it seems the Italian label has gone lukewarm on the idea due to Hiddleston's recent publicity-hungry antics with his new girlfriend.

Executives apparently fear that they will be seen as ""cashing in"" on the drama, something that they are eager to completely disassociate themselves from.

A source shared: ""Tom was on the shortlist as they examined who could take over from Calvin.""

""Obviously with Tom now being Taylor's other half and the Calvin past deal, it would generate huge media coverage and headlines.

""But Armani see themselves as classier than that and think that a rising sports star may suit their current needs better. Armani would hate to be seen as getting PR for their brand by riding on Taylor Swift's coattails, so Tom will not get the job.""

The insider continued: ""While Tom is without doubt one of the sexiest actors of his generation, he may not be the right fit this time.

""The brand is looking at attracting 30-somethings and under, so Tom may be a little too old."" Ouch.

Tom hit the headlines when he was conveniently photographed embracing Taylor on an isolated beach less than three weeks after she had split from her long-term boyfriend, Calvin.

The pair has embarked on a eyebrow-raising display of love across the globe, with Taylor even meeting Tom's mother in front of the waiting photographers after just nine days of dating.

Tom was relentlessly mocked after donning an ""I [heart] Taylor Swift"" tank top during Fourth of July celebrations and wondered if that might have a negative impact on his career (while others wondered if it was just a joke).

If Armani is indeed shying away from the star, that negative impact might be painfully real.

Last night, the world officially went into meltdown after Beyoncé announced she and Jay Z were expecting twins.

With the help of contemporary artist Awol Erizku, Queen Bee shared her exciting news on social media, showing the veiled mother-to-be caressing her stomach, surrounded by reams of flowers, in what has now become the most liked Instagram picture of all time.

Hours later, the rumour mill went into overdrive, with several conspiracy theories popping up.

Some of them questioning the timing of her announcement, others interpreting the Instagram post like its a James Joyce epic poem. Soon, there will be more illuminati claims and eventually someone is bound to figure that she's not really pregnant at all and that it was all a ruse.

Let's have a look at the ideas that have been floated so far.

Firstly, many astute BeyHive fans were quick to point out the Lemonade star might have given us a hint about her pregnancy via Instagram six weeks ago.

In a post to Instagram before Christmas, the 'Halo' singer shared a slideshow of photos of herself in a suede navy dress and silver antlers, which show her in back-to-back photos appearing to hold her stomach.

In the clip, the star can be seen holding up a peace sign – or a number two – before making a heart shape with her hands.

While it's plausible to believe the singer was simply sharing a message of peace and love to her fans during the festive seasons, rumours of the hidden baby announcement have now taken Twitter by storm.

Meanwhile, other Bey fans are suspicious of the pregnancy news' timing.

Next week, Beyonce will attend the 59th Annual Grammy Awards – an occasion particularly close to the singer's heart given the fact she's amassed 53 nominations and 20 wins over the years.

Following the unprecedented success of her sixth studio album Lemonade, which has been nominated for staggering nine Grammy awards this year, some fans are thinking her well-timed pregnancy announcement to be a clever PR stunt to prevent the news detracting from her award-winning album and Grammy performance.

After all, when Beyonce opened her jacket to confirm her pregnancy following her rendition of Love On Top at the VMAs in 2011, it was this gesture – rather than the song – that naturally caught the world's attention.

It is, of course, reasonable to assume that one of the most famous women in the world might have put some thought into the perfect way to time her pregnancy announcement to the world.

But some of the theories that developed during her first pregnancy reached hilarious levels of fantasy.

Let's not forget that when Ms. Knowles-Carter announced her first pregnancy with the now-five-year-old Blue Ivy Carter, many people believed it to be fake, with talk of a shifting stomach during an appearance on an Australian television show and suspicion as to the lack of pregnancy photos before the birth.

This is the same woman who openly spoke out about the heartache of suffering a miscarriage before falling pregnancy with her first child, admitting the sound of her baby's heartbeat was 'the most beautiful music I ever heard in my life', during her HBO documentary Life Is But a Dream.

While it's unknown how far along the singer is in her second pregnancy, it's fairly traditional for a woman to keep the news hush hush until she's out of the first trimester.

Perhaps it is also worth considering that Beyonce and Jay Z might have been cautious in sharing the news of their family growing at a time when civil, reproductive and women's rights are currently under threat by the Trump administration in the US.

In all fairness to Beyoncé though, she's allowed to announce her news whenever she damn pleases really.

Just look at Adele and Eva Mendes, who kept their pregnancies quiet until the actual births, making a statement about the fact that, even though celebrities are in the public eye, they and their families are not public property.

Some conspiracy theories can be quite fun, admittedly, mostly when they are completely inconceivable or bizarre, but for now, let's focus on the fact Queen Bee is about to welcome two of the coolest kids to the planet.",0
2216,"""== Cohanim J2 - Eleazar - Phinchas - Zadok ==

 Agree. Dr. Karl Skorecki have the final word about Cohanim genetic signatures. He, more than anyone else, is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about Cohanim genetic signatures, not Jheald. He was the one who discovered the CMH in 1997. After 10 years, he came out to announce in 2007, that """"he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2"""". Katz, Kaplan, Rappaport, Shapiro, Kovacs,Konh, are all J2. Those surnames and families are the most prestigious Cohanim families today. They are all Cohanim J2. J2 Cohanim is much more common than J1 Cohanim. """"Skorecki reported that Pinchas the zealot mentioned in the Bible may be the origin of J2"""" This is a very important information that confirms matematical, historic, and genealogy facts. Phinchas was the son of Eleazar. Itamar was his brother. Out of the 24 Cohanim houses, 16 did belong to Eleazar-Pinchas, while only 8 came out from Itamar seed. Eleazar-Pinchas (J2) had a much larger population than Itamar. All Cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses, until the destruction of the second temple. So, if Phinchas is the origin of all Cohanim J2, than it makes sense, since his Cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother Itamar. So, it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two CMHs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of Cohanim. All genealogic tree for Cohanim since Aaron until today are still divided into these two houses: Eleazar-Pinchas and Itamar. During the 1270 years of the cohanim services (Mishkan and Mikdash) the Cohanim jews were always selected by the 24 houses. 18 from Pinchas, and only 8 from Itamar. That´s why J2 Cohanim is almost twice as common than J1 Cohanim"""" —Preceding unsigned comment added by 189.27.127.148

78.101.90.200  

Agree. Dr. Karl Skorecki of the Ramban/Technion Medical Center in Haifa, who is renowned for his discovery in 1997 of the Kohen genetic signature, reported in 2007 that he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2. """"Pinchas, the zealot mentioned in the Bible, may be the origin of J2"""" he suggested. 
The extended CMH-12 is established for J1 Cohanim only. If somebody in J1 also has CMH-12, then he is likely to have Cohen ancestry. J1 Cohanim form a tight network around CMH-12. But this is not the case for J2. The CMH-12 does not apply to J2. If a J2 is in CMH-12, it tells us nothing about one being a Cohen. In J2, the CMH-12 has no special status. The J1 lineage of Cohanim in CMH-12 could be much more recent.  Jewish Cohanim in J2 form a much larger network around CMH-6  than Jewish Cohanim in J1 do. Cohanim Jews belong mainly to haplogroup J2 because Cohanim as a group (J1,J2) have a high frequency of J2. The J2 Cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor, according to the *observed* mutation rate (which is three times faster than the standard, """"effective"""" rate). J2 Cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly Jewish caste (J1,J2). “The finding of J2 among contemporary Cohanim can lend credence that today’s Cohanim (J1,J2) may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to Phinchas as the founder of J2 Cohanim” concluded Dr. Karl Skorecki.

Why the confirmation that Phinchas may be the orign of J2 Cohanim is so important?

“Pinchas, son of Elazar, son of Aharon the Kohen turned back My anger from upon the Children of Yisrael, so I did not destroy the Children of Yisrael. Therefore say - behold, I give to him My covenant of peace” (Numbers 25:10 - 30:1). “God gave to Pinchas a new permanent priesthood, for him and his descendants for all generations.” (Zohar HaKadosh 3:124a). God indicated that Phinchas had acted justly by rewarding him with the most counter-intuitive form of blessing - an all-new form of priesthood. He is given the Divine Covenant of Peace and the gift of eternal priesthood. Zadok, a des",0

You used this non-sequitur as your basis for reversion.  And to this day you are persisting in it.  Yet again another example of a huge logic disconnect that permeates this entire exchange.

Alex, thank you for your reply.
I could indeed use a break from this case, but yesterday was a very eventful day, as the case closed and then AGK answered a question I'd initially posed on August 22, meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which I had a chance to respond to the FoF, and then when it made the response, it not only confirmed the """"judgment on content"""" aspect of the FoF, if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with Arzel in which Arzel not only ignores the content of academically published RS, he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the Formisano text, for example, had been under direct discussion.

Regarding the perceived legal threat, I had no intention to make a legal threat. That was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case, starting with NewYorkBrad's comment on my FoF on August 23, to which AGK refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday, more than two weeks later. There were also email exchanges between myself and NYB and AGK, which I will have to forward to Jimbo Wales at some point, after clarifying one point made by NYB on his talk page.

The import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as I make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that AGK aspires to become an attorney (or whatever they're called in Scotland). It is secondly an indication that I have taken the time to register at Wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments I had made about """"the court of public opinion"""". And when did a little looking around there, finding an entry about NYB, for example, who had advised AGK that he didn't see any misconduct in some of the points of the FoF, so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. 

If the reiteration of material deleted by AGK from his User page within the past two weeks is """"outing"""", then that is a policy I shall have to examine. Note that I am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.

There's much more to say on this, but I need to get a couple more hours of sleep. I have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at Jimbo's talk page, but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation, not even contrasting the complete lack of an FoF on Arzel, for instance, with the response provided to me on the PD talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.

If this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions, and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished, I would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system.  連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0

2174,"=The Signature of the Atomic Bomb
There are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of Japan, marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per 27 October 2010, or 19 Dhu al-Qidah 1431, or 19 Heshavan 5771. Butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. Except from this, it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. First. Art by artists working both before the World War II, during and after, can not necessarily be defined as more, or less, contemporary because of this timestamp. Contemporary art did explicitly exist also before World War II, as this label - contemporary - has been expressed as a mark of quality, pertaining especially to modernism, by art carrying an ideal summoning, from the artist or his genius, making some kind of composed expression of what, in such case, are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time, reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world, in the event of the art-making process including its publication or presentation. Another trickster is, for me, that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. It is absurd as a Norwegian to not consider Henrik Ibsen a maker of contemporary art. His plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. I sincerly believe that Henrik Ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed, or may I say be transported by the unfolding of time. The retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the 19th century. I think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies.",0

Drake abruptly cancelled his Amsterdam concert last night, and the official cause of the cancellation was ""illness."" In fact Drake's official spokesperson said, ""Drake wanted to perform tonight, but unfortunately he became ill and his doctor has told him he can't perform.""

But we're hearing something DIFFERENT. According to a snitch, Drake reportedly smoked some weed mixed with hash, and it was too strong for him. One person who is in the know claimed, ""He overdosed on weed. It wasn't anything dangerous . . . he just got too high.""

2627,"Kendall Jenner: Why She’s Quitting ‘KUWTK’ But Remains Proud Of Kylie’s Spin-off Show

Kendall Jenner continues to distance herself from the reality show platform that made her family a household name, with sources stressing that the model wants to have a legitimate career.

Kendall Jenner has found herself modeling for some of the biggest campaigns in fashion for the past two years, and as her brand continues to skyrocket, so are her annual earnings through endorsements, sponsorship deals, and modeling contracts.

Seeing how well things have been going with her career, Kendall Jenner sees no reason why she should remain on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. She’s grown tired of sharing her personal life on television, and now that she’s working harder than ever before, she doesn’t even have the time to shoot scenes for the show anymore.

From Kendall Jenner’s point of view, the 21-year-old wants to build a brand that’s mainly focused on her modeling career. Sources say that by being on reality TV, Kendall thinks it could potentially hinder her chances of being taken seriously in the fashion industry.

She’s worked extremely hard to distance herself from being known as nothing more than Kim Kardashian’s little sister, and while it’s paid off for her, for the most part, Kendall Jenner can’t stress enough that she needs to leave the world of reality television to truly be taken seriously by some of the biggest fashion designers in the world.

Sharing everything about her life, including who she’s dating, could potentially have an effect on the relationship she will go on to form with industry people. To eventually become as famous and successful as Naomi Campbell or Kate Moss, being on reality television is not going to cut it for her.

“Kendall will still make some appearances here and there in [KUWTK], and in Kylie’s new show, but only when she’s in town and around — she wants to limit her time on camera as much as possible,” an insider tells Hollywood Life.

For now, she has limited the amount of appearance she makes on KUWTK, along with her sister’s forthcoming reality show, Life of Kylie. But her overall intentions are to eventually stop making appearances entirely, saying that it’s no longer where her mind is at.

“Kendall’s modeling career is going really amazing, and she’s worked so hard to be taken seriously. She feels like she’s finally getting there and that she’s now being booked because she’s Kendall the model, not just one of the Kardashians. Kendall is grateful for the start in her career that the show gave her, it was a great springboard for her, but at the same time, it was a hiderence—and it’s not the thing that she wants to be known for in her life.”

Last month, the E! network confirmed that Kylie Jenner had landed her own spin-off titled Life of Kylie, Variety reports, which is expected to premiere in July.

The series will follow Kylie on her journey to branching out and building an empire that’s focused on beauty and cosmetics.

Kylie Cosmetics, her reputable company, is already said to make millions in profit each month, and while Kylie the businesswoman will often be seen on the show, Kendall’s little sister will also touch upon personal subjects such as her breakup with Tyga.

Anything that could potentially make Kendall Jenner look bad is something that she wants to stay away from, so if there’s any sort of drama or tension on Kylie’s show, Kendall is sure to keep her distance because she doesn’t want to be seen in that light.

Do you think it’s a wise move for Kendall Jenner to ditch KUWTK in favor of building a respected modeling career with longevity?

Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs rarely adhere to traditional rules of style, and when it was time for the pair to hit Cannes , they gave the red carpet a daring couples' moment. Wearing his-and-hers Dior at the premiere of Pattinson’s latest film, Good Time , they showed two sides of the storied French brand, with Pattinson, a face of the label, going classic in a dapper three-piece Dior Homme black suit and Twigs opting for audacity in a postcard print-covered dress.

Twigs’s colorful choice was actually plucked from the archives: John Galliano’s Spring 2002 “street chic” collection. The rebellious spirit of that season has experienced a revival of late, with fashion insiders unearthing their J’Adore Dior T-shirts and logo-covered bikinis. For her retro moment, Twigs skipped the layered runway styling and paired the gown with a simple ribbon choker and marabou-covered heels for a dainty contrast to Pattinson’s movie-star suiting. Separately, each would have been well dressed, but together they proved the versatility and enduring cool of one of fashion’s best-loved houses.

2719,"David Gest found dead at 62: Liza Minnelli's ex husband discovered after 'unexplained' death in London hotel

David Gest, the reality TV star and former husband of Liza Minnelli, has been found dead in a five-star London hotel in ""unexplained"" circumstances.

The 62-year-old music producer's body was discovered at the luxury Four Seasons hotel, in Canary Wharf, on Tuesday morning.

Scotland Yard said the death of the star - who was due to begin a UK tour of a musical called David Gest Is Not Dead, But Alive With Soul this summer - is ""unexplained"" and a post-mortem examination will be carried out.

Police were called to the hotel, in Westferry Circus, at about 10.15am.

Paramedics were called, but Gest was pronounced dead at the scene.

It is believed that Gest's death is not being treated as suspicious and detectives are understood not to have found any obvious causes at the scene.

The former Celebrity Big Brother star was married to Minnelli from 2002-2003, but they only officially divorced in 2007.

Gest was also known for being a close friend of the late Michael Jackson.

The TV personality was a familiar face on British TV, appearing in I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2006 and in Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year, which he exited after only 13 days due to ill health. He also appeared on ITV's Grease Is The Word.

Gest was due to tour the United Kingdom in a musical show called David Gest Is Not Dead, But Alive With Soul, starting in York on July 1.

The name was inspired by an incident in the Celebrity Big Brother House when American reality star Tiffany Pollard mistakenly believed Gest had died rather than David Bowie.
Friend Imad Handi said: ""It is with great sadness that I can confirm that David Gest has died today.

""David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon.

Mr Handi added: ""I know he will be missed by millions of fans around the world, and particularly in Britain, who came to love his charm and blistering one-liners.

""If I may steal the words of one eminent critic, David was a natural star and a genuine celebrity. I will miss him desperately.""
Gest married Minnelli in March 2002 in a star-studded ceremony with Michael Jackson as best man and Elizabeth Taylor as maid of honour.

Before filing for divorce, Gest sued Minnelli for assault, claiming that she had beaten him so badly during alcoholic rages that she caused him nerve damage and caused him to be treated in hospital for five days.

Minnelli also sued Gest, claiming her estranged husband had stolen at least $2 million she earned while performing in shows he produced.

The pair ended their dispute in 2007 when their lawyers filed court papers saying they had settled their differences and agreed to get divorced without fault

Gest grew up with Jackson and his brothers in California, and was close friends with the family.

He was a successful producer and in 2001 his television special on the 30th anniversary of the launch of Jackson's solo career was the highest rated in history.

In a recent interview with the BBC, ahead of one of his shows in Eastbourne, he spoke frankly about not wanting to be famous while he was married to Minnelli.

He said: ""There's a part of me that never wanted to be quote 'a celebrity' when I was married - I can't remember the woman's name.""

Prompted by the interviewer that it was Minnelli, he responded: ""I knew it was Elizabeth. I never wanted to be in the public eye. It's very hard when you wake up each day and there's press outside your house.

""I would never want to live that type of life, I live a very simple life.""

Earlier this year, Gest spoke to The Grimsby Telegraph about where he wanted to be buried.

He said: ""I will never go back to LA; I will die here and want to be buried in York. I love this country much more than my own.""

Celebrities' shock at death of 'loyal dear friend'

Writing on Twitter, Myleene Klass described Gest as ""wonderfully kind"" and ""extremely generous"":",0

In 1895 Albert Einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland. In 1896, after school in Switzerland, Einstein renounced his German citizenship. Carl P. Jung was born in in the Swiss canton (or county) of Thurgau. While Jung worked on Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), tensions grew between Freud and Jung. 

Frank P. Geyer continued to serve as a detective until August 15, 1903 when he resigned. He had been transferred to the 18th Police District in the United States. Detective Geyer had arrested James Anderson; whether this is the same Anderson mentioned in Detective Geyer's 1896 work is non-determinable. In 1912 tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. In 1901-02 Albert Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper, obtaining a teaching position at school in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. 

The FBI file on Einstein came to light in 1983 when Robert Alan Schwartz wrote an article on the subject for The Nation magazine. Between J. Edgar Hoover and John Hutchison, democratic rights didn’t stop with McCarthy’s downfall nor with the demise of so-called notorious J. Edgar Hoover. Yet for years, zero-point energy according to Hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. Hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. John Hutchison's claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are, like, NASA. The FBI should do an article on NASA and their non-determinable webers.

I do not find it too surprising Schwartz once more wrote about not only Frank Geyer, but Albert Einstein with not too much said about Carl P. Jung during these years around the turn of the centennial.",0

Edits by Keraunos

Hi, Keraunos. I see you added to, and rearranged, some of this article. I ameliorated some of your additions for accuracy. Below are listed my ameliorations of your edits and my reasons for them:

 You added the edit """"because the temperature of the cosmos rising toward infinity as the final singularity of the big crunch is approached will provide a potentially infinite amount of energy to power the cosmic supercomputer.""""

I take it that what you tried to explain here is the energy resource. But actually, that isn't physically accurate. The universal heat diverging to infinity doesn't provide usable energy. Where the usable energy comes from is the gravitational shear (i.e., the universe's Taublike collapses along different axes with each cycle, called Mixmaster oscillations), which provides a temperature differential across the universe whereby usable energy can be obtained. Hence, I went ahead and cut this edit of yours.

If people read further into the body of the article, under the section """"Outline of the physics of the Omega Point Theory,"""" some of this is already explained, with references provided for further research (with a number of the references available online for free).

 You added a bit into here: """"the Omega Point represents the resurrection of the dead followed by an infinite-duration afterlife as an avatar in cyberspace, which could take any imaginable form within the metaverse of the cosmic supercomputer due to its virtual nature.""""

I kept the ressurection link. I understand from reading your user page that you're into science fiction and transhumanism, but one should avoid loading up this article with needless science fiction terminology and transhumanist terminology, as well as computer terminology which isn't that accurate (such as """"avatar""""). The term preceding your edits, """"simulated reality,"""" already expresses the ideas you're getting at, and people can follow that hyperlinked text if they're not sure what that means.

 You added most of this: """"engulfed by artificially intelligent life as it approaches the point of maximum expansion, which, according to Tipler, will occur 'between 5 X 10^16 and 5 X 10^18 years from now (in proper time)'.""""

One should be more accurate in their terminology, as most people think of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as meaning intelligence via artifically created programs. Yet if uploaded human consciousnesses become a reality, then the programs of their minds would be natural, but on an artificial substrate. Hence, I'm changing this to """"From that point on, the entire visible universe would be engulfed by these 'mind children' as it approaches the point of maximum expansion,"""" with """"mind children"""" referring to the previously defined mention of the term.

I also removed your quote of Tipler's estimation as to when the universe will be engulfed, as that is from his 1994 book The Physics of Immortality, yet later cosmological observations have been able to define the Hubble shift more accurately, which is what that estimation is based on. So Tipler's current estimation is different now. For more on that, see:

F. J. Tipler, """"The structure of the world from pure numbers,"""" Reports on Progress in Physics, Vol. 68, No. 4 (April 2005), pp. 897-964. See also here. Also released as """"Feynman-Weinberg Quantum Gravity and the Extended Standard Model as a Theory of Everything,"""" arXiv:0704.3276, April 24, 2007.

 You added the section """"Criticism from string theory.""""

I kept pretty much all of this, while editing it slightly to improve the style and formatting. I changed the section title to """"Implications from string theory,"""" since Brian Greene doesn't actually offer any criticism of, or even refer to, Tipler's Omega Point Theory in Greene's book that you referenced.

This section, as it stands now, might have to go entirely, as it appears to fall under Wikipedia's rule concerning original research. As it's written, it's a valid deduction that the Omega Point singularity would be obviated if string theory disallows singularities and if string theory is true, but it's an original deduction.

 You moved the """"See also"""" section to underneath the references. You also added a number of links therein.

Based upon Wikipedia's """"Featured articles,"""" it appears that the preferred location of the """"See also"""" section is where it was previously, before the references. Hence, I moved it back. I removed the link """"metaverse,"""" because it's a science fiction term that's perfectly explainable with more acce",0

2783,"Jessica Simpson Flashes Her Butt for Eric Johnson's Birthday: Pic

Less is more! Jessica Simpson celebrated her husband Eric Johnson’s 38th birthday by sharing a racy tribute to Instagram on Sunday, September 17.

In the snap, the singer flashes her butt and black panties while the former NFL player stands in front of her while holding a pint of beer in each hand.

Reactions to the provocative post were mixed — with some users sharing their distaste.

“Girl, there’s a time and place for everything but… ‘Oh no Baby what is you doing?!’” commented one follower.

While another added: “Highly inappropriate. Should be behind closed doors.”

This is not the first time The Dukes of Hazzard actress has celebrated a birthday with a cheeky snap on Instagram. The songstress, who turned 37 in July, rang in her special day by sharing a revealing Instagram pic. In the photo, a topless Simpson lies flat across a green pool float while showing off her booty in a colorful bikini.

“Kiss My Butt 36,” she captioned the pic at the time.

Simpson and Johnson, who got engaged in 2010 after four years of dating, tied the knot in a private ceremony at San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara, California, in July 2014.

In May, the fashion designer opened to Extra about her husband, whom she calls her “guilty pleasure.”

“We do do dates, but it’s more like couch dates, make-out dates,” she revealed. “He always loves me and I don’t know how… Maybe because we got really amazing kids. He always just takes care of me.”

The happy couple, who are parents of Maxwell Drew, 5, and Ace, 4, celebrated their seven-year wedding anniversary in May by sharing a sweet black-and-white snap of the family.

“7 years, 2 kids, and a whole lotta love later,” she captioned the Instagram post.

And while the picture-perfect foursome have a lot of fun together, the couple isn’t rushing into having more children anytime soon. In an appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show in May, Simpson told the 59-year-old host: “We got an IUD, nothing is gonna get in that uterus,” she said jokingly. “I have two beautiful children and I’m not having a third, they’re too cute — you can’t top that.”

But the duo's third wedding anniversary on May 24 made them reconsider the split. Kim even posted a tribute to her hubby on Instagram, writing, ""3 down, a lifetime to go...,"" though friends weren't sure they'd make it. “They’re trying to make it work,” a different source shares, “but there are a lot of problems between them. It’s an ongoing struggle.”

For example, Kanye, who infamously threw out a good chunk of Kim's wardrobe when they first got together, ""feels like she isn’t worldly or interested in experiencing other cultures,” the source admits.


Adds the first insider, “They’re on different paths and don’t connect anymore."" And although Kanye accompanied her on a trip to Disneyland with their kids recently, the brunette beauty has had to essentially parent by herself during this time apart.

A third source told Life & Style earlier this month that the artist, who's allegedly in Wyoming working on a new album, is still struggling to find stability. ""He’s not back to himself since the hospitalization. He doesn’t want to put himself in a situation where he’s taking on too much.”

But it's interesting that the guard would choose to come forward with the details of his employments now, especially amidst some rumors of Pitt's shortcomings as a father.

According to Billingham, the couple's primary concern was their children. They wanted the guard to keep the six kids — Maddox, 15; Pax, 12; Zahara, 11; Shiloh, 10; and 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne — safe, particularly from kidnapping.

A former member of the British army, Billingham described the couple's intense protectiveness of their children. Pitt and Jolie didn't want the kids spending time or going anywhere with strangers. They were also worried about stalkers who could endanger the lives of their children, according to The Sun. But Billingham said he was was one member of their staff that the couple allowed to get close to the kids, according to the Sun:

Billingham said he became so close with the kids that he was an ""unofficial"" father. But he didn't throw any shade at Pitt, whose parenting style some questioned after Jolie filed for divorce. E! News reported that Pitt was under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Department of Children and Family Services as a result of allegations that the actor verbally and physically abused the children. The allegations have not been substantiated.

From what Billingham describes of his relationship to the couple and their children, it's clear that Pitt and Jolie want what's best for their children. In her divorce filing, Jolie did cite the well-being of the kids as a reason for the split. Pitt, in his response, also emphasized his commitment to the couple's children. Hopefully, with the right support system — perhaps including people like Billingham — the kids will get through the divorce alright.

Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms """"vandlism"""" are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here.

2824,"Kevin Hart and Wife Eniko Parrish Share Sweet Photos of Baby Kenzo

Kevin Hart and wife Eniko Parrish shared an adorable photo of their newborn, Kenzo Kash Hart, and the parents couldn’t help but gush!

“A love like no other! Every ounce of pain was worth it ALL,” Parrish, 33, captioned the sweet shot of her holding the baby on Saturday, November 25. “Would I do it again? ABSOLUTELY!”

The comedian, 38, also shared the same pic and wrote, “Sooooooo DOOOOOPPPPPEEEE…..I love how Roxy won’t their side!!!! #Harts #Happy #Blessed #DopePic Photo cred ME.” Hart referenced the couple’s dog, who can be seen in the shot lying at Parrish’s feet.

He later posted a pic showing him cradling his son. “Feeling beyond blessed on this beautiful sunday morning….Morning vibes with my little man. #Harts #BabyZo#LiveLoveLaugh ….Wifey gets the amazing Photocred,” he captioned the photo.

In another black-and-white photo, he posted a poem for his newborn: “You are a little miracle / Our beautiful baby boy. / We pray you’ll feel so safe and loved / Surrounded by our joy. / For we are blessed to hold you close / And feel your beating heart. / The little life we hoped for / How wonderful you are. / We raise our hearts with praise and thanks / For you our little gift. / May God’s peace surround you / As you wake and as you sleep. #Harts / And may you grow to live and love / And play your little part. / In this world may your light shine / And never be put out #Harts.”

While fans gushed over the new addition to their family, others praised the new mom for bouncing back to shape just days after delivering the baby. The model looked toned while wearing black shorts and a white crop-top, prompting an Instagram user to write, “Girl the snap back is real.”

One person wrote, “Ok!!! We see you with cute shape.. just had a baby where?” with a laughing emoji.

“Haters will say it’s photoshopped,” wrote another.

Hart announced the arrival of their son on Tuesday, November 21, with a tweet: “God is truly amazing….Kenzo Kash Hart was born at 1:45am. He is Healthy & already smiling. Thank you all for your prayers!!!! We love & appreciate ya #Harts.”

The Central Intelligence actor and Parrish announced via a Mother’s Day Instagram post that they were expecting their first bundle of joy together. The couple, who first met in 2009 and tied the knot in August 2016, weren’t shy about documenting the pregnancy on their social media accounts.

Hart was previously married to Torrei Hart from 2003 to 2011. The exes share daughter Heaven, 12, and son Hendrix, 10.

Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!

2598,"O.J. Simpson will agree to Khloe Kardashian paternity test if she visits him in prison, former guard says

O.J. Simpson would reportedly take a paternity test to see if Khloe Kardashian is his daughter, but there's one catch: The reality star would need to visit him in prison.

The former football star, a close friend of late lawyer Robert Kardashian, will consent to a mouth swab but wants the ""Kocktails with Khloe"" starlet to ""show him a little respect"" and stop by the Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada, according to the Daily Mail Online.

The website cites Jeffrey Felix, a former Lovelock prison guard who claims the facility has given permission for the test, as its source. Felix also penned a book about Simpson called ""Guarding the Juice.""

""He wants to talk to her about some other things too, but more importantly like her he wants to know if she is his daughter,"" Felix said.

In the new documentary ""The Man Who Saved O.J. Simpson,"" Felix claimed the 31-year-old Kardashian had begged Simpson to put the paternity question to rest with a test.

Kardashian is the third of four children born to Robert Kardashian, who died of esophageal cancer in 2003, and Kris Jenner, who divorced him in 1991.

The reality star set off ceaseless rumors after speculating on a 2009 episode of ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" that she might be adopted — and even swabbed her mom's mouth for a DNA test.

They continued to fend off gossip over Kardashian's paternity, particularly after Robert Kardashian's ex-wives Jan Ashley and Ellen Kardashian, who he married after divorcing Jenner, suggested in a 2012 Star Magazine story that she wasn't a member of the famous family.

Khloe Kardashian got first taste of racism during O.J. trial
""The audacity you have to mention my father's name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low,"" Kardashian, then married to Lamar Odom, tweeted at the time. ""YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).""

Jenner later chimed in during a ""Good Morning America"" interview, calling the theory ""crap"" and telling its promoters to ""get a life.""

""I was there, right. I gave birth, I know who the dad was. Everything’s good. We’re all good,"" the momager said.

The ex-NFL star was famously acquitted of the murder of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman in the 1995 ""Trial of the Century,"" during which Robert Kardashian served as a member of Simpson's legal dream team.

Jenner, who has admitted she wasn’t faithful to the trial lawyer during their marriage, was a close friend of Brown Simpson.

Why does the section """"5 Mainstream scholarly reception"""" end in a comment by Doherty, himself decidedly not a part of that mainstream, which basically says that someone else should come along. Isn't this akin to a proponent of a minority view saying that one day (oh happy day) the majority will come to see the wisdom of the minority view and change its mind. Revision and changing minds are an essential part of all branches of scholarship but why should we give a platform to any one view in this?  (smile back)

Well, in case anyone's interested in following up on this further, using the La Trobe University on-line search engine, a search for the term mahāpurisalakkhaṇ (truncated to allow for various inflections) leads to 77 (BJT) record hits, at least 65 of which are in the Pali Canon.  Here's the first page of the search results (with links to the subsequent pages as well):  http://www.chaf.lib.latrobe.edu.au/dcd/pitikaresults.php?title=&start;=60&to;=70&searchstring;=mahāpurisalakkhaṇ .  
Of course, this is by no means a straightforward indicator of how many discourses actually reference this term (nor what this term means in the context of various suttas) since multiple records can be part of a single sutta.  (Similarly, this is not a clear reflection of the total number of times that this term appears in the Pali literature as a single record could have multiple instances of the term and their might be other ways of formulating this phrase not addressed by the above truncated compound term, etc.).  
FWIW, a quick review of these results (potentially suggestive of the distribution of this term in the various nikayas) shows 40 hits in the Digha Nikaya, 15 in the Majjhima Nikaya, none in the Samyutta Nikaya, 3 in the Anguttara Nikaya, and 7 in the """"canonical"""" Khuddaka Nikaya (mostly in the Suttanipata), 5 in the paracanonical KN words (e.g., Netti, Peta), one in the Abhidhamma's Kathavatthu, once in the Visuddhimagga, and 5 times in the Pali histories.  If nothing else, this distribution perhaps suggests that suttas identified by Peter and myself might possibly be (among?) the core texts. -)

2798,"Kim Kardashian's Sweet Message About Serena Williams' 'Prince': 'He Makes Her So Happy'

From the beginning, Kim Kardashian West knew Serena Williams had found her prince in Alexis Ohanian.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 37, told Vogue that the couple were meant to be during cocktails after their wedding ceremony Thursday in New Orleans.

“I’ve known Serena for so long and am so happy she’s found her prince,” Kardashian West told the magazine. “From the moment she told me she met Alexis in Rome, it was like… she’s been so happy and has this light about her that is so special to see.”

The reality star continued, “You just know it is so real. He makes her so happy and that just makes her friends happy.”

The tennis champion and the Reddit co-founder married at the Contemporary Arts Center on Nov. 16, which was also the birthday of Ohanian’s late mother Anke who died nine years ago.

The ceremony came just 11 weeks after the couple welcomed their baby girl, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., on Sept. 1 — almost two years after they began dating in 2015.

A slew of celebrity guests were in attendance, including Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian, Eva Longoria and husband José Bastón, and fellow tennis star Caroline Wozniacki with her new fiancé, NBA player David Lee.

Guests dined on an around-the-world-themed dinner as the band played several of Serena’s favorite Disney songs, including “Be Our Guest.” The bride wanted a French ball–themed reception inspired by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve’s fairy tale, Beauty and the Beast, according to Vogue. Serena’s sister, Venus Williams, looked gorgeous in her custom Galia Lahav bridesmaid dress as she walked down the aisle. The couple also wrote their own vows, with Ohanian telling his wife, “I will always have bad jokes that make your eyes roll; make you give me the side eye. You are the greatest of all time, not just in sport. I’m talking about as a mother, and as a wife. I am so excited to write so many more chapters of our fairy tale together.” Their love story has been a real fairytale. In December, Williams announced their engagement on Reddit, describing the horse drawn carriage that awaited her.”I came home. A little late. Someone had a bag packed for me. And a carriage waited. Destination: Rome,” Williams wrote under her personal account. “To escort me to my very own ‘charming.’ Back to where our stars first collided. And now it was full circle. At the same table we first met by chance,” she wrote. “But by choice. Down on knee. He said 4 words. And I said yes.”

Well, yes, that's fine, but the point here is that there is no publisher's statement made about anything in that sentence. The idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference. If the resource says, """"Joe at worms"""" then we write """"Joe ate worms"""". About tarnishing any reputation, that isn't the point at all. And about accepted practices in the publishing world, this is Wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call """"policy and """"guidelines"""" since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus. About people keeping records of how many books were published, I think you missed the point there. Publisher's Weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books among other things for example. They are a secondary source. Do you see how that's different?  About the article on FIP, it hadn't any sources at all which is one of the reasons it was deleted.

If you were in communication with an admin, and were actively working on it, you (or the admin) should have actually put a valid hangon message on the talk page. Quite frankly, I don't believe the draft article you're working on is ready to go for the following reasons: 
There's a number of grammar and spelling errors

Bolding is for the first use of the subject in the lead paragraph only 
References shouldn't be generalized like you've put them. Individual facts in the article should be footnoted to the references (see WP:FN and WP:CITET if you don't know how to do this) 
The section on """"Search engine submission software"""" should be omitted entirely, as it's covered in a separate article. Don't duplicate material, that's what wiki links are for 
Move the reasons why its notable (media coverage, awards) to the 1st or 2nd paragraph

2737,"Robert Pattinson: 'Twilight's the hardest part I've done'

He made his name as teenage vampire heart-throb Edward Cullen in Twilight. Then his turbulent romance with co‑star Kristen Stewart dominated the world's gossip columns. Now Robert Pattinson is older, wiser and shedding his Hollywood pretty-boy image. He talks about his new role in David Michôd's dystopian outback western The Rover 

There is a moment in The Rover, David Michôd's futuristic western set in the Australian outback, in which Robert Pattinson's character sits in the cab of a truck at night listening to the radio play Keri Hilson's hit Pretty Girl Rock. The night is black and the radio tinny, and softly Pattinson begins to sing along. ""Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful,"" he sings, his voice high and whiny, the lyrics muffled by lips that cling to dirty teeth. ""Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful.""

It's a pivotal moment for Rey, the slow, needy, uncertain young man Pattinson plays, but it also feels like something of a reference point in the career of the actor himself; a small reminder for the audience of just how far he has run from his days as the pretty-boy Hollywood pin-up.

The Pattinson who walks into our interview this morning seems to play a similar trick, pointing out, two steps into the room, that the hotel carpet ""looks like a Magic Eye picture"". And indeed it does – a bold, blurry pattern in stripes of cream and black. But Pattinson's remark also serves to shifts attention neatly away from himself, as if he is weary of being the centre of it, the face that everyone stares at.

Pattinson was 22 when he was first cast as Edward Cullen in the Twilight Saga, the five-part movie adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's best-selling teen vampire novels. Overnight he became one of Hollywood's most adored young stars, pursued wherever he went by paparazzi and screaming fans. He was named ""the most handsome man in the world"" by Vanity Fair, and one of the 100 Most Influential People by Time. Amid all the fuss and the madness he embarked upon a tortuous relationship with his co-star, Kristen Stewart, that meant the young couple were rarely out of the gossip pages.

He is 28 now. The final Twilight instalment done, the Stewart romance finished, he is finally cutting a dash as a serious actor.

Early leading-man roles (Remember Me; Water for Elephants) have given way to more challenging characters – he earned impressive reviews for his portrayal of a young billionaire in David Cronenberg's adaptation of Don DeLillo's Cosmopolis, and will soon be seen in another Cronenberg project, Maps to the Stars – as well as starring alongside Nicole Kidman in the Gertrude Bell biopic Queen of the Desert.

But for now he is rooted in Michôd's The Rover, a brilliantly dark story of a loner (Guy Pearce) in pursuit of a gang of ramshackle crooks who have stolen his car. En route, he acquires Rey (Pattinson), the brother of one of the thieves, whom they had left for dead at the scene of a botched robbery, and together they chug through the Australian desert, now a glowering, lawless land 10 years after a global economic collapse.

""I just thought it was strikingly original,"" Pattinson says of first reading Michôd's script. ""Even in the way it looked on the page.

""David's got a very specific way of writing dialogue. It's very functional, the writing's very harsh, it's savage, but it didn't feel just stylised writing – it was emotional as well. It just seemed so natural compared to something like No Country for Old Men. I always felt that was more like film writing. And this didn't really feel like a film script – it felt like a dream.""

Pattinson has a very particular way of speaking: he will talk softly, intently about subjects you sense mean a great deal to him – Michôd's writing, for instance, or the craft of acting – only to then sweep it to one side with a flourishing ""It was crazy!"" or a burst of wheezy, slightly wild laughter. It gives the impression of someone who has not quite yet settled into his skin.

He had to audition for The Rover – a process he loathes. ""I'm quite good at doing meetings,"" he says. ""If I'm just meeting someone about a job I'm like a dog, especially if my agent's said to me: 'A lot of people want this job.' Then I'm like: 'Oh yeah? Then I will do anything to get it!'"" What's his technique? ""I don't know, I just become a bullshit artist!"" he laughs. ""That's when I start acting! I'm really much better at doing it when the cameras aren't rolling ...""

But auditions petrify him. He has spoken of the good 45 minutes of ""neuroses"" he has to suffer before any audition can ever really begin. ""I just can't ... I literally can't do it,"" he tries to explain. ""It's just me looking uncomfortable, trying to put on an American accent ... or sitting in the corner, making myself throw up and punching myself in the face."" What helps get him past the neuroses, what happens after those excruciating 45 minutes that helps him perform. ""Just that you think that someone actually believes you can do something,"" he says. ""That makes me sound like such an idiot. It's crazy.""

But the joys of acting still outweigh these moments.

""For whatever reason, I think there's something profoundly satisfying about being able to watch something you've done afterwards, or to just do a scene and feel like: 'Oh, I just had an out-of-body experience for a second!'""

He pauses. ""Just for one second,"" he says gently. ""And generally people don't even notice. It feels literally like you've been asleep for a second."" He recalls such a moment while shooting this film. ""It's not the biggest scene, it's not even in the movie, it was the rehearsal. And me and Guy had just been going so nuts – we'd been out in the desert and we'd become like crazy homeless people. And I turned around and looked at him and just realised actually, we're not acting any more."" He laughs. ""And why did that feel so good? It's so weird.""

It's easy to assume that being tethered to the long-running Twilight Saga held him back from experiencing such moments, from growing as an actor, but he argues that the role required more resources than most. ""I think Twilight's probably the hardest part I've done,"" he says, ""because to do it for five movies, it's really hard to think of stuff that's maybe not boring. Especially if you don't die. Because what's the drama? You're not scared of anything! And that's the whole essence of drama: life and death.""

Pattinson was born and raised in London, but many of his film roles have required an US accent. In The Rover, Rey is from the American South, and like many has relocated to Australia in search of work in the mines. It was the voice, he says, that led him into the character.

He recalls ""losing my mind"" during his first day on set. ""It just didn't feel right for ages,"" he says. ""And then there was this one little thing – I had this makeup on my teeth, and it kept rubbing off all the time. It was really putting me off – it meant I had to keep redoing scenes. So I started trying to do this thing where I covered my teeth with my lips. And it changes your voice a little bit, but I thought: 'Oh, that's really cool!' And after that I started speaking like that 'ouhhggghhh ...'"" he replicates the style, and then laughs. ""It's so silly, it's so stupid! I was just kind of making the accent up, I don't even know what state it is really.""

But for Pattinson, having the opportunity to play a grubby-toothed mumbler from an unidentified corner of the American South proved liberating, as did the fact that his character plays second fiddle to that of Pearce. ""There's something about Rey, and there's something about not having to drive the story forward,"" he explains. ""You can just be the condiment. It's really kind of freeing just being the sidekick weirdo.""

He is full of praise for Pearce, for his physicality and his ability to transform himself for the role. He speaks of how, for much of their time on set, he thought Pearce to be physically bigger, and of his strange surprise when filming ended to find him not only clean-shaven but also somehow reduced in stature.

""And I liked seeing that Guy, even after having done tons and tons of movies is still scared,"" he adds. ""I've worked with some actors who, having done so many movies, they just know what they're gonna do. No matter what I would be doing in a scene they would have practised their part in a mirror already and that was it, whereas Guy is really trying to find it still. So that was why it was more fun – because neither of us really knew what the movie was about when we started. But he's not afraid to let it happen. And there's very few actors who've been doing it as long as he has that still approach it like that, that still have that element of danger.""

How did they find out what the movie was about? ""I think it's about the feel,"" Pattinson says. ""I think after I did Cosmopolis I realised that trying to psychoanalyse parts and trying to be all clever about it ... well, it only really started with actors in the 50s, and for thousands of years before that it was just about voice and using your body as a performance instrument ..."" he gives a faintly embarrassed laugh. ""So I generally think whatever feels nice, it's probably right.""

What felt nice in this role was the language, he says. ""It was all the little speech patterns. It was like a song - if you're singing a song in a certain way you're not trying to make it sound sad or something, it just is."" He frowns. ""I keep trying to do that in movies, but it's really difficult trying to find scripts that allow for it, that mean you don't have to hit specific thematic beats.""

Occasionally he tries to write something himself. ""I was trying to write a play the other day and I showed it to my assistant and didn't quite realise how bad it was."" He laughs and laughs. ""I was writing it totally by myself in the middle of the night thinking: 'This is how you do it! You just stay up all night and keep writing!' She came in the next morning, and I'd been up all night writing. I said to her: 'You have to read this! It's amazing!'"" He could tell it was perhaps not, he says, from her facial expressions as she read. ""And then she said: 'It's not in English ... and half the time you haven't even put the character names in so it's just a stream of consciousness ...'""

But he would like to be in a play, he says. ""Something in a really small theatre. I don't think I could do something on Broadway ... But I'd quite like to do something kind of shocking.""

He likes being shocking, he says, and his next role is satisfyingly so. Starring alongside Robert De Niro in Olivier Assayas's Idol's Eye, he will play a small-time criminal caught up with the Chicago mafia. ""My character is this slightly delusional lost child,"" he says. ""Everyone always glamorises criminals – it feels inevitable in movies – but in this it's really not glamorised. It is quite dense. It's really serious. Very political.""

I think of something he told me earlier, about the ways in which he believes Twilight has influenced his career, and of how he wagers that most cinema audiences have judged him before he has uttered a single line on the screen. I pictured his frustration, the effort of forever trying to shake off that famous role, but on the contrary, he explained, he enjoys the possibilities that tension brings.

""It's kind of fun,"" he said. ""Because people have preconceived ideas about you, and sometimes it affords you the opportunity to shock people more.""

2539,"Jay-Z: 'Jesus Is Fake News; Lucifer Is Way Of Truth And Light'

“Jesus Christ is the original fake news,” according to Jay-Z, who claims “Jesus never walked the earth, y’all being played” and “the idea of Jesus is just a tool used by smart people to control dumb people.”

Going as far as to claim “Lucifer is the way of truth and light“, Jay-Z also credited his self-described “new humility and maturity” to “fully embracing my older bother, Lucifer.”

During an backstage rant at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans on Friday, Jay-Z also claimed Satanism has “gotten a bad rap” due to “mentally challenged Christians and their desire to be slaves,” but Satanism is actually “the highest form of being.”

“There is real spirituality and guidance in the Church of Satan that you just don’t get in Christianity, because Christianity is a fake religion, built by assholes,” Jay-Z said. “Hands up, how many Christians here have prayed to God for years and aint gotten nothing back, just silence and emptiness? Be honest. It’s OK.”

As the small crowd of ticket winners began to murmur nervously, Jay-Z announced, “I can answer for y’all because I am free. Because I recognized Jesus is the original fake news, designed to enslave humanity.“

“I’m telling you this because I know you guys look up to me and want to emulate me. I will give you this one guarantee, if you start following the doctrine of Lucifer, you will taste success. The secret of the universe opens up to you. It is immediate and glorious.”

The 99 Problems rapper also hinted at his Satanic beliefs onstage, telling audiences to ignore the rules of the venue and the security staff trying to enforce them. Instead of respecting the rules, Jay-Z instructed his audience to “Do what thou wilt“.

It has long been known that Jay-Z is a follower of Aleister Crowley, the English occultist and founder of the Satanic religion Thelema.

The religion is founded upon the idea that the 20th century marked the beginning of the Aeon of Horus, in which a new ethical code would be followed; “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law“. This statement indicates that adherents, who are known as Thelemites, should seek out and follow their own true path in life, known as their True Will.

Jay-Z’s Satanic preaching is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the rapper has shared with the dark side. After starting his career as an aspirational rapper, he reinvented his image as a dark lord, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as he rode to the top of the rap game.

Since establishing himself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, Jay-Z has attempted to tone down his dark image, however the disturbing conversation he held in New Orleans suggests he is far from a reformed character, and he has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society.

The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance.

2840,"Why Justin Timberlake Didn’t Go to the Emmys With Jessica Biel

Jessica Biel stunned at the 2017 Emmy Awards in L.A. on Sunday, September 17, without her usual award show date, husband Justin Timberlake, by her side — and it turns out that the actress, 35, was riding solo for a very good reason.

Timberlake, 40, touched down in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to perform at Rock in Rio’s show the same night. The singer headlined the event, which also featured performances from Alicia Keys, Walk the Moon and Frejat. Attendees at the annual concert series — which fundraises for social, environmental and cultural causes — also saw Maroon 5, Shawn Mendes, Fergie and more perform on previous nights.

Prior to the concert, Timberlake shared a series of behind-the-scenes photos with the caption: “We out here #RockInRio!”

Meanwhile, Biel’s night at the Emmys started on a rough note. On her way to the 69th annual ceremony, the actress revealed that the air conditioning in her car wasn’t working. She captioned an Instagram post, in which she appears to be struggling through the heat, “When the AC is broken en route to the Emmy’s you thank God for the ice in your drank. #emmys.”

While on the red carpet for the event, the actress — who stunned in a Ralph & Russo gown, Forevermark diamonds and Stuart Weitzman shoes — gushed over her and Timberlake’s 2-year-old son Silas’ latest milestones. “Now he’s saying to me, ‘No, no, mommy. We’re not going to do this anymore,’” Biel told E! News’ Guiliana Rancic. “And ‘this is not a match,’ which means he doesn’t want to do it anymore.”

1412,"Thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously.  To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.   Similarly, shouldn't we just describe the content of the movie (noting that it is controversial), and then if we want an article about the Bin Laden family departure or whatever we can put the facts about that subject there?   20:19, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)",0

2619,"Kourtney Kardashian Neglecting Her Children To Party In Cannes? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Is Kourtney Kardashian neglecting her children to party in Cannes? That’s what a lot of fans can’t help but wonder as Kris Jenner was spotted taking care of her children, Mason and Penelope Disick near her family home in Calabasas, California on Wednesday, May 24. Kris took her grandchildren to run errands with her while Kourtney was frolicking with her new boy toy Younes Bendjima.

Eyewitnesses say that Kris took Mason and Penelope along with Kim Kardashian’s daughter North West out for frozen yogurt. She’s babysitting her grandchildren while Kourtney and Scott are partying thousands of miles away in Cannes.

A lot of fans can’t help but wonder why Kourtney would still be in Cannes knowing that Scott is there with his new girlfriend Bella Thorne. Apparently, both parents are trying to compete with each other for paparazzi and media attention while their children are back at home.

Sure, Kourtney Kardashian loves her children and puts them first in her life – she’s proven it plenty of times in the past. But is her new romance with Younes Bendjima getting in the way of her parental responsibilities? That might be the case, especially since a lot of people are pointing out that both Kourtney and Scott are acting like children themselves.

Kourtney has spent the last week showing off her bikini body and making out with Younes in the South of France. Taking a page out of her book, Scott is now doing the same by partying with Bella. He was even spotted getting very up close and personal with her at their hotel pool in Cannes. Clearly, Scott is trying to make a point by cuddling and making out with the former Disney star in the same town as his ex and baby mama.

So far Kourtney has not made any comments about her new relationship with Younes Bendjima. But if there’s one thing for certain, it’s that she doesn’t plan on getting back with Scott Disick anytime soon.

That chapter is closed, done and in the past. Still, many critics can’t help but wonder if Kourtney might be flaunting her relationship with Younes to make Scott jealous. After all, Scott did it to her several times in the past.

Either way, it doesn’t look like Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick’s drama is going to end anytime soon. In the meantime, don’t forget to check back with CDL for all the latest news on Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick.

2447,"Tyga To Reveal The Ugly Truth About Kylie Jenner And Kardashians In New Tell-All Book, Insiders Say

Tyga and Kylie Jenner have made it to Splitsville, according to E! News, and it looks like things could get pretty ugly in the near future. Although the relationship is reportedly over, it doesn't look like the two have ended on amicable terms, and things are only beginning to heat up. According to Perez Hilton, Tyga is reportedly planning to release a tell-all book in the wake of his big break-up with Kylie. Insiders close to the ""Make It Nasty"" rapper have dropped a few details about the rumored upcoming book.

But how would the Keeping Up With the Kardashians matriarch, Kris Jenner, feel about Tyga releasing a shocking tell-all book about Kylie and the Kardashian family? In most cases, close friends of the Kardashian family are locked into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit them from speaking publicly about the family. But apparently, Tyga never signed any form of agreement which would allow him to speak publicly if he desires. A family insider recently shared details about the alleged book.

Although Tyga and Kylie Jenner initially tried desperately to conceal their relationship because of Kylie's age, it's no secret he's been in her life for quite some time. Because of that, he's also seen a lot, including how she's evolved over the years. It's quite obvious Kylie's had a number of cosmetic surgeries, but now Tyga reportedly plans to reveal just how many enhancements she's actually had. The insider even insists Tyga was there for many of the surgeries she had.

However, that's not all. The insider also claims Tyga has a staggering amount of incriminating details about Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for his tell-all book. Since Tyga and Kanye have collaborated on records, he's spent lots of time with the Yeezus rapper and his famous wife. But apparently, all of his interactions with the couple haven't been pleasant. In fact, the insider claims Tyga has enough dirt on the couple to write more than one book. For months now, several rumors have circulated about the famous couple's marital problems, but of course, the rumors have not been confirmed.

Reports about Tyga's tell-all book come shortly after their epic break-up on the rapper's 26th birthday. According to People magazine, Kylie Jenner is absolutely furious about her ex-boyfriend's alleged cheating. An insider close to the 18-year-old reality star recently shared details about her reaction to the heart-wrenching breakup.

Although the Kardashian women have a history of on-again, off-again relationships, it looks like this may definitely be the end for Tyga and Kylie Jenner.

Do you think Tyga and Kylie Jenner are completely done? If Tyga released a tell-all book, would you read it? Share your thoughts.

This is the main disputed claim (commented enough in other articles), unacceptable for me and several other Ukrainian and Belarusian users
Regardless of any """"Ukrainian military"""" table, none of them may include the Red Army. This army was not only irrelevant to any of Ukrainian states (with very formal post-WWII exception), but also significantly anti-Ukrainian.

2808,"Taylor Swift's 'Reputation': All the gossip about Joe Alwyn, Kanye West and Tom Hiddleston

In the preface of her two Reputation-themed magazines, which feature photos, poetry and hand-written lyrics to celebrate the release of her sixth album, Swift lamented the inevitable news stories that guess at the targets of her lyrics.

“When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test,” she wrote. “There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it’s 2017 and if you didn’t see a picture of it, it couldn’t have happened right?”

Yet, even with its controversy-winking title, Reputation is probably the least-gossipy release of Swift’s career. Instead of an array of songs potentially referencing different ex-lovers, the majority of Reputation is dedicated to a single subject, whom Swift is still (as far as fans know) happily dating.

The allusions to Swift’s past dramas are few and far between, and when they do show up on Reputation, they make for some of the album’s very best songs. Swift steers clear of Katy Perry and squad drama and bashing her exes, keeping her apologies short, and list of enemies shorter.

More: Taylor Swift, pop princess, wins song of the year at the CMA Awards

Swift is a master at chronicling her soured relationships, with many of her finest songs memorializing (and sometimes flaming) her exes. So what happens when Swift writes an album about a person she’s still into? That’s the story of Reputation, and the British actor Joe Alwyn, whom Swift has been spotted with over the past year, is the man at its center.

“Oh, 25 years old / Oh, how were you to know,” Swift sings on Dancing With Our Hands Tied, referencing Alwyn’s age at the time she wrote the album (he's 26 now). The “ocean blue eyes” Swift sings about on Gorgeous almost certainly belong to Alwyn, a motif that repeats on Dancing With Our Hands Tied (“Deep blue, but you painted me golden”) and Delicate (“Oh damn, never seen that color blue”). Swift also mentions his British roots in Gorgeous when she sings, “You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk,” calling herself his “American queen” on King Of My Heart and teasing, “Do the girls back home touch you like I do?” on Delicate.

And beyond songs like Gorgeous and Delicate that deliberately reference Alwyn, Swift spends the majority of Reputation lusting after, falling in love with and eventually pledging her loyalty to her new beau, the most time she’s ever spent on a romantic upswing on one of her albums.

Taylor Swift and Kanye West (and her squad)

Swift came out of the gate swinging on Reputation's lead single Look What You Made Me Do, with lyrics like ""I don’t like your little games / Don’t like your tilted stage"" that seemed directed at West, the rapper who reignited their feud when he unceremoniously included Swift's name in his Famous lyrics.

With an album title like Reputation, fans speculated whether the entire album would be a vindictive screed aimed at Swift's enemies. Turns out, Look What You Made Me Do was a red herring, and West barely makes an appearance in the album's lyrics, save for one other song in which Swift laughing at the rapper as she dances on his grave.

The album's third-to-last track, This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things, is a postmortem of Swift's 1989 era, when she partied with her squad members on Instagram and was buddy-buddy with West, before 2016 arrived and Swift's public persona took a hit.

""It was so nice throwing big parties / Jump into the pool from the balcony,"" Swift begins, remembering ""feeling so Gatsby for that whole year"" before she gets to the chorus, singing with a smirk in her voice, ""This is why we can’t have nice things, darling / Because you break them.""

Then, it's West's turn. ""It was so nice being friends again / There I was giving you a second chance / But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand,"" she sings, referencing their fateful phone call about Famous that West's camp recorded and later posted to smear her as duplicitous.

""But I’m not the only friend you’ve lost lately / If only you weren’t so shady,"" she continues, raising a toast to her real friends, her mother, and then eventually to West. ""And here’s to you, 'cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do,"" she says, before breaking down in giggles, saying, ""I can’t even say it with a straight face!""

This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things may be an enjoyable slice of pettiness, but the album's crown jewel of gossip is Getaway Car, which sees Swift in full storyteller mode as she chronicles using one doomed relationship to escape another.

With lyrics like “I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason” and ""With three of us, honey, it’s a sideshow,"" the song seems to reference the several months in 2016 when Swift parted ways with Calvin Harris and dated Tom Hiddleston immediately after, before eventually splitting with him too. To follow the song's metaphor, Hiddleston is the getaway car driver who whisks Swift away from another man (""Well he was running after us / I was screaming ‘Go go go!'"").

In the end, she leaves him too, escaping with the fortune and singing, ""I put the money in a bag and stole the keys / That was the last time you ever saw me.""

Swift may not want fans to linger on the gossip behind her songs, but when it's as wonderfully told as Getaway Car, honestly, who can blame them?

2716,"Paul McCartney Is Not Dead (And Neither Is the Past)

This January marks the tenth anniversary of the Beatles' appearance on the American charts. Last month Rolling Stone conducted its first full-scale interview with Paul McCartney, in six sessions starting in a London recording studio and ending on a New York street. The New York sessions took place the day after McCartney had entered the US for the first time in two years, visa problems stemming from two marijuana violations now finally resolved.

McCartney was cautious in his responses during the first two sessions. He and Linda remembered being on vacation in Scotland when they were first shown John Lennon's lengthy interview (Rolling Stone Number 74 and Number 75, January 21st and February 4th, 1971), and having been deeply hurt by it. At first he seemed to want to avoid the kind of controversy Lennon's interview had generated but in later conversations he became freer with his answers.

Because the various sessions were necessarily disconnected, our text does not follow in all cases the actual sequence of questions. For example, McCartney's discussion of his legal difficulties is compiled from three separate conversations. One of those discussions was prompted by an incident on a New York street. We were walking down 54th Street towards the New York office of Eastman and Eastman, attorneys – Lee and John Eastman, father and brother of Linda McCartney (whose photographs illustrate this interview).

A man in a gray suit with a colorful umbrella approached McCartney and asked, ""Mr. McCartney? This is for you."" It was an American copy of a process from Allen Klein that had been served on Paul two weeks before in London. An outraged PR man howled; McCartney smiled and told the man, ""Thank you very much."" He was being sarcastic.

The villain of the scenario, so far as he was concerned, was not the man in the gray suit, but Klein himself, whom McCartney calls a ""punk."" McCartney claims he sued his fellow ex-Beatles in High Court because it was the only way to sue Klein. When we queried the head of ABKCO Industries about the suit, he seemed to relish the new confrontation. ""He now has the opportunity to say anything he wants in court,"" Klein told us. ""He has his opportunity to fight me face to face. I am welcoming it. Now he's in the same ring with me. Isn't that what he wanted?""

John Eastman made this statement concerning the Beatles/Apple/Klein suits and Paul's involvement in them:

""John Lennon, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, Apple and others started an action in England against ABKCO and Klein. This complaint alleges ABKCO and Klein took excessive commissions, practiced fraud, suggested conduct which would have been a fraud on the tax authorities in the US and UK, mismanaged Bangla Desh and otherwise mismanaged the affairs of the complainant. This action is now pending against ABKCO and Klein.

""ABKCO then sued Lennon, Harrison, Starr, Yoko Ono, Apple and other related companies in the US. It claims damages against them of $63,461,372.87 plus future earnings.

""ABKCO also joined Paul, claiming conspiracy. Its only claim against Paul is that Paul conspired with Yoko Ono, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr as well as Bag Production and other corporations wantonly, maliciously, fraudulently, wrongfully and intentionally without justification in law or fact to damage or injure plaintiff (ABKCO).' Damages are sought for this alleged conspiracy of $34 million plus interest.""

Our interviews were delayed some months, first by a Wings tour and later by a series of recording sessions in Nigeria. Even after that wait, the McCartneys seemed surprised at how much we wanted to know. In the end they were interviewed in a London recording studio, Paul's Soho office, Lee Eastman's offices and apartment in New York (where baby Stella McCartney wore the interviewer's watch on her foot) and the studio of cover photographer Francesco Scavullo. As the interview begins, Paul is telling how he wrote one of the songs he recorded in Nigeria.

– P.G.

We were in Jamaica on holiday and we were staying in a little house outside Montego Bay, and we read in the local newspaper, The Daily Gleaner, that Dustin Hoffman and Steve McQueen were in town filming Papillon. They were just along the coast from us. We were saying it would be great to meet him, have dinner with him, so Linda rang up. She's good at that, I'm always a bit embarrassed.

We got friendly and were chatting away. We'd been talking about songwriting, and Dustin was saying he thought it was an incredible gift to be able to write a song about something. People think that, but I always maintain it's the same as any gift. It probably is more magical because it's music, and I think it is more magical. But take his acting talent. It's great. I was saying, ""It's the same as you and acting, when the man says 'Action!' you just pull it out of the bag, don't you? You don't know where it comes from, you just do it! How do you get all of your characterizations? It's just in you.

So he says, ""You mean you can just do it, like that?"" He was lovely, Dustin. [Does Dustin Hoffman impersonation.] ""You can just do it?"" We went back a couple of days later and he said, ""I've been thinking about this, I've seen a little thing in Time magazine about Picasso, and it struck me as being very poetic. I think this would be really great set to music."" It was one of those Passed On bits, you know, Transition or whatever they call it. ... [Sees unusually dressed studio assistant.] ... Transvestite. ... So he says there's a little story here. In the article he supposedly said, ""Drink to me, drink to my health, you know I can't drink any more."" He went to paint a bit, and then he went to bed at three in the morning. He didn't wake up the next morning and they found him, dead.

I happened to have my guitar with me, I'd brought it around, and I said, yeah, sure. I strummed a couple of chords I knew I couldn't go wrong on and started singing ""Drink to me, drink to my health,"" and he leaps out of his chair and says, ""Annie! Annie!"" That's his wife. He says, ""Annie! Annie! The most incredible thing! He's doing it! He's writing it! It's coming out!"" He's leaping up and down, just like in the films, you know. And I'm knocked out because he's so appreciative. I was writing the tune there and he was well-chuffed.

Then we went to Nigeria and we were working in Ginger's studio – Ginger Baker/ARC Studio in Lagos, nice studio down there. We thought we'd do this Picasso number, and we started off doing it straight. Then we thought, Picasso was kind of far out in his pictures, he'd done all these different kinds of things, fragmented, Cubism and the whole bit. I thought it would be nice to get a track a bit like that, put it through different moods, cut it up, edit it, mess around with it – like he used to do with his pictures. You see the old films of him painting, he paints it once and if he doesn't like it he paints it again, right on top of it, and by about 25 times he's got his picture. So we tried to use this kind of idea, I don't know much about it to tell you the truth, but what we did know we tried to get in the song, sort of a Cubist thing.


Then there was the trouble in Nigeria with Fela Ransome Kuti [Ex-Ginger Baker's Air Force].
You heard about that? All it was was we were recording in Lagos. Lately we've gone to two different places to record, just for the fun of it. We've been to Lagos and to Paris and in both of the places they say, ""Why did you come here? You've got much better studios in England or America, you must be daft!"" And we say, ""Well, it's just for the fun, it's just to come somewhere different for a different type of turn-on, that's all."" They never really seem to be able to understand it. I think old Fela, when he found us in Lagos, thought, ""Hello, why have they come to Lagos?"" And the only reason he could think of was that we must be stealing black music, black African music, the Lagos sound, we'd come down there to pick it up. So I said, ""Do us a favor, we do OK as it is, we're not pinching your music.""

They felt that they have their own little ethnic thing going and these big foreigners are taking all their bit and beating them back to the West with it. Because they have a lot of difficulty getting their sound heard in the West. There's not an awful lot of demand, except for things like, what was it, ""Soul Makossa."" Except for that kind of thing they don't really get heard.

And they are brilliant, it's incredible music down there. I think it will come to the fore. And I thought my visit would, if anything, help them, because it would draw attention to Lagos and people would say, ""Oh, by the way, what's the music down there like?"" and I'd say it was unbelievable. It is unbelievable. When I heard Fela Ransome Kuti the first time, it made me cry, it was that good.

You've just had some musicians leave, haven't you?
Our drummer [Denny Seiwell] didn't want to come to Africa. I don't know quite why. He was a bit nervous about coming to Africa. We're all going to Africa to record and if the drummer won't come, what do you do? You don't say, ""Well, we'll see you when we get back, thanks a lot we understand."" You say, ""Well, er, ummm,"" and he leaves.

I think [guitarist] Henry McCulloch came to a head one day when I was asking him to play something he didn't really fancy playing. We all got a bit choked about it, and he rang up later and said he was leaving. I said, ""Well, OK."" That's how that happened. You know, with the kind of music we play, a guitarist has got to be a bit adaptable. It was just one of those things. I don't think there was anything wrong with them as musicians, they were both good musicians, but they just didn't fit in.

In the film 'A Hard Day's Night,' there were the stereotypes – if you remember John the thinker, Ringo the loner, and Paul the happy-go-lucky. Did you object to that?
No, I didn't mind it. No, no; I still don't. I was in a film. I don't care what they picture me as. So far as I'm concerned I'm just doing a job in a film. If the film calls for me to be a cheerful chap, well, great; I'll be a cheerful chap.

It does seem to have fallen in my role to be kind of a bit more that than others. I was always known in the Beatle thing as being the one who would kind of sit the press down and say, ""Hello, how are you? Do you want a drink?"" and make them comfortable. I guess that's me. My family loop was like that. So I kind of used to do that, plus a little more polished than I might normally have done, but you're aware you're talking to the press. ... You want a good article, don't you, so you don't want to go sluggin' the guys off.

But I'm not ashamed of anything I've been, you know. I kind of like the idea of doing something and if it turns out in a few years to look a bit sloppy I'd say, ""Oh well, sloppy. So what?"" I think most people dig it. You get people livin' out in Queens or say Red Creek, Minnesota, and they're all wiped out themselves ... you know, ordinary people. Once you get into the kind of critical bit, people analyzing you and then you start to look at yourself and start to analyze yourself, and you think, oh Christ, you got me, and things start to rebound on ya, why didn't I put on a kind of smart image ... you know, why wasn't I kind of tougher? I'm not really tough. I'm not really lovable, either, but I don't mind falling in the middle. My dad's advice: moderation, son. Every father in the world tells you moderation. [Linda laughs hysterically in the background.]

British parents aren't different ...
No, they're exactly the same. My dad could be the perfect American stereotype father. He's a good lad, though; I like him, you know.

I tell you what. I think that a lot of people worried about that kind of stuff didn't often have very good family scenes, and something happened in their family to make them bitter. OK, in the normal day-to-day life a lot of polished talk goes on ... you don't love everyone you meet, but you try and get on with people, you know, you don't try and put 'em up-tight; most people don't anyway.

So to me that's always been the way. I mean, there's nothin' wrong with that; why should I go around slugging people? I really didn't like all that John did. But I'm sure that he doesn't now.

Have you talked to him about that?
No, but I know John and I know that most of it was just something to tell the newspapers. He was in that mood then and he wanted all that to be said. I think, now, whilst he probably doesn't regret it, he didn't mean every single syllable of it. I mean, he came out with all stuff like I'm like Engelbert Humperdinck. I know he doesn't really think that. In the press, they really wanted me to come out and slam John back and I used to get pissed at the guys coming up to me and saying, ""This is the latest thing John said and what's your answer."" And I'd say, ""Well, don't really have much of an answer. He's got a right to say ..."" – you know, really limp things, I'd answer. But I believe keep cool and that sort of thing and it passes over. I don't believe if someone kind of punches you over you have to go kind of thumping him back to prove you're a man and that kind of thing. I think, actually, you do win that way in the end, you know.

What was your reaction when you read that stuff at the time?
Oh, I hated it. You can imagine, I sat down and pored over every little paragraph, every little sentence. ""Does he really think that of me?"" I thought. And at the time, I thought, ""It's me. I am. That's just what I'm like. He's captured me so well; I'm a turd, you know."" I sat down and really thought, I'm just nothin'. But then, well, kind of people who dug me like Linda said, ""Now you know that's not true, you're joking. He's got a grudge, man; the guy's trying to polish you off."" Gradually I started to think, great, that's not true. I'm not really like Engelbert; I don't just write ballads. And that kept me kind of hanging on; but at the time, I tell you, it hurt me. Whew. Deep.

Could you write a song or songs with John again?
I could. It's totally fresh ground, right now, 'cause I just got my visa, too. About two or three days ago; and until then, I couldn't physically write a song with John; he was in America. He couldn't get out. I couldn't get in. But now that's changed so whole new possibilities are opening up. Anything could happen. I like to write with John. I like to write with anyone who's good.

Right now you yourself are working on The Mouse Gang.
No, it's not the Mouse Gang, it's a show that will be called the Bruce McMouse Show.

I was thinking of The Zoo Gang.
The Zoo Gang, that's right, that's just a theme tune for a television show I was asked to do. Bruce McMouse is another thing. We filmed the last couple of dates at the end of Wings' first European tour. Bruce lives under the stage, you see. [Bruce and his family are animated and their exploits are spliced in between Wings' footage for a television film.]

Are you constantly deluged with this type of offer?
Not deluged. I get quite a few, you know. I just try and choose the ones I like the sound of. It's not anything I plan out. I remember a thing in Rolling Stone – there's a little bit of chat, I read the papers, you know – that said ""McCartney's going to do Live and Let Die, so it's come to that, has it?"" I thought, you silly sods. Because we were talking to another paper and when I said I was going to do Live and Let Die, the 007 thing, the reporter said, ""Hey, man, that's real hip."" So it just depends which way you look at it.

""Give Ireland Back to the Irish"" was the first of your singles in eight years that didn't sell in America and Britain.
Before I did that, I always used to think, God, John's crackers, doing all these political songs. I understand he really feels deeply, you know. So do I. I hate all that Nixon bit, all that Ireland bit, and oppression anywhere. I think our mob do, our generation do hate that and wish it could be changed, but up until the actual time when the paratroopers went in and killed a few people, a bit like Kent State, the moment when it is actually there on the doorstep, I always used to think it's still cool to not say anything about it, because it's not going to sell anyway and no one's gonna be interested.

So I tried it, it was Number One in Ireland and, funnily enough, it was Number One in Spain, of all places. I don't think Franco could have understood.

[At this point Paul receives word that a playback of Bruce McMouse is beginning in the control room. He excuses himself and we chat with Linda while Denny Laine plays a medley of Tim Hardin songs on the studio piano.]

Did you feel scared when McCartney was released, since that was your debut and the first song was pegged at you?
No. I didn't take it as seriously as I probably should have. I think it was good copy at the time to slag everything. Everybody was getting slagged, the Beatles were getting slagged. I personally didn't realize you had to explain yourself a lot once you get into the public eye. I just carried on with my normal life, like I had in New York, and I just got all this slagging. It never really brought me down much, though.

Do you think any Mrs. McCartney in that situation would have been slagged?
I think in what was going down then, yes. There was so much trouble for everybody, not done by one particular person, that everybody was getting blamed. I still can't look at it from the angle that I'm Mrs. McCartney. You know what I mean? I still see me as the person I've always been, either you like me or you don't. Paul likes me. [Laughter.]

And stood up for you during the slagging.
He was living with me, he knows I'm a good chick, he knows I don't have any bad motives. I'm not a grabber, I'm not any of that. He wouldn't have married me if I had been. So he stuck by me.

I just read totally bizarre stuff about myself. People would do an article on me and then an article on Yoko from childhood on up. I couldn't believe it. It was total fantasy. I mean, none of that happened, folks.

Unlike John, who went to a solo career, Paul went to a group.
John didn't really go to a solo career, there was the Plastic Ono Band and that. But Paul is very much a teamwork person. He doesn't like working just on his own. He still gets nervous. He likes working with people, bouncing off people and having them bounce off him. He likes helping people.


Have you ever entertained the thought of doing a record by yourself?
Not Linda McCartney's Great Single, no. I fool around with the songs I write, but I don't take it as a serious career.

You do have the novelty single coming up?
Yes. I did a song, ""Seaside Woman,"" right after we'd been to Jamaica, about three or four years ago, I guess. Very reggae-inspired. That's when ATV was suing us saying I was incapable of writing, so Paul said, ""Get out and write a song."" And then about a week ago we went in to do a B side for it of something I'd written in Africa, some chords I wrote in Africa, and we just talk over it. It's very sort of Fifties R&B, the Doves, the Penguins. I love that, that was my era. I'm New York, you know, Alan Freed and the whole bit.

We're going to put the single out under the name Suzi and the Red Stripes. When we were in Jamaica, there had been a fantastic reggae version of ""Suzi Q,"" so they used to call me Suzi. And the beer in Jamaica is called Red Stripe, so that makes it Suzi and the Red Stripes. It'll be out someday, but I've been saying ""Seaside Woman"" will be released since 1971 and we still haven't bothered. It's a bit like my photography book. Someday there will be a book.

Was it strictly through you that your father became associated with Paul as his lawyer?
It's through me, actually. I remember saying to my father, when I'd met Paul a few times but wasn't living with him, after Brian died, that he had helped a lot of people out of messes, could he help? He said well, I don't know. I said it would be great because I know you could help them out. So then I introduced Paul to my dad, and they got along instantly. If he hadn't met my father, Klein would have just hawked right in there.

[At this point we retire to the control room. Linda goes over the Walt Disney Christmas show script, then talks on the phone to someone at EMI. ""I think the only bit we'd like to add is a little bit from 101 Dalmatians ...""

[Paul talks to the engineer of Dark Side of the Moon. They marvel at its sales record, and the engineer notes that Pink Floyd are going to give him a Christmas present. ""Ask for a percentage,"" McCartney recommends. ""It's the best present they could give you. What that album has done so far is amazing. In France, it's outsold Abbey Road ...""]

How did you meet Linda?
Linda and I met in a club in London called the Bag of Nails, which was right about the time that the club scene was going strong in London. She was down there with some friends. I think she was down there with Chas Chandler and some other people, and I was down there with some friends, including a guy who used to work at the office. I was in my little booth and she was in her little booth and we were giving each other the eye you know. Georgie Fame was playing that night and we were both right into Georgie Fame.

When did you first realize you wanted to marry her?
About a year later. We both thought it a bit crazy at the time, and we also thought it would be a gas. Linda was a bit dubious, because she had been married before and wasn't too set on settling. In a way, she thought it tends to blow things, marrying ruins it. But we both fancied each other enough to do it. And now we're glad we did it, you know. It's great. I love it.

Some of the critical notices on her debut performances seemed to ask where she had come from.
Yeah. Well, the answer is, nowhere, really.

Mick Jagger had that quote. He wouldn't let...
... his old lady in the band, yeah. That was all very understandable at the time because she did kind of appear out of nowhere. To most people, she was just some chick. I just figure she was the main help for me on the albums around that time. She was there every day, helping on harmonies and all of that stuff.

It's like you write millions of love songs and finally when you're in love you'd kind of like to write one for the person you're in love with. So I think all this business about getting Linda in the billing was just a way of saying, ""Listen, I don't care what you think, this is what I think. I'm putting her right up there with me.""

Later we thought it might have been cooler not to introduce her so bluntly. Perhaps a little more show business: ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to my better half. Isn't she sweet and coy?""

It turns out it didn't matter, it didn't matter one bit. At the time it was a little rough, maybe. At the time it was rough for her. None of us realized what ... it was like someone marrying Mick, you don't realize ... you know there's going to be a lot of fans who are going to hate it, but you still end up thinking, well, it's my life. I know of a lot of rock & roll stars or just even show business people who will regulate their life to their image. It can mess you up a lot. I know a lot of guys from the old days who wouldn't get married, even if they wanted to. Wouldn't get married because it might affect their careers. The old management thing – ""You can't get married, all your fans are going to desert you."" So the guy doesn't get married.

But the thing is, in a couple of years, his career is over anyway. And he didn't get married, and he went and blew it. So I didn't. ""Well, I'm not going to let that kind of thing interfere with me."" Although I didn't wish to blow my career, I thought it was more important to get on with living. We went ahead and just did what we felt like doing. Some of it came out possibly a bit offensive to some people, but it turns out that it didn't matter in the first place. You just keep going.

Did your friends in music stick by you at that time or did you find it a little tough? Or did you have that many friends at the time?
I remember Ringo saying at the time ""How many friends have I got?"" and he couldn't count them on one hand. And that's what it boils down to, really. You can have millions of friends, but when someone asks you how many friends you've got, it depends on how honestly you're going to answer. Because I don't think I have that many. No one went against me or anything, I think I isolated myself a bit. It's just one of those things. We had just met for the first time. We're very romantic, the both of us, and we didn't really want to hang out with anyone else.

Do you often go back to Liverpool?
We visit to keep in touch with the Liverpool scene. My family roots are up there, our kids love, it, and my brother still lives there. In fact, we're going to make an album with him in January.

Will it come out as a Mike McGear album?
That's right. It's a singing thing, he's quit comedy for the moment. We're going to do it at Strawberry Studios in Stockport. We'll play it by ear, it's Mike's album.

Is it difficult for the kids, being your daughters?
I don't think so, I don't think they're going to be crazed-out kids. But it is funny sometimes. I remember I was sitting in a field and Heather was leading Mary and a little baby on a pony, and Mary just said to me, ""You're Paul McCartney, aren't you?"" When she's talking to me normally, she'll just call me Daddy. When there's company around, she knows I'm Paul McCartney, in inverted commas.

It's nice that we have all girls. If we had a son it might be harder on him, like Frank Sinatra, Jr. Everyone assumes he'll turn out to be his dad. At the moment, there's not much to worry about with the kids.

At your Oxford press conference you mentioned your four-year-old daughter liked the Osmonds. Linda says your ten-year-old daughter is a bit off them now ...
Yes, she is a bit...

...but I understand you met the Osmonds in Paris, which is a very unusual situation. It must have been as much of a thrill for them to meet you as it would be for a four-year-old to meet them.
A layer cake of generations.

As we're talking today three of the Top Six here [England] are by them, which is the greatest chart domination by a group since 1964.
They're very liked here by a lot of the record buyers, which in Britain are the young kids.

From your personal experience, do you think they can understand how much they mean to people?
Sure they know, sure. I think Little Jimmy probably knows less than the others what's going on, but they seem to. They've got that kind of American showbiz family feeling, which does work. You can put it down, but it really does work. They've been doing it for years on The Andy Williams Show, and they're troupers already. You know, the kid's only eight or something, Little Jimmy, but he's already a little trouper. He has what a seasoned performer has.

When you were in their position, did you feel a sense of responsibility, or did you feel the world had gone crazy?
No, no. We were a band who'd been trying to make it big for a long time. When you're trying to get to the top, when you start to get there, that's probably the biggest thrill. You don't think the whole world's gone crazy; you think it's great that they like you and you're well-chuffed that you're going down so well. That's all that enters your head. I think that even Little Jimmy just thinks, ""Hey, man, that's great, that's far-out."" You know? He just loves it. And that's really the best way.

When you get thinking too heavily about all of this stuff, like anything, you can do so many doublethinks on it all you end up with is not liking it, which is the only hang up. When you end up not liking it then you start to do it less well. I always thought, just great, great band, great things, kids screaming, fantastic, fabulous, great, everyone's having a good night out. That sort of thing, basically.


Were you frightened of possible negative reaction when you released your solo album, McCartney? It was your first break from the Beatles.
I was as confident as I ever am about any LP. I realize it was more kind of throwaway and done at home than any of the previous ones, but that wasn't a reason to worry about it. You never know what people are going to think about a record anyway.

The handout on the British edition of McCartney didn't appear in America. Why was that?
Linda and I did a mail-out from our house. We had made up this little interview for friends and the press and sent them out with about the first hundred albums. Somebody thought it was supposed to be a thing that came with the album, probably because we didn't explain it in the mailing. We should have said. ""Enclosed find press kit."" People got the idea it came with the album, but it didn't come out in Britain in the copies in the stores.

I had asked Peter Brown [of Apple] for a list of questions he thought might have interesting answers. Looking back, it seems a bit blunt and weird, but at the time it wasn't meant to be. Things like, ""Are you gonna be another John and Yoko?"" ""No, we're gonna be a Paul and Linda."" Little silly things like that.

How did you feel people would react to Linda's presence?
She was on Let It Be doing backup vocals. That was her first appearance, and nobody said much about that. The time we did McCartney, as it was largely recorded in the back room, she was always there. That was how she came to be on the album as much as she was.

You did have the release date close to Let It Be.
There was some hassle at the time. We were arguing over who had mentioned a release date first. It was all a bit petty. I'd pegged a release date and then Let It Be was scheduled near it. I saw it as victimization, but now I'm sure it wasn't.

Seeing that Let It Be was released basically after the fact, do you wish it had not been released?
Oh, no. I don't wish that about anything. Everything seems to take its place in history after it's happened and it's fine to let it stay there.

It was the first album to have the little bits on, like the type that also appeared on McCartney.
I rather fancied having just the plain tapes and nothing done to them at all. We had thought of doing something looser before, but the albums always turned out to be well-produced. That was the idea of the whole album. All the normal things that you record that are great and have all this atmosphere but aren't brilliant recordings or production jobs normally are left out and wind up on, say, Pete Townshend's cutting floor. It ends up with the rest of his demos.

But all that stuff is often stuff I love. It's got the door opening, the banging of the tape recorder, a couple of people giggling in the background. When you've got friends around, those are the kind of tracks you play them. You don't play them the big finished produced version.

Like ""Hey Jude,"" I think I've got that tape somewhere, where I'm going on and on with all these funny words. I remember I played it to John and Yoko and I was saying, ""these words won't be on the finished version."" Some of the words were ""the movement you need is on your shoulder,"" and John was saying, ""It's great! 'The movement you need is on your shoulder.' "" I'm saying, ""It's crazy, it doesn't make any sense at all."" He's saying, ""Sure it does, it's great."" I'm always saying that, by the way, that's me, I'm always never sure if it's good enough. That's me, you know.

So when McCartney came along I had all these rough things and I liked them all and thought, well, they're rough, but they've got that certain kind of thing about them, so we'll leave it and just put it out. It's not an album which was really sweated over, and yet now I find it's a lot of people's favorite. They think it's great to hear the kids screaming and the door opening, it's lovely.

The first of your albums with some of those little bitsy things was 'Let It Be.' Had you wanted to do that before?
Yes, I think so. In the back of everyone's mind there was always that kind of thing. The sound of a tape being spooled back is an interesting sound. If you're working in a recording studio, you hear it all the time and get used to it. You don't think anything of it. But when the man switches on the tape machine in the middle of a track and you hear that kind of djeeoww, and then – the track starts, I'd always liked all that, all those rough edges and loose ends. It gives it a kind of live excitement.

When you do have rough edges on an album, you're open to interpretation. There's the famous example of John and Yoko's 'Wedding Album,' where the reviewer reviewed the tone on the test pressing and said that the subtle fluctuations in this tone were very arty.
The whole analysis business is a funny business, it's almost like creating history before it's been created. When a thing happens you immediately start analyzing it as if it was 50 years ago, as if it was King Henry VIII who said it. It is daft, actually, but you can't blame anyone for doing it, they've got to write something. Unless they can say ""I was around at his house and he gave me a nice cup of tea ... funny little blue cups he gave it in ..."" they've got to say, well, what did you mean by this, or what was that tone.

With one song you mentioned just a few minutes ago, ""Hey Jude,"" everyone was trying to figure out who Jude was.
I happened to be driving out to see Cynthia Lennon. I think it was just after John and she had broken up, and I was quite mates with Julian [their son]. He's a nice kid, Julian. And I was going out in me car just vaguely singing this song, and it was like ""Hey Jules."" I don't know why, ""Hey Jules."" It was just this thing, you know, ""Don't make it bad/ Take a sad song ..."" And then I just thought a better name was Jude. A bit more country & western for me.

Once you get analyzing something and looking into it, things do begin to appear and things do begin to tie in. Because everything ties in, and what you get depends on your approach to it. You look at everything with a black attitude and it's all black.

This other idea of Paul Is Dead. That was on for a while. I had just turned up at a photo session and it was at the time when Linda and I were just beginning to knock around with each other steadily. It was a hot day in London, a really nice hot day, and I think I wore sandals. I only had to walk around the corner to the crossing because I lived pretty nearby. I had me sandals on and for the photo session I thought I'll take my sandals off.

Linda: No, you were barefoot.

Paul: Oh, I was barefoot. Yeah, that's it. You know, so what? Barefoot, nice warm day, I didn't feel like wearing shoes. So I went around to the photo session and showed me bare feet. Of course when that comes out and people start looking at it they say, ""Why has he got no shoes on? He's never done that before."" OK, you've never seen me do it before, but, in actual fact, it's just me with my shoes off. Turns out to be some old Mafia sign of death or something.

Then the this-little-bit-if-you-play-it-backwards stuff. As I say, nine times out of ten it's really nothing. Take the end of Sgt. Pepper, that backward thing, ""We'll fuck you like Supermen."" Some fans came around to my door giggling. I said, ""Hello, what do you want?"" They said, ""Is it true, that bit at the end? Is it true? It says 'We'll fuck you like Supermen.'"" I said, ""No, you're kidding. I haven't heard it, but I'll play it."" It was just some piece of conversation that was recorded and turned backwards. But I went inside after I'd seen them and played it studiously, turned it backwards with my thumb against the motor, turned the motor off and did it backwards. And there it was, sure as anything, plain as anything. ""We'll fuck you like Supermen."" I thought, Jesus, what can you do?

And then there was ""I buried Paul.""
That wasn't ""I buried Paul"" at all, that was John saying ""cranberry sauce."" It was the end of ""Strawberry Fields."" That's John's humor. John would say something totally out of synch, like ""cranberry sauce."" If you don't realize that John's apt to say ""cranberry sauce"" when he feels like it, then you start to hear a funny little word there, and you think ""Aha!""

When you were alive and presumed dead, what did you think?
Someone from the office rang me up and said, ""Look, Paul, you're dead."" And I said, ""Oh, I don't agree with that."" And they said, ""Look, what are you going to do about it? It's a big thing breaking in America. You're dead."" And so I said leave it, just let them say it. It'll probably be the best publicity we've ever had and I won't have to do a thing except stay alive. So I managed to stay alive through it.

A couple of people came up and said, ""Can I photograph you to prove you're not dead?"" Coincidentally, around about that time, I was playing down a lot of the old Beatle image and getting a bit more to what I felt was me, letting me beard grow and not being so hung up on keeping fresh and clean. I looked different, more laid back, and so I had people coming up saying ""You're not him!"" And I was beginning to think, ""I am, you know, but I know what you mean. I don't look like him, but believe me.""

You were supposedly Billy Shears, according to one of the theories.
Ringo's Billy Shears. Definitely. That was just in the production of Sgt. Pepper. It just happened to turn out that we dreamed up Billy Shears. It was a rhyme for ""years"" ... ""band you've known for all these years ... and here he is, the one and only Billy Shears."" We thought, that's a great little name, it's an Eleanor-Rigby-type name, a nice atmospheric name, and it was leading into Ringo's track. So as far as we were concerned it was purely and simply a device to get the next song in.


Your two big television shows were the James Paul McCartney and The Magical Mystery Tour shows. How were these conceived?
The Mystery show was conceived way back in Los Angeles. On the plane. You know they give you those big menus and I had a pen and everything and started drawing on this menu and I had this idea. In England they have these things called Mystery tours. And you go on them and you pay so much and you don't know where you're going. So the idea was to have this little thing advertised in the shop windows somewhere called Magical Mystery Tours. Someone goes in and buys a ticket and rather than just being the kind of normal publicity hype of magical ... well, it never is magical, really ... the idea of the show was that it was actually a magical run – a real magical trip.

I did a few little sketches myself and everyone else thought up a couple of little things. John thought of a little thing and George thought of a scene and we just kind of built it up. Then we hired a coach and picked actors out of an actor's directory and we just got them all along with the coach and we said, ""OK, act."" An off-the-cuff kind of thing.

The James Paul McCartney show were these people who wanted us to do a TV show and they said they wanted a nice show and said you can do it any way you want. This seemed like a good opportunity, you know, to kinda get on the telly. So that one was just worked up that way. We met the guy when we went to Morocco. We were on holiday then and they came out and we sat around the pool and talked about various ideas and came back to England and did it.

Were you sorry The Magical Mystery Tour was not shown in America?
At the time, hey, I thought, ""Oh, blimey,"" but ... eh ... it started out to be one of those kind of things. Like The Wild One, you know, Marlon Brando ... at the time it couldn't be released. The interest in it came later. The interest started to grow, you know. Magical Mystery Show was a bit like that ... well, whatever happened to it ... that's a bit magical itself. Like the Stones' Rock and Roll Circus. You know, what happened to that, you know. I mean, I'd like to see that. So all of those things work out well. You've got to be patient. Everything like that works out well. I think it was a good show. It will have its day, you know.

There was an interesting reaction to James Paul McCartney. Some people liked some parts and didn't like others.
I can understand that. You know, I think a lot of people thought we could have done more ... could have done a better show. It was a little bitty [disjointed]. That was a fair comment, but I got a lot of letters from people, you know, just people, old people, from like Red Creek, Minnesota, just saying, ""Hey man, dug the show, you know.""

You told me you still ask your friends, ""Is this really good?"" And Linda mentioned that you still get nervous about the work. And so does this mean you watch critical notices very closely?
No, I don't like criticism whatever. I don't think I ever liked it when my dad said, I don't like your trousers. But I went through a difficult period where I started to listen to what the newspapers have to say ... about me ... and say, some guy would be sittin' in New York all hung up thinking, ""Well, that's not as good as I woulda wanted."" And I thought, ""Well, blimey, that's only one guy. I'm not going to take it as gospel.""

Linda mentioned you ""bounce off"" people. After you left George Martin and the other three, was Linda the only person to bounce your ideas off of?
For a while, yes. Oh yes.

Did you miss not having more people? Is there anyone you ask now outside of people in the band?
Sometimes now I mainly bounce off myself. I do that more now, call it what you will – maturity? Sometimes if a friend is in the studio I'll ask for their opinion and that will make it easier on me. The laugh of all this is I say all this rubbish and it all changes the next day.

I still read the notices and stuff and they're usually bum ones when you're expecting them to be great. Like after Ram, there were a lot of bum notices after Ram. But I keep meetin' people wherever I go, like I met someone skiing. As he skiied past me he said, ""I loved Ram, Paul."" So that's really what I go by. Just the kind of people who flash by me in life. Just ordinary people and they said they loved it. That's why I go a lot by sales, not just for the commercial thing. Like if a thing sells well, it means a lot of people bought it and liked it.

Does that mean, then, that you didn't think too much in retrospect of 'Wild Life'? Because of all your albums ...
No, ah, I quite liked it. I must say you have to like me to like the record. I mean, if it's just taken cold, I think it wasn't that brilliant as a recording. We did it in about two weeks, the whole thing. And it had been done on that kind of a buzz we'd been hearing about how Dylan had come in and done everything in one take. I think in fact often we never gave the engineer a chance to even set up a balance. There's a couple of real big songs on there, that only freaks or connoisseurs know.

Well, ""Tomorrow.""
Yeah, ""Tomorrow"" is one of them. It's like, when I'm talking to people about Picasso or something and they say, well, his blue period was his only one that was any good. But for me, if the guy does some great things then even his downer moments are interesting. His lesser moments, rather, because they make up the final picture. Some moments seem less, he was going through kind of a pressure period. You know, you can't live your life without pressure periods. No one I know has.

You mentioned Dylan sort of being an inspiration for doing 'Wild Life' the way you did it ... He's going on the road, of course, this month.
With the Band ...

Does this in any way motivate you, inspire you?
No, not particularly. I mean, I've just been on the road last year, so my being ... doing that just might have inspired him; I don't know, you know. He's a great guy, Dylan; he's a musician, and stuff, and he's a great spirit. Love him, you know.

Do you think he influenced you at all?
Oh, yes. Very heavily.

I think the first time was in ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away."" That was John's song. Then there was a good deal of influence in the Hard Day's Night and Help! periods. Certain chords, the acoustic bit. We liked him.

We met him when we came to New York and we were together awhile. He came to one of my sessions when I was doing Ram in New York.

You mentioned in the studio that you were influenced in a recent session by Marvin Gaye's ""Trouble Man."" Do you think Fela or someone else might misconstrue this?
Being influenced by something and stealing something are two different things. When you hear the track we did and hear Marvin Gaye's you probably would never know they were related. I may be influenced by something, but it's in my head and doesn't necessarily show in the song. ""Here, There and Everywhere"" was supposed to be a Beach Boys song, but you wouldn't have known.

""Hi Hi Hi"" was the one that brought you back to the Top Ten, after ""Give Ireland Back to the Irish"" and ""Mary Had a Little Lamb,"" although in Britain they played ""C Moon"" because ""Hi Hi Hi"" was banned by the BBC.
I thought the ""Hi Hi Hi"" thing could easily be taken as a natural high, could be taken as booze high and everything. It doesn't have to be drugs, you know, so I'd kind of get away with it. Well, the first thing they saw was drugs, so I didn't get away with that, and then I just had some line ""Lie on the bed and get ready for my polygon.""

The daft thing about all of that was our publishing company, Northern Songs, owned by Lew Grade, got the lyrics wrong and sent them round to the radio station and it said, ""Get ready for my body gun,"" which is far more suggestive than anything I put. ""Get ready for my polygon,"" watch out baby, I mean it was suggestive, but abstract suggestive, which I thought I'd get away with. Bloody company goes round and makes it much more specific by putting ""body gun."" Better words, almost.

It made it anyway in the States.
Yeah, well, the great laugh is when we go live, it makes a great announcement. You can say ""This one was banned!"" and everyone goes ""Hooray!"" The audience love it, you know. ""This next one was banned,"" and then you get raving, because everyone likes to. Everyone's a bit anti-all-that-banning, all that censorship. Our crew, our generation, really doesn't dig that stuff, as I'm sure you know.

""Helen Wheels"" has done better in America than England, as have many of your records past, back to the old days. Have you ever thought of a reason why?
The only thing I can think of is the foreigner syndrome. We're British, and that means something to an American. It's like some Americans who do better over here, like Cassidy and the Osmonds, even Elvis.

It's been suggested that the Beatles provided something for Americans they had lost with the death of Kennedy – youth, happiness, freedom from inhibitions. Does that make much sense to you?
No, none at all.

In songwriting technique, how did you compose with John? How did you compose yourself and then with Linda?
Well, first, I started off on my own. Very early on I met John, and we then, gradually, started to write stuff together. Which didn't mean we wrote everything together. We'd kind of write 80% together and the other 20% for me were things like ""Yesterday"" and for John things like ""Strawberry Fields"" that he'd mainly write on his own. And I did certain stuff on my own. So I've done stuff on my own.

When I said how do you compose, I meant actually sitting down and doing it. Did you use guitar, or did you use piano?
When I first started writing songs I started using a guitar. The first one I ever wrote was one called ""My Little Girl"" which is a funny little song, a nice little song, a corny little song based on three chords – G, G7 and C. A little later we had a piano and I used to bang around on that. I wrote ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" when I was about 16. I wrote the tune for that and I was vaguely thinking then it might come in handy in a musical comedy or something. I didn't know what kind of career I was going to take.

So I wrote that on piano and from there it's really been a mixture of the both. I just do either, now. Sometimes I've got a guitar in my hands; sometimes I'm sittin' at a piano. It depends whatever instrument I'm at – I'll compose on it, you know.

Do you start with a title or a line, or what?
Oh, different ways. Every time it's different. ""All My Loving"" – an old Beatle song, remember that one, folks? – I wrote that one like a bit of poetry, and then I put a song to it later. Something like ""Yesterday,"" I did the tune first and wrote words to that later. I called that ""Scrambled Egg"" for a long time. I didn't have any words to it. [Paul sings the melody with the words ""scrambled egg ... da da da da ... scrambled egg ...""] So then I got words to that; so I say, every time is different, really. I like to keep it that way, too; I don't get any set formula. So that each time, I'm pullin' it out of the air.

When did you get the idea you were going to bring in a string quartet on ""Scrambled Egg""?
First of all, I was just playing it through for everyone – saying, how do you like this song? I played it just me on acoustic, and sang it. And the rest of the Beatles said, ""That's it. Love it."" So George Martin and I got together and sort of cooked up this idea. I wanted just a small string arrangement. And he said, ""Well, how about your actual string quartet?"" I said great, it sounds great. We sat down at a piano and cooked that one up.

How would you see George Martin's contributions in those songs in those days?
George's contribution was quite a big one, actually. The first time he really ever showed that he could see beyond what we were offering him was ""Please Please Me."" It was originally conceived as a Roy Orbison-type thing, you know. George Martin said, ""Well, we'll put the tempo up."" He lifted the tempo and we all thought that was much better and that was a big hit. George was in there quite heavily from the beginning.

The time we got offended, I'll tell you, was one of the reviews, I think about Sgt. Pepper – one of the reviews said, ""This is George Martin's finest album."" We got shook; I mean, ""We don't mind him helping us, it's great, it's a great help, but it's not his album, folks, you know."" And there got to be a little bitterness over that. A bit help, but Christ, if he's goin' to get all the credit ... for the whole album ... [Paul plays with his children.]


The Wings tour in 1972 was the first time you had toured in six years, wasn't it?
Yes.

Had you intended to keep it that long?
Oh, no, no, no. With the Beatles we did a big American tour, and. I think the feeling, mainly from George and John, was, ""Oh, this is getting a little bit uhhh ..."" But I thought, ""No, you can't give up live playing, we'd be crazy to."" But then we did a concert tour I really hated and I came off stormy and saying, ""Bloody hell, I really agree with you now.""

Where was that?
In America, somewhere, I can't remember exactly. It was raining and we were playing under some sort of big canopy and everybody felt they were going to get electric shocks and stuff. We were driven off in a big truck afterwards and I remember sitting in the back of the truck saying, bloody hell, they're right, this is stupid.

So we knew we were going to give up playing but we didn't want to go make some big announcement, that we were giving it all up or anything, so we just kind of cooled it and didn't go out. When anyone asked we'd say, ""Oh, we'll be going out again,"" but we really didn't think we would. So we recorded a lot and stuff and nobody felt the need to go out and play.

After six years I just thought it would be good to get out, because live shows are a lot of what it's about. If nothing else, you get out there and see what people want. I remember at the end of the Beatles thinking that it would be good if I just went out with some country & western group. To have a sing every day surely must improve my voice a bit.

When you did start to play live again, were you very nervous?
Yes. Very nervous. The main thing I didn't want to face was the torment of five rows of press people with little pads all looking and saying, ""Oh, well, he's not as good as he was."" So we decided to go out on that university tour, which made me less nervous because it was less of a big deal. We went out on that tour and by the end of that I felt quite ready for something else, and we went to Europe. I was pretty scared on the Europe tour. That was a bit more of a big deal, here he is, ladies and gentlemen, sold all the tickets out ... I had to go on with a band I really didn't know much. We decided not to do any Beatle material, which was a killer, of course, because it meant we had to do an hour of other material, and we didn't have it, then. I didn't have something like ""My Love"" that was sort of mine. I felt like everyone wanted Beatles stuff, so I was pretty nervous on that.

But by the end of the Europe tour I felt better, and at the end of the British tour I felt good. By the time we did the British tour I knew we could get it easily and that I could get it going. Everyone digs it, and there's enough stuff not to be nervous.

On the Wings tour the one song you did from the past was ""Long Tall Sally.""
The first time I ever sang on a stage I did ""Long Tall Sally."" I must have been pretty young, probably 14; I feel like I might have been 11, I don't know. We went to stay with our parents at a holiday camp called Butlins, a branch in Wales. They used to have these talent shows, and one of my cousins-in-law was one of the red coats who had something to do with the entertainment. He called us up on the stage, I had my guitar with me. Looking back on it, it must have been a put-up job, I don't know what I was doing there with my guitar. I probably asked him to get me up or something. I went up with my brother Mike, who had just recovered from breaking his arm and looked all pale. He had his arm in a big sling. We used to do an Everly Brothers number, something like ""Bye Bye Love."" I think it might have been ""Bye Bye Love,"" in fact. We did that, and then I finished with ""Long Tall Sally.""

Ever since I heard Little Richard's version, I started imitating him. It was just straight imitation, really, which has gradually become my version of it as much as Richard's. I started doing it in one of the classrooms at school, it was just one of the imitations I could do well. I could do Fats Domino, I could do Elvis, I could do a few people. [Smiles.] I still can! ""I'm walking, yes indeed, I'm ..."" [Does Fats Domino impersonation.] ""Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen."" [An Elvis impersonation.] That's Elvis.

Did many of those black artists appeal to you in the late Fifties and early Sixties? John did several Motown songs.
Yes, very much. I loved all that stuff. Those were my favorites, definitely.

When did you first think you wanted to be in a band?
I didn't think I wanted to be in one; I wanted to do something in music and my dad gave me a trumpet, for my birthday. I went through trying to learn that. But my mouth used to get too sore. You know, you have to go through a period of gettin' your lip hard. I suddenly realized I wouldn't be able to sing if I played trumpet. So I figured guitar would be better. It was about the time that guitar was beginning to be the instrument. So I went and swapped my trumpet for a guitar and I got that home and couldn't figure out what was wrong and I suddenly decided to turn the strings around and that made a difference and I realized I was left-handed. I started from there, really; that was my first kind of thing, and then once you had a guitar you were then kind of eligible for bands and stuff. But I never thought of myself being in a band.

One day I went with this friend of mine. His name was Ivan [Vaughn]. And I went up to Woolton, in Liverpool, and there was a village fete on, and John and his friends were playing for the thing. My friend Ivan knew John, who was a neighbor of his. And we met there and John was onstage singing ""Come little darlin', come and go with me...""

The Del Vikings' ""Come Go With Me""?
But he never knew the words because he didn't know the record, so he made up his own words, like ""down, down, down, down, to the penitentiary."" I remember I was impressed. I thought, wow, he's good. That's a good band there. So backstage, back in the church hall later, I was singing a couple of songs I'd known.

I used to know all the words to ""Twenty Flight Rock"" and a few others and it was pretty much in those days to know the words to that. John didn't know the words to many songs. So I was valuable. I wrote up a few words and showed him how to play ""Twenty Flight Rock"" and another one, I think. He played all this stuff and I remember thinking he smelled a bit drunk. Quite a nice chap, but he was still a bit drunk. Anyway, that was my first introduction, and I sang a couple of old things.

I liked their band, and then one of their friends who was in the band, a guy called Pete Shotton who was a friend of John's, saw me cycling up in Woolton one day and said, ""Hey, they said they'd quite like to have you in the band, if you'd like to join."" I said, ""Oh, yeah, it'd be great."" We then met up somewhere and I was in the band.

I was originally on guitar. The first thing we had was at a Conservative Club somewhere in Broadway, which is an area of Liverpool, as well as New York. There was a Conservative Club there and I had a big solo, a guitar boogie. I had this big solo and it came to my bit and I blew it. I blew it. Sticky fingers, you know. I couldn't play at all and I got terribly embarrassed. So I goofed that one terribly, so from then on I was on rhythm guitar. Blown out on lead!

We went to Hamburg, and I had a real cheap guitar, an electric guitar. It finally blew up on me, it finally fell apart in Hamburg. It just wasn't used to being used like that. Then I was on piano for a little while. So I went from bass to lead guitar to rhythm guitar to piano. I used to do a few numbers like Ray Charles' ""Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying"" and a couple of Jerry Lee Lewis' like ""High School Confidential.""

Then Stuart [Sutcliffe] left the group. He was the bass player. He lent me his bass, and I played bass for a few weeks. I used to play it upside down. And he used to have piano strings on it, because you couldn't get bass strings. They were a bit rare, you know, and they cost a lot, too, about ¢2 for one string. So he would cut these big lengths of piano strings from the piano and wind them on this guitar. So I played that upside down for a while. I'm pretty versatile, I'll give that to myself. I wasn't very good, but I was versatile.

I'm in Hamburg, and I have a little bit of money together, and finally saved enough money to buy myself a Hoffman violin bass. It was my bass, then, that was the one. And I became known for that bass, a lot of kids got them. That was my big pride and joy, because it sounded great.

And that was it, basically. The rest you know.

In America, the anthology album [Beatles 1967-70] and Red Rose Speedway were back to back Number Ones. You were replacing yourself. Did that strike you as odd?
I thought it was good, rather than odd, because obviously the big hang up after the Beatles broke up was, and really still is, can any of them be as good as the unit? The answer in most people's minds, I think, is ""No. They can't."" Because the unit was so good.

Were you glad those anthology albums were released for the historical record or to combat the bootleggers?
The bootlegging thing was one of the reasons. I didn't take an awful lot of interest in them, actually. I still haven't heard them. I know what's on them because I've heard it all before, you know. I haven't really taken much interest in Beatles stuff of late just because there has been this hangover of Apple and Klein. The whole scene has gone so bloody sick. The four ex-Beatles are totally up to here with it. Everyone wants it solved so everyone can get on with being a bit peaceful with each other.

There was a lawsuit recently, the three others against Klein.
Of course I loved that. My God, I hope they win that one. That's great. You see, apart from everything that went down, all the little personal conflicts, the reason why I felt I had to do what I had to do, which ended up specifically as being I had to sue the other three, was that there was no way I could sue Klein on his own, which is what I wanted to do. It took me months to get over the fact. I kept saying, I can't sue the other three, just because it's very hard news to go suing someone you like, and no matter what kind of personal things were going down and John writing songs about me and all that stuff, I still didn't feel like the coolest thing in the world was to go and sue them. But it actually turned out to be the only way to stop Klein, so I had to go and do it.

Then it all started to come out, you know, that Klein had persuaded George – I don't know how much of this is libelous –

Our lawyers will take out whatever is libelous.
Klein made his way into George's big songwriting company, which is George's big asset. The main one was the song ""Something,"" that was on Abbey Road. That was kind of George's great big song, George's first big effort, and everyone covered it and it was lovely and made him lots of money that he could give away, which is his thing, you know. It was a great thing for him. Well, it turns out that Klein has got himself into that company. Not only paid 20% [the percentage Klein claimed to have gotten from Abbey Road] – there's a thought now that he's claiming he owns the company!

It's those kinds of little weird trips. Now the only good thing I feel is that I wasn't wrong. I would have felt really bad if I was wrong and the guy was really a goodie all along and I'd gone and stuck my big nose in there like the pot calling the kettle black. But it turns out he is the type of man who wants to own it for himself and not the type of man who believes the artist should have it and do what he wants with it, which is what I believe.

He was once quoted in New York magazine as saying he was going to roast your ass.
Yeah, well, he never did, you know, and that's cool. He wouldn't get near my ass to roast it, anyway. Punk.
You mentioned you had to sue the other three to get at Klein. What was Klein doing that made you have to sue?
Basically, I was being held to my obligations under an old contract. I would have to just sit, lump it, and let him be my manager, which I didn't want.

So I was told I could sue him. I said, ""Great, I'll sue him."" Then they said, ""There's one catch, you have to sue Apple"" – and that meant suing the other three. For two months I sat around thinking, ""I can't do this."" Not that I didn't see the others. I did, and kept asking them to let me out and they said, ""No, Allen says there would be tax complications."" I said, ""I don't give a damn about tax considerations, let me go and I'll worry about the tax considerations. I didn't want to be an ABKCO-Managed Industry."" It was weird. My albums would come out saying ""An ABKCO Company,"" and he wasn't even my manager.

As it turns out, it was the best thing, because that got the receiver in there and froze the money and gave everybody time to think about it. He's still managed to get $5 million transferred to his own company, five million for management [the exact amount is subject matter of present litigation].

He has a very special gift for talking his way. He'll use his Playboy interviews, and he'll probably ask for a Rolling Stone interview after mine. Even a murderer has a great line in his own defense. But he's nothing more than a trained New York crook. John said, ""Anyone whose record is as bad as this can't be so bad."" But that was Lennon-esque crap, which John occasionally did; utter foolishness. Klein had already been convicted on ten counts of income tax. [Criminal docket 66-72 of US District Court, Southern District of New York, shows one Allen Klein found guilty January 29th, 1971, on ten counts of ""unlawfully failing to make & file returns of Federal income taxes and FICA taxes withheld from employees' wages."" Conviction affirmed on appeal by US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit November 19th, 1971.] Somebody who's been convicted ten times can't be all clean. [Growing more emotional] My back was against the wall. I'm not proud of it. But it had to be done. To him, artists are money. To me, they're more than that.

If Klein was the big reason for the breakup of Apple, do you think there would have been difficulties anyway without him?
I think there would have been difficulties. Had the Eastmans come in like I wanted, the others would have feared I was trying to screw everyone for the Eastmans. It would have been a bit hard for the others to swallow, I'm afraid, since the Eastmans were so close to me. But they didn't want to screw anybody, and the way it's turning out they're settling up most of it anyway. Some people say, ""People are all the same in business,"" but they're not.

I think the Apple thing was great. As it turned out, the one thing about business is that it does have to be looked after. If you have paperwork and bills and royalties and accounts and stuff, they all have to be handled very well, or else things get lost and then accountants have great difficulty in making up the final picture for taxes.

Apple was together in a lot of other ways. Although he didn't get treated brilliantly at Apple, it was right for James Taylor to make his first record then. I think it was shameful of them to sue him afterwards, but I think that was largely Klein's instigation because of the way he works. He's kind of ""OK, git the bastard. He's left us and he's a success, let's sue him. We got him, we got his contract.""

But I still think all the records that came out of it, Billy Preston and James Taylor, Badfinger, Mary Hopkin, all the people we did take on all had very good records. George, even with the Radha Krishna Temple, I think that's great stuff. I don't think you can fault any of the artistic decisions. Looking back on it I think it was really a very successful thing.

The main downfall is that we were less businessmen and more heads, which was very pleasant and very enjoyable, except there should have been the man in there who would tell us to sign bits of paper. We got a man in who started to say, come on, sign it all over to me, which was the fatal mistake.

Just as I was going to do a radio show interview the other day, just as I was walking in, this feller walked up to me and said, ""Hello, Paul,"" and I thought I'd seen him somewhere before. He looked kind of middle-aged, 50ish, and I thought, ""What's he want with me? Looks a bit dubious."" He pushed a little bit of paper in me hand, he said, ""I don't want to embarrass you, Paul, I'm sure you know what this is all about, but I've got my job to do."" A wife and three kids, all that. So I walked on, muttering, looked at the bit of paper and it says ""ABKCO hereby sue you, John, George, Ringo and everything you've ever been connected with,"" in so many words, companies I'd never even heard of. ""Sue you all for the sum of $20 million."" That is the latest little line.

I'm not trying to be immodest by classing myself with Van Gogh or with the biggies in the artistic world, but it is just a pure continuation of that kind of story. The whole idea of whoever makes the thing not being given the profits of it isn't a new idea. I think it's a joke, trying to sue us for that amount of money. It is just purely that he thinks, in some way, that he owns us. The laugh is that on that whole Klein thing there is one key thing which I luckily never would sign, so I feel a little bit out of that one, I must say.


Linda mentioned Lew Grade's claim that she couldn't write.
That was an old one. Around that time we had millions of suits flying here, flying there, George wrote the ""Sue Me, Sue You Blues"" about it. I'd kicked it all off originally, having to sue the other three Beatles in the High Court, and that opened Pandora's box. After that everybody just seemed to be suing everybody.

Meanwhile Lew Grade suddenly saw his songwriting concessions, which he'd just paid an awful lot of money for, virtually to get hold of John and I, he suddenly saw that I was now claiming that I was writing half my stuff with Linda, and that if I was writing half of it she was entitled to a pure half of it, no matter whether she was a recognized songwriter or not. I didn't think that was important, I thought that whoever I worked with, no matter what the method of collaboration was, that person, if they did help me on the song, should have a portion of the song for helping me. I think at the time their big organization suddenly thought, ""Hello, they're pulling a fast one, they're trying to get some of the money back,"" whereas in fact, it was the truth. So they slapped vast amounts on us, I can't remember what.

I wrote Sir Lew Grade a long letter saying, ""Don't you think I ought to be able to do this and do that and don't you think I've done enough and don't you think I'm OK, and – Hey, man, why have you gotta sue me?"" He wrote me back a very rational letter. I can't remember exactly what it said, but it was a very nice letter. He's actually OK, Lew, he's all right.

You did a TV show for him.
After it, yeah, that's right. All the suits were dropped by then. Bit me tongue ...

When was the last time you saw George?
George? It's been a little while.

Had George invited you to the Bangla Desh benefit?
George invited me, and I must say it was more than just visa problems. At the time there was the whole Apple thing. When the Beatles broke up, at first I thought, ""Right, broken up, no more messing with any of that."" George came up and asked if I wanted to play Bangla Desh and I thought, blimey, what's the point? We're just broken up and we're joining up again? It just seemed a bit crazy.

There were a lot of things that went down then, most of which I've forgotten now. I really felt annoyed – ""I'm not going to do that if he won't bloody let me out of my contract."" Something like that. For years there had been problems as to why the other three felt they couldn't just rip up our partnership agreement. I thought it was crazy if we had split up as a band to have this piece of paper still going on. We were all tied into it and I wanted to break it up and they said, ""Tax, you can't."" Klein was saying, ""You can't do it, lads, you've got to stay together,"" and I think I know why he was saying it. He was telling the others it was tax and it was impossible and stuff.

There was an awful lot of that, and a lot of what I did around about then was just out of bitterness at all that. I thought, ""This is crazy, no one likes me enough to just let me go, give me my little bit of the proceeds and let me split off."" It was a little tit-for-tat, if you're not going to do this for me, I'm not going to do that for you. I tend to see the others now just for business. It's a bit daft, actually. That's why I'm so hot to get these business things over with.

You were hoping to do it today, I gather.
Yeah, there was a little thing ... you see, each time one of us will get hot for a meeting. Say me, I just got me visa and I got all hot for a meeting. I rang John up, and John was keen to do it. He was going to fly in today from L.A. to New York. Great! I was going to be here; John was going to be here. Then I rang Ringo, and Ringo couldn't figure out what we were going to actually say, outside of ""Hi, there."" And he didn't want to come all the way to New York from England, he was just getting settled for Christmas. So he was a bit down on it, that kind of blew it out. Then I called John and he said he was talking to George and George was having some kind of visa problems. So it's a bit difficult to get the four of us together. But it will happen soon.

Lee said that the show you'll do for Phoenix House as part of the arrangement for your visa will be part of a tour.
The only thing now, obviously, is that it's dependent on getting a band together. If we can get something together in the early months of 1974, then we're hoping to come to the States, do a nice tour here. The Phoenix House people helped to get me in. It's a good cause. We just went down to see one of their branches in East Harlem, just now. It's fantastic. I wasn't thinking it would be much, I thought it would be a bit depressing. But it's a beautiful place. There's a lot of love in that place. And it's not the kind of a state thing. There's discipline, too, but the discipline comes out of love. That way no one minds the discipline. If you just start off with discipline and nothing else, a lot of the kids find it hard to do it. But they're all very self-supporting now. It's a great place, I must say. Anyone who's in trouble with drugs, pills, junk or whatever, should take a look in the Phoenix House.

What was the reaction of the kids when you went in there?
Great. We just shook hands. Their choir sang some songs and we went on a little tour of the house. There was a guy telling us about encounter meetings, how he was putting the bathroom in, doing all the plumbing himself – they're all very proud, because they're all people who almost messed up. They just made it, and most of them look like they can really go on to great strength because of it.

Would you like this to be a big proper tour or small, like your university tour?
A big proper tour. I think if you're coming to the States, you can't do it funky. I don't think I could, anyway. I think now I'll be ready to do a big concert tour, although I find it hard to imagine at the moment.

Now that you're in New York, I suppose the rumors will start again. There'll be a Beatles reunion of some sort?
Well, I must say, like as far as getting together as we were, as the Beatles were, I don't think that'll ever happen again. I think now everyone's kind of interested in their little personal things. I kind of like the way we did Band on the Run, the way we did it. Something we've never done before, and it's very interesting. But I do think that I for one am very proud – although I don't like the word proud, it tends to be – ex-servicemen have used the word ... if you know what I mean ... ""proud of my country"" ... but I will use the word – I am proud of the Beatle thing. It was great and I can go along with all the people you meet on the street who say you gave so much happiness to many people. I don't think that's corny. At the time obviously it just passes over; you don't really think they mean it. Oh, yeah, sure, and you shake their hand or whatever.

But I dig all that like mad now, and I believe that we did bring a real lot of happiness to the times. So I'm very proud of that kind of stuff and consequently I wouldn't like to see my past slagged off. So I would like to see more cooperation.... if things go right, if things keep cool, I'd like to maybe do some work with them; I've got a lot of ideas in my head what I'd like, but I wouldn't like to tell you before I tell them. We couldn't be the Beatles-back-together again, but there might be things, little good ventures we could get together on, mutually helpful to all of us and things people would like to see, anyway.

I wouldn't rule everything out, it's one of those questions I really have to hedge on. But, I mean, I'm ready. Once we settle our business crap – there was an awfully lot of money made, of course, and none of it came to us, really, in the end. Virtually, that's the story. So I'd kind of like to salvage some of that and see that not everything's ripped off.

Through all that kind of bitterness I tended to think like John a bit, ""Oh, the Beatles ... naww ... Crap."" But it really wasn't. I think it was great. So I'd like to see that cooled out and restored to its kind of former greatness, agree that it was a good thing and continue in some kind of way. I don't see gettin' the Beatles back together – there's certain things we could do quite quietly and still produce some kind of ongoing thing. I don't think you'll ever get anyone to give up all their individual stuff now; everyone's got it going too well now.

Would you consider the Ringo album an example of that type of cooperation?
Yeah, but I think more than that ... I think that's a beginning; that shows what someone can do just if he asks. That's all he did. He just asked us all. So that's what I like, that no one says, ""Naw, you go on and make your own album."" So if it's that easy then lots of things could be done in the future. And I'd like to see some great things done.

The spelling """"Tacarimba La Tumba Del Fuego Santa Maliga Sacategas Lo Onto Del Sol Y Cruz"""" is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of Side By Side By Sondheim (available for rental only). This version of the song, however, misspells Llanfair PG (presumably to approximate the pronunciation), and has the lyric """"...today's the last I'll be spreading"""" rather than """"spending"""". It would seem, therefore, that this source cannot be considered canonical. This rendering of the place name does accord with Millicent Martin's recording on the Side By Side By Sondheim cast album, however.

The published version of the song, as contained in The Hansen Treasury of Stephen Sondheim Songs (Charles Hansen Music & Books, 1977), has the lyric printed as """"Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz"""", and, being a printed source (as opposed to handwritten, as is the vocal score), can presumably be considered definitive. Linda Lavin's pronunciation on the original cast recording of The Mad Show (for which the song was written) follows this spelling, which would suggest that the printed version is correct.

2890,"Kathy Griffin predicts career is over, says Trump 'broke me'

Embattled comedian Kathy Griffin says she's not afraid of Donald Trump and plans to keep making fun of him but maintained that she's sorry for a video that depicted her holding a likeness of the president's severed, bloody head.

At a rambling press conference Friday, Griffin tearfully predicted her career is over and said Trump ""broke me."" Since the video was posted Tuesday, she has lost her job co-hosting CNN's New Year's Eve special and had all her upcoming comedy shows cancelled. Trump, first lady Melania Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have publicly criticized the video.

Griffin, who asserted that she has been contacted by the Secret Service, said the Trumps are ""trying to ruin my life forever.""

""The president, the first lady and the Secret Service have all made very clear their view on those thoughts,"" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said.

Griffin, 56, repeated her claim that the video was a parody, meant as a pointed comeback to Trump's remark last summer that former Fox News Channel personality Megyn Kelly had ""blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of wherever.""

""I'm not laying down for this guy,"" she said in one defiant moment. ""I'm going to keep making jokes about this guy.""

Republican Party spokesman Mike Reed called the press conference a ""desperate attempt"" to change the conversation.

""Kathy Griffin's career was over long before she attempted to make a disgusting joke about decapitating the President,"" Reed said. ""What she did was wrong and President Trump and his family have every right to condemn it.""

The California GOP later sent out a fundraising email calling Griffin's photo shoot disrespectful and obscene.

Griffin appeared surprised at the number of cameras and reporters in a packed conference room at her lawyer's office, her hands shaking at one point when she took a sip of water. She switched between contriteness to combativeness during the press conference, during which she attempted several nervous jokes that drew laughs mostly from her attorney, Lisa Bloom.

Bloom said the comedian has a First Amendment right to make fun of the president.

""Whether or not you get, or like, her artistic expression, in America, Kathy has the right to parody the president,"" Bloom said. ""She never imagined it would be misinterpreted as a threat of violence against Trump.""

Bloom, a former truTV anchor and lawyer Gloria Allred's daughter, has represented Wendy Walsh, who has accused former Fox News Channel personality Bill O'Reilly of hurting her career after she spurned his advances. O'Reilly has denied the accusations

Backlash against Griffin has continued to grow. Griffin said five of her performances have been canceled this week.

Venues in New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and California canceled upcoming shows. The Community Arts Theater in Williamsport, Pa., posted on its website that the show had been dropped ""due to the recent controversy surrounding Kathy Griffin and the concern for the safety and security of our patrons and staff.""

Sen. Al Franken also dis-invited Griffin from an event promoting his new book, ""Giant of the Senate.""

""After hearing from many Minnesotans who were rightfully offended, I've come to the conclusion that it would be best for her not to participate in the event we had previously scheduled,"" the Minnesota Democrat said Thursday, a day after he had said she was still welcome. ""I understand why Minnesotans were upset by this, and I take that very seriously.""

He said what Griffin did ""was inappropriate and not something that should be anywhere in our national discourse.""

An endorsement deal with Squatty Potty also ended.

Though Griffin apologized within hours of the images appearing online Tuesday, they were met with swift and widespread condemnation.

Trump later tweeted that Griffin ""should be ashamed of herself"" for posting the images.

New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Thursday called Griffin ""disgusting"" and said the photo was ""completely outrageous.""

Even Anderson Cooper, her CNN co-host for the New Year's Eve show, condemned the images. Griffin said she has not spoken to Cooper since, and appeared visibly upset and struggled to speak when fielding questions about Cooper.

The comic has faced controversies before for her abrasive humor, but none as widespread as the one generated by Tuesday's images.

This story has been corrected to show that Griffin accused the Trumps of ""trying to ruin my life forever,"" not ""my rights.""

AP writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this story.

2618,"Kirsten Dunst suddenly breaks down in tears at Cannes Film Festival

She gained global recognition for her role in Interview With The Vampire at the tender age of 12, so she is no stranger to commanding attention on the red carpet.

But new shots have emerged of Kirsten Dunst suddenly breaking down in tears as she attended The Beguiled premiere during the 70th annual Cannes Film Festival in the South of France on Wednesday.

Making a dramatic red carpet appearance, the accomplished  actress, 35, was seen crying as she stepped out in a fairytale plunging ballgown to promote the film.

In unexpected scenes, Kirsten found herself overwhelmed with emotion, catching the attention of onlookers as she wiped away the tears.

Quick to join her were co-star Elle Fanning, dressed in strapless lilac gown, and the director of the film Sofia Coppola, dressed in a black padded jacket.

The smiling reaction from the duo suggested the Golden Globe nominee was tears of happiness.

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Kirsten Dunst for comment.

In spite of it being an emotional night, Kirsten looked beautiful in a full-length prom queen-style gown.

The Virgin Suicides starlet pinned her golden locks back, letting only a few wisps fall forward to frame her face.

But Kirsten's stunning appearance was not marred by her tears as her slick of scarlet lipstick and eyeliner remained perfectly in place.

Touched by the night's emotions, she clasped her hand to her chest as she appeared to confide in her co-star Colin Farrell.

The actress did not publicly share the reason to why she suddenly burst into tears.

Later she was seen laughing and smiling with pals after an unexpectedly eventful red carpet appearance.

Kirsten was promoting her movie, The Beguiled, which tells the story of an injured solider who seeks shelter in an all girls' boarding school.

As the drama unfolds and the serviceman (Colin Farrell) tries to win the hearts of the women who nurse him.

Dangerous rivalries begin to form between the women (played by Kirsten, Elle Fanning and Nicole Kidman) as a result of sexual temptation.

During filming for a previous movie, the director had asked Kirsten to lose weight but she had refused.

Recalling the incident, she told Variety: 'I’m eating fried chicken and McDonald’s before work. So I’m like, 'We have no options!

'I’m sorry I can’t lose weight for this role.''

'It’s so much harder when you’re 35 and hate working out.'

2901,"Anderson Cooper on Kathy Griffin: 'I hope she bounces back'

Anderson Cooper has made it clear that he isn’t pleased with Kathy Griffin‘s controversial photo of Donald Trump, but the CNN anchor says he hopes his longtime friend can make a comeback after the headline-making ordeal.

“I don’t want anybody’s career to be destroyed because they do something unfortunate and inappropriate,” Cooper said during his Friday appearance at Arizona’s Comerica Theatre alongside Andy Cohen, according to USA Today.

He later added: “Look, I wish her well and I hope she bounces back and keeps doing what she does best, which is make people laugh.”

Griffin has been at the center of a media storm since she posed for a photo with a replica of Trump’s bloodied, decapitated head in her hand last month. She later acknowledged in a Twitter video that she “crossed the line” with the display.

She apologized again at an emotional press conference as CNN fired her from her annual New Year’s Eve hosting duties alongside Cooper.

“CNN made the decision not to bring her back,” Cooper said at Friday’s event. “I had nothing to do with it, but I certainly understand why they made that decision.”

In the wake of the photo, Cooper condemned Griffin’s action in a tweet, writing, “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.”

The journalist noted that he had a right, as Griffin’s friend, to speak out against the picture.

“People were assuming I was somehow responsible for this and I just felt I should point out that I actually think this is pretty important as somebody who works overseas and, you know, journalists get beheaded and this is not a joke,” he said.

In today's installment of ""Why Is This Happening?"" a reboot for American Idol is reportedly already on the table-and Kanye West is a sought-after potential judge.

Although the famed singing competition ran for an impressive 15 seasons and ended less than a year ago (the series finale aired on April 7, 2016), RadarOnline.com reports that NBC is pursuing the Chicago rapper to join the judging panel for a revival of the show, thanks to former host and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer, Ryan Seacrest.

""Ryan Seacrest has put his name forward during his negotiations to come back as host and NBC are salivating over it,"" an anonymous source told the site. Apparently, West is at ""the very top of the wish list"" above Simon Cowell, and he's already started ""grilling"" Jennifer Lopez, who became an Idol judge in 2010, about the position.

""It's not an easy gig, but the offer he's got is proving to be very hard to refuse,"" the source added.

If he joins, this wouldn't be his first time making an appearance on the show. He actually made a cameo last season during the open call when he did a mock audition for the series. Kim Kardashian was there proudly supporting him, too.

Sure, Kanye judging on Idol would make for interesting TV, but the idea of rebooting a long-running show less than a year after it ended? It's gonna be a no from me, dawg.

The magazine further claimed that DiCaprio, whose name has been involved with various supermodels and even with his Titanic co-star Kate Winslet lately, is no more interested in love life as well.

""He used to be the life of the party. Now he won't let any woman near him,"" the source further claimed.

Gossip Cop looked over the matter and busted the website for making up false news about the Inception actor as some of the actors' close pals called the magazine's report as 'nonsense.'

Given that, the actor was recently spotted attending Drake's birthday party in Los Angeles with his pals Jamie Foxx and Tobey Maguire.

Besides that, last week he was also joined by Robert Pattinson and The Weeknd for his own birthday party at The Highlight Room in LA. A few weeks ago, he was spotted hanging out with a bunch of friends in New York City as well.

And like we said before, it's not like he doesn't have options. Just because he messed things up with Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez — who've both since moved on — doesn't mean women wouldn't line up to marry him.

Most recently, the singer has been linked to sports reporter Rosalyn Gold-Onwude after she accompanied him to the NBA Awards. Apparently, the duo is ""just friends"" right now, but you never know with the rapper.


""Drake has a bunch of booty calls he can dial up when he feels the need, and he has a lot of female friends, so he’s not lacking in the woman department,"" the source added. ""Drake’s really focused on his music right now and doesn’t want the drama that always seems to come with the women he dates — he prefers an easy and chill life.""

We don't blame him for wanting something more serious, and hey, when he's ready, he knows where to find us. Just dial that hotline bling, Drizzy.

I love how I specifically tried in a polite manner to engage in meaningful dialogue here, and asked you to respond in a way to help me understand why you refuse to accept the submission.  Your 2-line response was the equivalent of """"nana-nana boo-boo,"""" as far as I am concerned. Let's dissect these 2 lines.

""""::you don't understand propaganda.""""
That is a loaded statement if I ever read one. I have read up on the term propaganda, thanks very much, and my readings are not simply limited to this website, which I feel is narrow in its scope. I have been on a program that toured the death camps of Poland and studied the use of propaganda in Nazi Germany. I am currently awaiting a response from a PhD who has lectured and studied the use of propraganda in the media/industry, and it is with respect to our point of contention here. Funny, I can't find any work you have done on this subject, Mr. Jensen, yet you seem to be trying to claim superior academic grounds here. I have made an attempt to engage in meaningful dialogue, and you response above clearly shows you cannot or will not make an effort to present factual arguments to prove such a comment. 

""""You use the word to denounce advertising for products you consider harmful.""""
I am not denouncing advertising for products I consider harmful, and this is what you need to understand, because I have stated this on multiple occasions in many different ways. This statement you have just made is a personal attack. Additionally, it is incorrect. I don't consider the product to be harmful. It is harmful. This is not an opinion, but a restating of facts by the IARC/WHO, and health organizations worldwide, based on the overwhelming body of evidence that is available. If it were simply an opinion, I can understand why you could be frustrated. But the irony, Mr. Jensen, is that the fact that you and others believe that this is simply an opinion is possibly the result of hearing or reading propaganda used by those in the tanning industry to cloud the picture. Tanning bed exposure is strongly associated with skin cancer, among other health risks (please take the time, I urge you, to read any or all of the references I quoted in my submission, all from established medical journals). The industry claims that these risks are not existent or are insignificant, says that UV exposure is more controlled in a tanning bed (not proven whatsoever), and claims health benefits of tanning bed use that are either unproven (e.g. cancer prevention, """"base tan""""), exaggerated, and can be achieved through safer means (e.g. Vitamin D exposure). 

So please enlighten me, Mr Jensen, as to what propaganda is? Is propaganda not """"a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of the community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument?"""". That's the definition on the wiki page, right? I am sure you have head of a systematic review - that is when an established researcher evaluates all of the evidence for and against an exposure, and concludes if the body of evidence favours a hypothesis. It is the most balanced and unbiased way to assess an intervention or exposure. Well, that's what I use, and that's what the World Health Organization used, when they came to an unbiased conclusion that UV exposure from tanning beds (as well as the sun) is a carcinogen, in the same class as cigarettes. In my submission, I think I clearly showed that there are many in the tanning industry and their associated organizations who have reported only the small studies that show their point of view, but neglect to mention the overwhelming amount of evidence that goes against their points, including the systematic reviews I mention. Is this not the same as """"presenting one side of an argument"""" to """"influence the attitude of the community""""? Or, is it that, as you say, I just """"don't understand propaganda""""? 

I have to say it yet again to you, because I think this is such an important point that I have to drive home - this is not my """"opinion"""". 1) Tanning beds cause more harm than good, fact. 2) Tanning industry sites present the good (which is partly true) and negate the bad (partly false), and this is also a fact. If you can find me a tanning industry association that clearly presents a balanced view, you show it to me because this would run counter to the principle of """"good business"""" - its impossible for an industry that causes harm to remove a conflict of interest when weighing evidence for or against their product, and the result is advertising that is propaganda. 3) The industry has used scapegoats/diversion tactics (e.g. suggesting that Cancer Society and Neutrogena are connected in an elaborate scheme to sell skin products through fear mongering, stating that the government is taking responsibility away from parents to make decisions on behalf of their children, blaming o",0

Pregnant Kylie Jenner Is 'Very Self-Conscious' About Her Changing Body, Says Source
Since Kylie Jenner’s pregnancy was confirmed nearly two months ago, the social media mogul has largely remained out of the spotlight — and she intends to stay that way, at least for now.

“Kylie is only trusting her closest friends and her sisters right now. She wants to reveal things on her own terms but she’s of course having fun teasing everyone. She knows all the attention is on her and her baby bump, but she won’t share until she wants to,” a source close to the Kylie Cosmetics founder tells PEOPLE.

In September, multiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE that the 20-year-old reality star is due in February with her first child — a baby girl — with rapper Travis Scott, whom she has been dating since earlier this year after splitting from her on-again, off-again boyfriend Tyga in April.

“Travis is so excited about the baby. They’re both trying to enjoy this time for themselves and keep it private as long as they can. They know it’s going to be a frenzy when they do come out,” an insider close to the 25-year-old rapper tells PEOPLE.

“Travis is crazy about Kylie and he feels so lucky to have her and the baby,” adds the insider. “The family has been welcoming — they know how important it is to Kylie that everyone gets along.”

Although the couple is elated about becoming parents, the expectant Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is feeling self-conscious about her figure.

“Her body is changing and she’s very self-conscious about it,” says the source. “She’s always been insecure that she’s not as curvy or pretty as her sisters.”

Despite having feelings of insecurity as a result of her changing shape, the Lip Kit business mogul has her loving and supportive boyfriend by her side.

“Kylie and Travis are very happy together,” the source shares. “They spend time away from the spotlight and he’s been supportive.”

While news of Jenner’s pregnancy was unexpected, a source previously told PEOPLE that those close to her are thrilled about the couple’s little bun in the oven.

“The family has known for quite some time. She is really excited and so is Travis,” said a source close to the KUWTK star. Added another insider, “It is an unexpected but completely amazing turn of events that she could not be more excited or thrilled about. Everyone is overjoyed for her.”

The reality star’s baby won’t be the only new member joining the famous KarJenner brood: Jenner’s older sister Kim Kardashian West is expecting her third child (via surrogate) with husband Kanye West. And days after Jenner’s pregnancy was revealed, multiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE that Khloé Kardashian and her NBA boyfriend, Tristan Thompson — whom she has been dating since September 2016 — are expecting a baby together.

2768,"J-Rod! Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez on Love, Beauty, and Redemption

Despite the surreal fame—and baggage—carried by Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez, their relationship makes perfect sense. Both started from modest backgrounds, hit the big time fast, and had to battle their own demons to survive. The new couple discuss everything from their nerve-racking first date to the “reveals” that forged their bond.

Despite the surreal fame—and baggage—carried by Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez, their relationship makes perfect sense. Both started from modest backgrounds, hit the big time fast, and had to battle their own demons to survive. The new couple discuss everything from their nerve-racking first date to the “reveals” that forged their bond.

‘It was just one of those things where you feel compelled to do something you wouldn’t normally do,” says Jennifer Lopez, explaining how she and retired Yankee superstar Alex Rodriguez, who made their red-carpet debut as a couple last spring at the Met Gala, came to be a modern Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio—that is, if Monroe and DiMaggio had been happy, highly functional fortysomethings who had apparently done battle with their demons and emerged the victors. It was last winter as she was having lunch in Beverly Hills that she saw Rodriguez walk by. “I almost yelled out ‘Alex,’ but I am the shyest person when it comes to things like that,” she says. When she went outside, he was still there, facing away from her. “I could literally just have walked away,” she says. “But I walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say ‘Hey.’ “I had just come from a promo for my show, Shades of Blue [in which she plays N.Y.P.D. detective Harlee Santos], so I’m dressed like my character, like a boy—Timberlands, jeans, curly short hair. He looks at me. I say, ‘It’s Jennifer.’ He says, ‘You look so beautiful.’ ” She and I are sitting on a stone patio at Lopez’s new house in Bel Air, overlooking an infinity pool and a lush green lawn with a double-size swing, which she points out is perfect for her nine-year-old twins, Emme and Max. The house is light-filled, sprawling, and warm, with wood-beamed ceilings, stone walls, plush low-slung sofas, big pillows, bowls filled with cut roses, and artwork by collagist Peter Tunney. “GRATTITUDƎ,” one piece spells out. It’s a portmanteau of “gratitude” and “attitude” that could define Lopez. Wearing a cropped turtleneck sweater, skinny jeans, high Christian Louboutin boots, and impressive diamond earrings, she is as startlingly beautiful at 48 as she was at 28—if not more so. “We walked into this house, and I said, ‘This is where I want my kids to grow up,’ ” she says. “You have to imagine your life, and what you want to be in it, and I imagined we would be very happy here no matter what.”

Happy, naturally, has turned out differently from what she imagined. Just hours after Rodriguez met her in Beverly Hills, he called her, and they agreed to have dinner a few nights later. She told him that she remembered meeting him on a baseball diamond, 12 years earlier. Her then husband, Marc Anthony, had thrown out the first pitch of a New York Mets game, but the cameras captured Lopez and Rodriguez shaking hands and locking eyes. “You don’t have to say you remember if you don’t,” she told him. “Shea Stadium, during a subway series,” he responded. Just then, Rodriguez walks out of the house to join us on the patio. “I was telling her about the tap,” she says to him. “But there were two taps,” he says. She turns to me. “There was another very significant tap on the shoulder,” she says. Before we get to that tap, we talk about their first date, when they met for dinner at the Hotel Bel Air. “He was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative!” she says. “I think he thought I was going to be this loud person, but I’m not. I just listen. So he’s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn’t normally talk about on a first date. I don’t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. Then I knew he was nervous because he asked me if I wanted a drink. I said, ‘No, I don’t drink,’ and he asked if I minded if he had one. He was nervous, and it was really cute.” “I didn’t know if it was a date,” Rodriguez says. “Maybe we were seeing each other at night because of her work schedule. I went in uneasy, not knowing her situation.” He continues: “It would be incredibly productive for me to sit with one of the smartest, greatest women in the world, especially for a guy like me who is coming through tough times, rehabbing himself, re-establishing himself to folks out there. I thought it would be a win-win no matter what.” Then: “She told me around the third or fourth inning that she was single,” he says. “I had to get up and go re-adjust my thoughts. I went to the bathroom and got enough courage to send her a text.” “So I’m sitting there and he’s walking back, and I get a text,” Lopez continues. “It says . . . ” She looks significantly at Rodriguez. “You can tell her!” he says. “ ‘You look sexy AF,’ ” she tells me. They both laugh. “And then it took a turn,” Lopez says. “The fire alarm went off, and we had to evacuate.” I laugh, thinking she’s being metaphorical. “No, really,” she says. “The fire alarm went off!”

But about that other tap. This one was metaphorical. In August 2016, when Rodriguez announced his retirement from baseball, with his mother and his daughters Natasha and Ella in the stands, four runs short of 700 home runs, he said, “Baseball has a funny way of tapping you on the shoulder when you least expect it and telling you that it’s the end.” It’s a year later, and now, he says, “I’m thinking about one door closing and another opening, and if that first door doesn’t close, well, there isn’t that second tap.” Rodriguez’s story about the tap is a poignant reminder that this isn’t just another love story. It’s the story of two people with rich and at times tumultuous pasts, which are part of the reason they have a present as a couple. “We are very much twins,” he says. “We’re both Leos; we’re both from New York; we’re both Latino and about 20 other things.” “I understand him in a way that I don’t think anyone else could, and he understands me in a way that no one else could ever,” she says. “In his 20s, he came into big success with the biggest baseball contract [at the time]. I had a No. 1 movie and a No. 1 album and made history. We both had ups and downs and challenges in our 30s, and by our 40s we’d both been through so much. And more importantly than anything, we had both done a lot of work on ourselves.” Lopez, whose parents came from Puerto Rico, grew up in the Bronx, where she shared a bedroom with her two sisters. She famously left home at 18 to make it as a dancer, and burst on the scene in 1991 as one of the Fly Girls on Fox’s In Living Color, the hit comedy series. She quickly parlayed her luminous beauty, talent, and sheer workaholism into a series of starring roles, including Marisa in Maid in Manhattan, which grossed more than $150 million worldwide. Of their first date Lopez recalls, “I don’t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. . . . He was nervous, and it was really cute.” Being a movie star wasn’t enough for Lopez. She also released a string of hit albums and became a fashion icon. In 2003, she signed a lucrative endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton. “Now it’s odd if you’re a celebrity and you don’t serve as the spokesperson for a brand,” says Benny Medina, her longtime manager, whom Lopez credits with seeing the potential of celebrities as brands long before it was commonplace. “But back then there were plenty of snarky comments.” In 2013, Lopez was granted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the following year she became the first female artist to receive a Billboard Icon Award; her net worth has been estimated at more than $300 million. “There are people who put their feet in other people’s footsteps,” says Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, who was once Lopez’s agent and is now a partner in her production company. “Jennifer had no footsteps in front of her, so much of the terrain had to be forged.”

There was a cost, Lopez learned. “When you have that type of success at a young age you have to navigate it, almost survive it,” she says. “I was the first Latin actress to ever make $1 million from a role, and you feel, Oh God, I have to do something great all the time.” There were the inevitable flops (most prominently Gigli, her movie with then boyfriend Ben Affleck) and three failed marriages, the last of which was with Marc Anthony, the father of her twins. And so her story isn’t just about astounding achievement but also about personal growth and resilience. “I was eviscerated,” she recalls about the press on Gigli. “I lost my sense of self, questioned if I belonged in this business, thought maybe I did suck at everything. And my relationship [with Affleck] self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.” She has also conquered what was once her biggest fear: being alone. Last August, she broke up with dancer Casper Smart in an effort to learn how. “She’s a seeker,” says her close friend Leah Remini, the actress and anti-Scientology activist. “She’s always trying to improve herself, her relationships, be a better friend, a better daughter, a better mother, a better person. She’s not closed-minded.” If self-doubt and self-reflection aren’t what you’d expect from a diva, it’s striking how little diva there is to Lopez these days. Goldsmith-Thomas, who, in 2004, was diagnosed with Stage Three breast cancer, recalls that Lopez would show up for her chemo appointments. “She made me very popular on the chemo ward!,” Goldsmith says. “She’d bring clothing for everyone from her Sweetface line and she’d rub my bald head and talk about dreams. It was really important to talk about the future because she wanted me to know there was one. That girl saved my life.” Rodriguez tells me that Lopez is happiest at home, in pj’s, eating chocolate-chip cookies with friends. She and Rodriguez like to talk in terms of “reveals”: the unexpected moments that tell you who someone else is. An early one for him, he says, was discovering that Lopez was “the role model for health and wellness. She rarely drinks. She tries to get at least eight hours of sleep.” He adds, “That helps explain why she’s so beautiful.” She’s also been willing to take risks to stay relevant, no easy task in a world where female stars are widely believed to have an expiration date. In 2010, she agreed to become a judge on American Idol, which some people derided as a comedown. But it worked. “Viewers who knew only an attention-grabbing siren met a hardworking, self-made, empathetic single mother,” observed Forbes. “No one from my team wanted me to do American Idol except Benny,” Lopez says. “But I felt I had something to offer, and in the back of my mind, I thought, Maybe people will get to know me a little bit better.” She adds, “With reality TV, you can’t hide who you are. You just can’t. It’s going to come through.”

As Lopez was becoming J.Lo, so Alex Rodriguez was becoming A-Rod. He was just 18 and the youngest player in the league when he made his debut with the Mariners, in July 1994. He turned in a series of impressive stats that galvanized the baseball world—like becoming the youngest player to hit 500 home runs. For the 2001 season, he was offered a record-breaking 10-year $252 million contract by the Texas Rangers. In 2004, Rodriguez was traded to the New York Yankees, and in 2007 he negotiated another 10-year deal. Like Lopez, Rodriguez is not a child of privilege. He too was born in New York City. When Alex was eight, his parents, immigrants from the Dominican Republic, moved the family to Miami, where his mother became a secretary in an immigration office and waited tables at night. When he was 10, his dad moved out of the house. As with Lopez, success made him feel not comfort and security but a near-desperate drive to succeed even more. (And you can see how questions such as CAN ALEX RODRIGUEZ PROVE HE’S WORTH $252 MILLION? would foster that attitude in a young athlete.) “My No. 1 goal was to give R.O.I. [return on investment] to owners who believed in me,” he recalls. In 2008, his marriage to Cynthia Scurtis, with whom he had daughters Natasha and Ella, broke up, due to his relationship with Madonna, and his dates with stars from Kate Hudson to Cameron Diaz became tabloid fodder. Plus, there were the injuries: two major hip surgeries, two knee surgeries. “We’re both like this,” Lopez says. “We put so much pressure on ourselves to be great, to be the best all the time. We understood that about each other. When we came together it was ‘Oh my God, I was the same way.’ ”

Rodriguez’s career was ultimately sidelined by the steroid scandal, which rocked Major League Baseball in the mid-2000s. Rodriguez had earlier admitted using performance-enhancing drugs during his time with the Rangers, but adamantly denied he’d continued the practice while with the Yankees. After a protracted fight with both the Yankees and the M.L.B., Rodriguez was suspended for an entire season—one of the largest penalties in baseball history—in early 2014. “I was hoping the suspension would be shorter,” he says today. “I remember when Tony Clark, the head of our union, called me and said, ‘It’s a full season—it’s 162 [games],’ it was a knife to my ribs.” Rodriguez says he didn’t leave his house for seven days. “I thought I’d played my last game. I grew a beard—as much as I can grow it—and didn’t want to see anyone, including my kids.” I ask him what he learned during that year. “Do you have enough time?” he asks. As he talks, Lopez nestles into him. “I started brushing myself off, thinking, How do I come back into the world?” he says. The year off, he realized, could give him the chance to heal not just his body but also his mind. “I felt I could work on myself, understand why I kept making mistakes. . . . In a weird way, 2014 will be the best thing that ever happened to me. It forced a paradigm shift.” He continues: “I remember thinking one night . . . Don’t know if I told you this, babe [he says to Lopez] . . . In the middle of this craziness, I remember it’s three A.M., four A.M., and like many nights, I couldn’t sleep. I’m not a crier, but I’m bawling. . . . My pillows are now soaking wet, and it’s the middle of the night, and I’m thinking I’m the only fucking asshole that gets pocket aces and figures out a way to lose the hand. I was so angry at myself, so pissed off, that it was hard to breathe.” “How did you get through?” I ask. “Help,” he says. “The work I did, that was one of the most painful and most rewarding experiences of my life, and it continues to this day. I tell myself, ‘I’m rounding first base and going to second base. It’s a process.’ ” He says he decided to do like Rocky Balboa, to try to make the team “as a broken-down 40-year-old that didn’t have a lot of allies.” And he succeeded, finishing the season with 33 home runs. “I did that at 40 and 100 percent clean, and no one can take that away from me,” he says. “It told me everything about who I was.” When he retired, he agreed to stay on as an adviser to Yankee owner Hal Steinbrenner and as a mentor to younger players. “From where I came from, that honor is like hitting 800,” he says. This, to Lopez, was a reveal. “The most impressive thing to me was how he did pick himself up and take that opportunity to make himself a better person,” she says. “The hardest times prove who you are. That’s what I love and admire the most about Alex. He doesn’t let anything beat him. He just comes back stronger.” Each believes that if they had been single when they met, 12 years ago, the relationship wouldn’t have worked. “We had to grow and discover ourselves first,” she says. But it also works for another reason. As Goldsmith-Thomas says, “They weren’t afraid to dream, and they are still dreaming, both of them.”

The next night, Lopez is performing her smash show All I Have in Las Vegas. Onstage, she moves seamlessly from the best kind of sexy—with a sense of humor—to a festive Latin-inspired segment, to an utterly moving testimonial to her children, in which she sings Lee Ann Womack’s “I Hope You Dance.” She’s an incandescent performer, partly because, as Remini says, “there is nothing Jennifer does that she does half-assed. When she is in a project, she is in it, devouring it.” “A-Rod’s in the house,” someone from the audience yells. She laughs. Yes, A-Rod is in the house. Although he’s seen the show many times, he’s still watching every detail. He nudges me, pointing out a middle-aged woman in a pink pantsuit dancing ecstatically to “Jenny from the Block.” Then he points out a gay couple in the front row practically swooning after one gets to touch Lopez’s feet. During a segment that’s all New York, with Lopez in a sequined baseball jersey, he nudges me again. “If you look closely, you’ll see what number she’s wearing on her jersey,” he says. It’s 13, his Yankee number. He says, “We are very much twins.” She says, “I understand him in a way that I don’t think anyone else could.” Earlier that day, she and Rodriguez were in Los Angeles at the premiere event for this season’s Shark Tank, in which Rodriguez will be the first Latino shark. At a panel where the sharks discussed the show, the investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban says, “A lot of us were pleasantly surprised that when Alex came in, he knew his stuff cold.” During the red-carpet interviews, Lopez, who is impossibly glamorous in a floor-length tweed coat and aviator sunglasses, hangs at the back of the crowd. “Does it feel weird to be in the background?” I ask. “Noooo,” she says. “I like it. Because I’m out there enough. Some people, it wouldn’t work—they can’t stand not being the one in the spotlight. But not us.”

Their story is also a merger of business empires. Lopez, who back in 2002—way before everyone else was becoming an entrepreneur—launched her fragrance Glow by J.Lo, now has a big portfolio of business interests, which range from her production company to sprawling property holdings. Rodriguez seems to slot right into her world. From a young age, he sought out mentors who could help him build a business that would one day replace his baseball income. During his suspension year, he took investing classes at Columbia and marketing classes at the University of Miami. Today, A-Rod Corp is an investment firm focused on a broad array of industries, including real estate, sports and wellness, media, and entertainment. “I don’t have your traditional formal education,” he says. “Mine comes through reading and passion and grit and collecting a lot of information from my mentors. I’ve never been afraid to say, ‘I don’t know. Can you explain that to me?’ That’s echoed by hedge-fund billionaire Marc Lasry, who has invested with Rodriguez for the last decade. “What’s interesting about Alex is that he’s a sponge,” Lasry says. “He really wants to learn.” Another mentor of sorts is Mary Callahan Erdoes, the C.E.O. of J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management, who met Rodriguez around the time that Lasry did. “You might be expecting something different,” she says. “But from the first day, he had his notebook out. He’s incredibly curious and serious. There’s no nonsense and no pomp and circumstance.” That’s true to this day, Erdoes says, whether he’s attending a JPMorgan-hosted conference on Brexit or a meeting with a hedge-fund manager. “He sits in the front of the room with his notebook out and his hand up, asking questions,” she says. Rodriguez’s innate curiosity—about business, about other people, about fresh concepts—makes him stand out in a world where many people lack that trait. “The real reason people do deals with Alex is that they like him and he’s smart,” says Lasry.

The day after I saw Lopez’s show in Las Vegas, we meet at one of Rodriguez’s latest investments, which he discovered when he was looking for a place to work out in Las Vegas—members of Lopez’s crew had raved about it. Called TruFusion, it offers more than 65 styles of instruction and 35 to 40 daily classes in yoga, Pilates, kettlebell exercises, and battle-rope workouts in heated rooms. Last June, Rodriguez purchased a major stake in the company, and now owns the development rights for all of Florida. President and C.O.O. Jonathan Fornaci says the classes can be so hard that he sees some professional athletes take breaks during them, but “Alex kills it. And immediately afterward he’s drilling down, asking questions that any private-equity analyst would be asking.” I’m warned that the “Down N Dirty Bootcamp” will be hard and sweaty, and it is precisely as advertised. At one point, confused by the welter of instructions—Left! Right! Kettlebell! Weight! Sandbag!—I look over at Lopez and roll my eyes in desperation. “I get confused, too,” she says. “Just watch everyone else.” During some particularly brutal leg lifts, I give up. She does not. In fact, she starts singing. At the end, we’re all sitting on our mats, drenched in sweat and exhausted. Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin”’ is playing.

It’s clear as day that neither of them is hitting Pause. After Vegas, she’s off to New York, where her children are in school, and he’s off to Atlanta, where he’s filming a pilot for a CNBC reality show that will help retired athletes who are struggling financially. Rodriguez says he keeps himself grounded with some key words: “Gratitude and appreciation. When someone offers me a job, I thank the Lord that I have work, and I beg for more work.” And he adds, “We’re really good at reminding each other.” They begin to tell me a story, one in which Lopez is in the bath, and Rodriguez is sitting by the fire in a robe. Looking at my face, he starts laughing. “You’re like, ‘Where are you going with this story, and is it going to get R-rated?’ ” But it’s not R-rated, not at all. He says he got hot from the fire and went to sit on the patio outside their room, with a book and his feet up, in the crisp air. Lopez breaks in. “I came out and said, ‘What are you doing out here?’ He said, ‘Living the dream.’ ” It’s clear from the story that he said it in a way that was free of irony. “I thought, Wow, this person is different,” Lopez says. “Because a lot of people I’ve met in my life, they don’t appreciate what they’re doing and how amazing it is . . . not the greatness of the house, but the moment of sitting there with someone you love, with a family, with healthy kids.” All over the house are pictures of their four children as one family; when I ask Rodriguez which of his businesses he’s most passionate about, he responds, without missing a beat, “My daughters.”

As we drive from TruFusion to a little restaurant in a Vegas strip mall called Greens and Proteins, they say that early in their relationship they’d text each other using the hashtag #bloodinbloodout, after the Mexican gangster film that is in some ways about the unbreakable ties of family. At the restaurant, a few people turn and stare, but mostly we’re ignored, probably because no one can quite believe it’s them. He’s in workout clothes; she’s wearing a cropped pink sweatshirt, no makeup, and has her hair pulled back in a bun. When we sit down, Rodriguez asks what surprised me the most about spending time with them. I answer that I was surprised, even shocked, by their genuine interest in other people. But when I walked behind them as they left TruFusion, their hands were touching and they were talking intently. It was normal and natural and easy. And that’s an even better answer: I’m most surprised to see that, out of two often surreal lives, they are managing to make one wonderfully real life. Our essential brief on culture, the news, and more. And it's on the house.

It's no secret that Taylor Swift, 24, and Justin Bieber, 20, are not the best of friends, but they do have one thing in common - they both love the New York Knicks! On Oct. 29, both stars attending the game against the Chicago Bulls and sat just a few rows apart!

The Knicks may have lost the game, but that didn't dim Taylor's spirits. The beautiful singer posted a picture on Instagram with model, Karlie Kloss with the caption, ""Karlie and I had the time of our lives at the Knicks game tonight. See you tomorrow bright and early on Good Morning America!""

Taylor sat court-side alongside her good friend as well as actor, Ben Stiller and his adorable young son, Qinlin. The four seemed to be having an absolutely wonderful time cheering and smiling. Meanwhile, just a few rows back, Justin sat and chatted with Rev. Jesse Jackson for most of the game.

After the devastating loss, Karlie and Taylor headed across the court - with her Knicks shirt in hand - and were not pictured talking with the Biebs at all. While they may not have physically ran into one another, with just a short distance dividing them, we are sure that they were aware of each other's presence.

Taylor is definitely having a moment right now and starting a new chapter in her life. On Oct. 27, the beauty released her album 1989 to rave reviews and has been discussing how much she is loving her new life in New York City.

Taylor said in an interview with Radio Disney, first debuted by HollywoodLife.com, ""I'm a lot less nervous about this album because I'm a lot more confident in the quality of it. With this album, I know for a fact that I'm offering my fans something different than anything they've gotten from me before.""

It looks like Miranda Lambert's absolute worst fear may be coming true. Judging from recent photos, Blake Shelton may really have found himself a younger, skinnier version of his standoffish wife! Blake decided to attend Usher's 35th birthday party and Miranda was nowhere to be found. It's almost like she goes out of her way to avoid Blake when he is around anyone that he works with and then throws it in his face that they're always apart! Anyway, on this particular night she was at home but don't think for a minute that Blake was lonely.

According to Radar Online Blake posed for photos with Lindsey Sporrer and the two were connected at the shoulder all night. You know how Blake is – get him drinking and fidelity goes right out the window. Miranda is no doubt losing her mind over this because let's be serious here- this chick poses a real threat. Miranda knows the drill well because she was once the younger, thinner chick that disrupted Blake's first marriage.

She knows exactly how her husband operates and she also has to realize that Lindsey is exactly his type. Do you think that this is the beginning or real trouble for these two? I mean we have heard for months that they are on shaky ground but they have then presented a united front. Is Lindsey going to be the last straw for Miranda? Will she continue to deny her husband's bad behavior by sharing all of the ways that she double checks and keeps tabs on him?

Louise Henriette de Bourbon-Conti - probably the best example of your obsession with having everything that way you want it; 
Henrietta Anne Stuart - i rearranged the page and added the Template:House of Stuart - clearly a tragedy;
Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre‎ - added titles and styles - where are they; i even tried to compromise by removing the stlyes and putting back the titles but once again you must have your way;
Victoire of France‎ - changed the awful layout along with her sister Princess Louise-Marie of France and Princess Marie Adélaïde of France 

Why?

The latter is quite amusing to me proving that you dont even read the article - you simply revert back because I did it - all I did was move the Template:House of Bourbon (France) to a different part of the page! Then you and your chronic arrogance go and revert it under the claim that there are rv excessive, redundant trivia contained in other articles then as always you groan on an on about the usual rubbish with please don't violate WP:3RR or WP:SOCK WHAT IS YOUR POINT ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

Days after attending the Golden Globes in a bright citron gown, Lena Dunham has achieved the ultimate fashion high: gracing the cover of Vogue.

But it was a long road to achieve covergirl status, Dunham reveals in the magazine's February issue, which hit newsstands Wednesday.

""I felt a lot of shame. Seeing what I thought was people lightening their own load, or lifting their own burdens, by writing about them or singing about them just made the world seem more open,"" Dunham says of dealing with obsessive-compulsive disorder – something her Girls character Hannah Horvath also struggles with.

The 27-year-old also explains the inspiration behind her decision to show nudity and realistic sex scenes on Girls, which one reporter criticized at an HBO press panel last week.

""There was a sense that I and many women I knew had been led astray by Hollywood and television depictions of sexuality,"" she says.

Rumors of Dunham's Vogue cover debut have been swirling for months. Editor-in-chief Anna Wintour even attended the Girls season three premiere Jan. 6. Dunham Tweeted a simple thank-you message Wednesday.

 The Truth about the 1986 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis 

The story of how Gerry Adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a British Constitutional party.  How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. 

In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:

“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership."""" 

The Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: 

RESOLUTION 162

THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.

b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)

To accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:

That Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read:
 
No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. 

Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. 

Can anybody say that  the wording:

“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”

does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?
Clearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.

Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.

Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necessary, according to the constitution, to give any reason. But you",0

The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. 

Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.

Chris and Jennifer were busy in shooting for their upcoming movie 'Passengers' when the spark of their love life was alleged for the first time. According to some source, the duo was pretty together most of times, which helped in birth of affair rumour.

This news was no new for Chris and Jenny, while it seriously hit his wife Faris. She was throbbed from the news of her husband. Faris herself admitted about her insecurity.

'I know this news is not true, but I am human too; and still I feel too bad of having my husband being involved in such affair rumour.'

As indicated in News Every Day, Anna felt vulnerable when she heard this news for the first time. When the news spread, she wanted it to go off as it was hurting her heart.

Although this rumour spread all over internet and media, it finally turned off when Jennifer herself denied the news. Moreover, she also stated being jealous of this wonderful loving couple.

Jennifer, till now has been linked alleged with countless celebrities but we did not find any one in serious relationship. In an interview with Vogue, she once claimed herself to be lonely girl who spends Saturday nights either with some friends or in her apartment. Further, she also exclaimed about no guys asking her out.

Although it is shocking to know about being no one to be with her every Saturday, we know that she once secretly dated Nicholas Hoult and Chris Martin. As of 2016, she was alleged being linked up with Darren Aronofsky.

Going to the dating history of Chris Pratt, he dated only two girls in his lifetime. In the year 2004, Chris was linked with Emily VanCamp. The couple were together for two years, and then split in the year 2006. The next girl he ever met was his current wife Anna Faris. The duo met in the year 2007 and dated for two years. Then the pair tied knot in the year 2009.

Blake Shelton has had about enough of all the tabloid chatter regarding him and his wife, Miranda Lambert.

Over the past few weeks, rumors have made the rounds that Shelton is cheating on his wife, possibly with actress Lindsay Sporrer, with whom he attended Usher's birthday party. But, in his typical unabashed manner, the singer chose to put a stop to the chatter in the best possible way -- by ""embracing"" the reports, and then making a mockery of them.

Shelton took to Twitter yesterday to write to his over four million followers:

Shelton had previously commented on being a tabloid fixture, telling ""CBS This Morning"": ""I love it. I honestly do love it. I just know, to have that kind of coverage, if I'm popular enough they want to put me and Miranda on that stuff -- that's awesome. I have an album coming out!

After allegedly struggling to silence body-shamers following those nearly-bare butt bikini photos from her Mexican getaway, Kim is 'in tears' over the situation.
Kim Kardashian was said to be trying pretty hard to silence body-shamers following those nearly-bare butt bikini photos from her Mexican getaway with big sister Kourtney Kardashian. And now the 36-year-old socialite is reportedly suffering an ""epic"" meltdown over her cellulite on her butt.

Princess Diana may have had more fun while married into the British royal family than we had originally thought. In her new book, British comedy actress Cleo Rocos says that she, Queen front man Freddie Mercury, and comedian Kenny Everett sneaked Princess Diana into a south-London gay bar, Royal Vauxhall Tavern, in the late 1980s. Rocos recalls the evening in The Power of Positive Drinking, writing that the trio dressed up the beloved late royal in disguise-an army jacket, cap, and sunglasses, according to an account of the story by the A.F.P.-and were able to enjoy themselves covertly thanks to Mercury's popularity in the crowd:

She said she did not know whether Diana was propositioned in the bar in her guise as a male model, but added: ""She did look like a beautiful young man.""

Rocos also claims that Diana enjoyed herself so much that she told the group, ""We must do it again!"" afterward. Amazingly, the undercover gay-bar excursion was not the only activity on the foursome's agenda that day. Per Rocos's recollections, the group spent the afternoon before the trip ""drinking champagne in front of reruns of The Golden Girls with the sound turned down"" and improvising show dialogue with ""a much naughtier storyline."" After asking about the group's plans that night, Diana, ""in full mischief mode,"" insisted on joining. Although Rocos and Everett tried to dissuade her, worried about unsavory headlines if she were detected by paparazzi, Mercury proved the deciding vote, telling them, ""Go on, let the girl have some fun.""

Diana married into the royal family on July 29, 1981.

1234,"""== Attributing and classifying of personalities == 
Invitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed. 
Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains. 

My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania. 
We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here. 
In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). 
We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference. Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. E. g. philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).

NOT since Prince William chose St Andrews as his alma mater has such fevered excitement existed on a university campus, but students hoping to end up sharing a dorm with a prince will have to look a little further afield this time as rumours emerge that Prince Harry is Yale-bound. The 31-year-old royal is thought to be considering Yale Law School in Connecticut as his next move after leaving the army, and the students are understandably excited
""Everyone was talking about it around the campus. Big buzz!"" one student told Page Six, while another on-campus source added: ""Yale would be over the moon to get Harry as a student. Imagine the kind of fundraising they could do.""


No stranger to fundraising himself, Prince Harry launched the Invictus Games in 2014 - a Paralympic-style sporting event for injured servicemen and women - and also works with charities working to support children with HIV/Aids and with African-based charities focused on the conservation of endangered species.

The prince, who graduated from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, has served two tours of duty in Afghanistan as a helicopter pilot, but could - like elder brother Prince William - be looking for a secondary career before he assumes royal life full time.

Possible new ""Twilight"" film can see Kristen Stewart reprising her role as Bella Swan, with a new report claiming that she did not drop movie plans with former beau, Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen). Some reports say that Stewart said no to her reunion project with Pattinson as she is busy with the psychological thriller, ""Underwater."" ""Twilight"" fans however can keep their peace as the actress did not reject playing Bella once more.

Reportedly, Stewart has not dropped the possibility for another film with Pattinson because there has been no official plan for the film yet. According to Gossip Cop, the actress' casting in her upcoming film does not directly affect the saga should it be revived.

On the contrary, it seems the actress hints interest for another ""Twilight"" film. She previously told Press Association (via Metro) that she will be among the first to read the continuation of the saga as soon as Stephanie Meyer publishes it.

""I would definitely be the first to read it, yeah,"" she said. There is no official confirmation from Meyer yet if she will be releasing a new book anytime soon. But it looks like it is the only thing that producers are waiting for to start pre-production of a new movie.

Meanwhile, the actress has opened up about herself with the Sunday Times. ""I didn't talk about my first relationships that went public because I wanted things that are mine to be mine,"" she said. A previous Elle interview shares why she doesn't tend to share much about her personal life. 
But eventually, Stewart realised that she had several eyes on her and that talking about her personal life can benefit someone else. ""It was an opportunity to surrender a bit of what was mine, to make even one other person feels good about themselves,"" she added.

She was in a relationship with Pattinson but the couple broke up in 2013. Last year, the actress came out as a lesbian. She was in a relationship with visual effects producer, Alicia Cargile.

The final ""Twilight"" film was released in 2012. Since then, the actress has appeared in a series of films such as Olivier Assayas' ""The Clouds of Sils Maria,"" for which she won the Cesar Award for Best Supporting Actress. Stewart has also played Jodie Foster's daughter in the thriller ""Panic Room,"" in which she got a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Leading Actress in a Feature Film.

The holiday was so hush-hush that there was no news about it in the media. Kensington Palace also did not release any statement on the behalf of Kate & William.

There is a suspicion brewing among royal watchers that the couple may be having troubles in their marriage. So the holiday may be an effort by both of them to reconcile.

Kate Middleton & Prince William had their vacation on Tuesday, Celebrity Dirty Laundry reports. They celebrated Prince George's third birthday, a week back.

The cars were blacked out to avoid the paparazzi. The Pau-Pyrenees airport where the couple touched down declined to comment on the royal visit.

The couple along with their kids Prince George and Princess Charlotte were visiting the region to meet friends and relation, Daily Mail reports. There were also royal protection officers as well as officers from Scotland Yard.

Taylor Swift seems to be naked in new music video
2017-10-24 16:38:00
She once claimed that she did not need to remove her clothes to sell records. And Taylor Swift has employed a little creative ambiguity to stick to that message, whilst at the same time appearing to be totally naked in a new video.

The 27-year-old US pop star on Monday released a preview of a music video for her latest single, Ready For It, in which she appears unclothed, with geometric lines of lights across her body, although she is likely wearing a nude-coloured bodysuit.

Swift posted three short clips on her Instagram page and within an hour they had been viewed more than 2.5 million times.

In a 2014 magazine interview, the pop star insisted she would not be stripping off like some of her pop rivals.

""I find it relatively easy to keep my clothes on because I don't really feel like taking them off,” she told America's Glamour magazine.

“It's not an urge I have. For me risky is revealing what really happened in my life through music.

“Risky is writing confessional songs and telling the true story about a person with enough details so everyone knows who that person is. That's putting myself out there, maybe even more than taking my shirt off.""

2568,"Is the Queen preparing abdicate?

His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI announced it through the Vatican, to shock and surprise.

A poised Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands revealed it in a video uploaded to YouTube, and King Juan Carlos of Spain confirmed it by signing a parliamentary bill.

Queen Elizabeth, however, has vowed that abdicate is something she will never do.

Abdication is, after all, a dirty word in the corridors of Royal palaces, especially after the earthquake caused when her uncle Edward VIII quit the throne in 1936 to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.

And there is no indication that that will ever change.

Yet with the Queen now into her 92nd year, and with the hard-working Duke of Edinburgh choosing to retire last month at the age of 96, plans are afoot which, if implemented, would see Charles appointed King in all but name.

Palace sources have indicated that the Queen has told her inner circle that, if she is still on the throne at the age of 95, she will ask for a piece of legislation called the Regency Act to come into force – granting her eldest son full power to reign even while she still lives.

I have spoken to a number of high-ranking courtiers who made it clear that preparations for a transition are moving ahead at pace. They have all confirmed that a Regency with Charles taking the lead is now, at the very least, a real possibility.

One senior former member of the Royal Household said: ‘Out of the profound respect the Queen holds for the institution of monarchy and its stewardship, Her Majesty would want to make sure that she has done everything she can for her country and her people before she hands over. She is dutiful to her core.

‘Her Majesty is mindful of her age and wants to make sure when the time comes, the transition of the Crown is seamless.

‘I understand the Queen has given the matter considerable thought and believes that, if she is still alive at 95, she will seriously consider passing the reign to Charles.’

Clarence House – the household of Prince Charles – is making no comment about Plan Regency, as it has been called. However, it is understood to be a matter of increasingly open discussion at court.

But Palace staff responsible for communications have been ordered to be ‘up to speed’ on the 1937 Regency Act, which grants power to the heir apparent ‘in the event of the incapacity of the Sovereign through illness, and for the performance of certain of the Royal functions in the name and on behalf of the Sovereign in certain other events’.

The development is all the more significant as it comes against the backdrop of momentous shifts at court – a series of senior staff changes and departures at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, home to the young Royals.

The Queen’s Private Secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt, 55, resigned his position two weeks ago, sparking turmoil and a ‘wholesale regime change’ – as revealed in The Mail on Sunday.

His shrewd deputy – former banker, political adviser and television executive Edward Young, 50 – will replace Sir Christopher after a suitable handover period.

I understand that a number of other high-profile figures – many loyal to Sir Christopher – are poised to leave the Royal Households at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace after his unexpected exit.

They include Assistant Private Secretary Samantha Cohen, the capable former Press Secretary and Sir Christopher’s number three in the private office. Ms Cohen, who is Australian, is said to be a firm favourite with the Queen.

Falklands and Afghanistan veteran, Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, the Master of the Queen’s Household, is also said to be weighing up his position. Sir Alan Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, had been due to retire at the end of this year but decided to depart when Prince Philip stepped back from public duties, leaving the job to his deputy, Sir Michael Stevens.

At Kensington Palace, the Duchess of Cambridge has hired a new Private Secretary, Catherine Quinn, who is head of the University of Oxford’s Said Business School. It is understood she will take up her new role in October.

Prince William’s Private Secretary, former Ministry of Defence communications expert Miguel Head, and Prince Harry’s Private Secretary, former Blues and Royals Captain Ed Lane Fox, 40, are also said to be considering their options.

Perhaps significantly, there have been no major staff changes at Clarence House, home to Prince Charles.

Of course, the transition to a world in which significantly more Royal duties are undertaken by the younger generations is already well under way. Next month, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will step into their new roles as full-time working Royals, and Prince Harry will be expected to carry out more engagements at his grandmother’s side.

‘As ever, the Queen wants there to be the minimum of fuss,’ said the former member of the Royal Household. ‘Of course, for obvious reasons, abdication is not even a consideration.’

That is not in doubt. On her 21st birthday in 1947 the then Princess Elizabeth took to the airwaves to make one of her earliest radio broadcasts. Speaking from Cape Town, where she was on tour with her parents and younger sister, it was as unequivocal as it was momentous.

‘I can make my solemn act of dedication with a whole Empire listening,’ she said. ‘I should like to make that dedication now. I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.’

It was a conviction that she confirmed in her Coronation Oath on June 2, 1953.

While it may be acceptable for Queen Beatrix and King Juan Carlos to pass the baton to the next generation, Palace aides still believe the ‘A word’ is not part of Her Majesty’s vocabulary.

There is no escaping the passage of time, however, or the fact that the Queen, at 91, is the oldest and longest-serving monarch in the history of these islands – one who is now without the company of Prince Philip, her consort, on the hundreds of engagements she carries out each year.

The monarch is in remarkable health, yet courtiers are increasingly aware that there is only so much a nonagenarian, albeit one with incredible stamina, can realistically be expected to achieve.

Charles has already been filling in for his mother, representing the head of state on foreign trips during her Diamond Jubilee year to Australia and New Zealand.

Earlier this year he went in her place to Canada to mark the nation’s 150th anniversary. On a tour of the Persian Gulf, he represented the Crown and was treated like a king with other Royals bowing to him.

More will no doubt come as the Queen gradually scales back her demanding list of duties.

A Regency, however, would ensure a more formal handover – and, indeed, the Act was considered in more recent times when the Queen first acceded to the throne.

Documents show that following the Coronation of 1953, the young Elizabeth II intervened to ensure that Prince Philip – and not her sister Princess Margaret – would take over as Regent if she were to die or succumb to illness or mental incapacity before Charles, then aged four, reached adulthood. This was not, of course, required.

Times have changed, so with the heir apparent fast approaching his 70th birthday next year, what would it mean in practice today?

Certainly, it is not be a decision to be taken lightly.

To safeguard against a coup, a Regent can only be installed once a decision is taken by at least three of the following: the Sovereign’s consort, in this case the Duke of Edinburgh; the Lord Chancellor, David Lidington; the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow; the Lord Chief Justice, the incoming Sir Ian Burnett; and Master of the Rolls, Sir Terence Etherton.

Clarence House and Buckingham Palace officials have played down this speculation, as one would expect. But as one insider told me: ‘We are in uncharted territory right now – a monarchy in transition with a clear shift in power.’

(deindent) Sorry for kibitzing, but I wanted to be fair to all points of view, even those of the dualists. so I tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.

The thought experiment is this:

 you have one observer
 The observer gets cloned into copy 1 and copy 2 (either Hubert/Yorick or star-trek style)
 The copies diverge, either because of internal noise, or because of the environment

From a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.

This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say """"I am copy 1"""" and copy 2 will say """"I am copy 2"""".

To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).  """,0

2537,"What Taylor Swift's New Make-Under Really Means

Unless you've been living on a tropical island without Wi-Fi, you probably know (at least) a little about the drama that's been following Taylor Swift around for the past year or so. There's a lot to unpack, which has led to both fans and haters speculating that her upcoming album, Reputation, addresses her side of the story.

From her tumultuous relationship with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, to the name-calling the singer received lately, you don't have to surf for long to get caught up. But her latest single, ""Call It What You Want,"" is a major departure from her last three releases and suggests a different vibe for her forthcoming album — and a new beauty look to match.

From what we can tell, the overwhelming response to her fourth single is totally positive. Whether she's admitting defeat by apologizing for all the public squabbles that went down last year, or just simply singing about being happy and in love, there's certainly something different here.

The private videos-turned-music video — at least that's what it looks like to us — appear to deliver a look at a more grounded, new Taylor. (She did say the ""old Taylor"" was dead, if you recall.) Naturally, this softer side of the star, seen riding horses and painting, comes with a make-under, too. That is: No red lipstick in sight, no ""Shake It Off"" bob and blunt bangs, and we even spotted her natural curls. According to Twitter, this might be the real image Swift is ready to bring back.

Whether you think this is Swift giving us raw honesty and vulnerability or it's a clever move for redemption, it's hard to deny the pattern we've seen in Hollywood before. Most recently, Miley Cyrus reigned as the queen of the make-under. Alongside her new album Younger Now, Cyrus was featured on multiple magazine covers and her ""Malibu"" music video where her naked face took center stage.

Only time will tell what this new make-under means the star, but were betting there will be a lot less red lipstick in her future.

2679,"This Is What Justin Bieber Did Instead of Going to the Grammys

Despite earning four nominations for his album Purpose, Justin Bieber had no plans to attend the Grammy awards this year. Rather than sitting at home alone, however, he decided to go out for sushi, and took fans along for the ride on his Instagram Story. (Other bystanders captured a few snaps of him walking into the restaurant as well for a full 360-degree look at what it's like to have dinner with Justin.)

Of course, this move is a statement, and not a subtle one at that. TMZ reportedly spoke to a source that said Justin ""doesn't think the Grammys are relevant or representative, especially when it comes to young singers.""

Regardless, choosing not to show up to an award show for which you have received multiple nominations, and then to highlight that fact by doing something so overtly casual is pretty suspect.

However, this wasn't the only questionable act that went down on Justin's Instagram Live feed this weeknd. He also posted a video in which you hear someone ask him, ""Favorite song at the moment?"" He pauses, and then replies: ""'Starboy,' by The Weeknd,"" before bursting out into laughter, making it clear that the comment was sarcastic. You then hear the second voice in the video say: ""We've gotta end it now. That was too funny.""

But we beg to differ, especially as it's not the first time Justin's taken a swipe at his fellow artist - and it's that consistency that is concerning. This past January, he called The Weeknd's music ""whack,"" so we already knew he wasn't exactly a fan. It's a significant comment mostly because it appears to be a bitter snide from an ex. As we all know, Selena Gomez has been spotted with The Weeknd, and though their relationship hasn't been officially confirmed, there's enough evidence – Justin's response included – to speculate that the two are an item.

Dissing a fellow artist for no reason- and especially when the question posed was open-ended and positive - isn't cool. Doing it to your ex's new partner is as petty as petty gets. If nothing else, it's shown us that Justin has more #feelings about the situation than we realized.

2617,"Photos Of Angelina Jolie In A Wedding Dress Claim To Prove Quickie Marriage To Rando Brit After Brad Pitt Divorce

Photos of Angelina’s Jolie’s wedding dress have been making the rounds on the celebrity rumors circuit these past few months after an In Touch front page cover claimed Angie got married to a British man just eight months after the split with Brad Pitt. This would be Angelina’s fourth marriage if the tabloid’s article was true, but based upon other reports, it seems safe to say this surprise wedding is likely fake news.

Back in April, In Touch ran a cover story declaring, “Angelina’s Shocking Surprise: Wedding In Cambodia! Marriage No. 4 Just 8 Months After Split With Brad.” The tabloid was running with the idea that Angelina Jolie’s divorce from Brad was being fast-tracked in order to allow a new marriage to a “wealthy, 40-something Brit.” Angelina’s dating of this “philanthropist business man” was supposedly being “shielded” from the public “by her closest friends.” Worse, Angelina’s children were supposedly out of the loop and had not yet met their new future father figure despite a wedding being planned.

“A quickie wedding would be the ultimate payback [to Brad Pitt],” claimed an unnamed “family friend” who is the supposed source for In Touch.

While Angelina does have a history of quickly remarrying after her previous divorces, in this case, there are Angelina and Brad’s six kids to consider, making a quick divorce and new marriage very unlikely. In April, Gossip Cop pointed out that “this tabloid has a proven history of making assumptions and trying to mislead its readers” and an unnamed source of their own claimed that Angie’s 2017 wedding rumors are “beyond ridiculous.”

Angelina Jolie Relying On Kids To Cheer Her Up After Brad Pitt Split — Divorce Details Revealed

Fast forward in time and In Touch has been doubling down, riding the celebrity rumors train full steam ahead. Now, they are running a cover allegedly showing Angelina Jolie’s wedding in Cambodia. The front cover and the way it features Angelina’s wedding dress are designed to give the impression that Angie has already been married. But if you break open the tabloid, In Touch is claiming Angelina is still planning a future 2017 wedding in Battambang, Cambodia.

The latest edition is still alleging that Jolie has “quietly fallen for a wealthy 40-something British philanthropist and businessman, and she’s eager to marry for the fourth time as soon as her divorce from Brad is finalized.” The same “family friend” is supposedly spilling the beans on the movie star’s plans for a small wedding that celebrates the Cambodian culture. Pitt is supposedly not “standing in her way anymore.” The funny part is that no one knows the name of Angelina’s dating partner, his age, or any other major life detail.

In this case, Gossip Cop claims the “tabloid is stepping in it further and further, as the only thing that stinks around here is the magazine’s dreadful reporting.” The real problem is that it’s not merely bad information from an unknown source, Gossip Cop alleges that In Touch “has simply been making it all up” by generating fake news.

What is the truth? After all, there have been secret celebrity marriage ceremonies in the past, including well-known names like Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux, Ryan Gosling, and Eva Mendes. In the end, In Touch and its secret “family friend” stand alone in reporting Angelina Jolie’s wedding plans, while Gossip Cop has a source claiming that the tabloid has “created a soap opera-worthy, but false, narrative.” It seems safe to say this celebrity news is debunked. What do you think?

And Deepak goes back calling me a troll, and a nazi, and a pro India dude. 

And this kind of stuff goes on and on and on...you get the idea.....he ignores information you give him. He picks and chooses what he wants to answer. And he doesnt even answer the logic you give him sometimes. But he wastes his time in name calling, and insluts, and putting you down then. 

So then after a while i get annoyed. And i remind him how things got this bad between us. I type and type and type and type just like i am now. 

And Deepak ignores most of what i typed. 

Many times i write him these long replies where i answer all his points, where i tell him why its wrong for him to insult me and put me down, and why its wrong for him to ignore the information i have as to why i want to make an edit, or whatever it is im bringing up then.....and no matter how much i write....even if i write these long replies to him then....even if i answer every point he brings up....he usually either ignores most of what i wrote down....or....he picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....or.....he just responds back by calling me a troll, or accusing me of being pro nazi or something, or accusing me of ignoring his points (which is so not true cus i respond to pretty much everything he says then), or accusing me of not understanding what he is telling me, or just accusing me of being pro India then (which I am) or just insulting me, or just name calling me, or just putting me down. 

So then after a while i get so annoyed cus he's this a guy here then with me now, and so i start to call him names. I call him a dictator. I call him the ruler of wikiepdia. And I tell him how he ignores my points. 

And then Deepak tells me how i cant call him names, and how i cant throw mud at him, and how im breaking wikipedia rules

So then I ask him how comes its ok for him to name call me and i cant? How come its ok for him to throw mud at me but I cant then? How come its ok for him to break Wikipedia's rules but I can't then? 

And Deepak has no logical answer....or....he won't respond to those questions that I ask him then . Or he just ignores what i ask him, and goes back to accusing me of being a troll, or acting like im a pro nazi or something then , or just insult's me in general then......

So then I get more annoyed and call him thing's like a dictator, which as you can see here with our history, this is how he acts.....isn't it true?.....he ignores most of my points and picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....sometimes he won't even answer you at all.....and sometime's he just insults you then . So it's logical if get annoyed and call him a dicator right?

Wrong....Deepak then holds it against you that your name calling him...and threaten's to block you, or report you, or he just tel",1

2777,"Caitlyn Jenner: Robert Kardashian Believed O.J. Simpson Guilty of Murder

Caitlyn Jenner’s forthcoming memoir, The Secrets of My Life, is billed as a book in which she ""reflects on her past as she looks to her future."" While she touches on a number of topics, such as her Olympic triumph and three failed marriages, the revelation that Robert Kardashian allegedly told her that he believed O.J. Simpson was guilty of killing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman is making waves.

According to Radar Online, which obtained an exclusive copy of the book, Jenner talks about a car ride she took with Kardashian in the 1990s following Simpson's civil trial and claims he said, ""I would've been okay with it if they had gotten him in the first trial."" The implication, as Jenner goes on to explain, ""was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty.""

Even so, as one of the three members of Simpson's defense team, and a good friend of the Hall of Fame football and movie star, Jenner asks herself if Robert Kardashian's decision to continue defending Simpson was his way of getting revenge against his ex-wife Kris Jenner because he knew it would upset her. Kris married Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner in 1991 months after her divorce from Robert Kardashian. Kris Jenner also considered Nicole Brown Simpson one of her best friends.

""I wonder if it was his way of saying to [Kris] what I think she was saying to him when she married me: a big fuck you,"" Jenner reportedly writes.

Jenner reportedly goes on to call Simpson ""the most narcissistic, egocentric, neediest asshole in the world of sports I had ever seen"" and say he got away with ""two savage murders."" According to Radar Online, Jenner also forbade her stepdaughters from saying Simpson's name in the house after Kourtney Kardashian said ""I told you he didn't do it!"" when he was found not guilty by the jury in 1995.

 Removed POV 

I removed undo criticism of Secretary Boutwell and POV. Wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead. The following has been removed from the article.

""""Boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation, shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation.  Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. """"He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception,"""" Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870. """"He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton. By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.""""Henry Adams, """"The Session,"""" North American Review, July, 1870, p. 36.  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends. Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure. His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money. Chicago Times, March 6, 1875.  """"He is an inaccessible man, uninfluenced by fear, favor, affection or hope of reward, and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred,"""" a New England politician wrote his brother. Henry F. French to Benjamin B. French, March 16, 1869, Benjamin B. French Papers, Library of Congress.

""""Boutwell's financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.""""Liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments; but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part, , he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington, remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.''""""

Colonies are not independent states and thus by definition don't have a Head of State, be it a President or a Monarch.

Francois Hollande is not 'President of French Guiana', because French Guiana is a French overseas department, and so on. Again; colonies cannot have a Head of State by definition!

Canada after 1867 of course was not a colony, legally had a monarchy separate from that of the UK, and thus 1867 really should be the cut-off point.

'Monarchs who ruled the country that was the colonial power that colonized Canada' is not the same thing as 'Monarchs of Canada'-including the French monarchs and the UK monarchs prior to 1867 makes as much sense as having a list of the British monarchs prior to 1776 on the page 'List of Presidents of the United States'",0

theJasmineBRAND.com exclusively reports, Usher has allegedly been cast on the upcoming season of Dancing With the Stars. Sources tell us the 38-year-old singer and actor will be on season 24 of ABC's hit dancing competition show.

The producers and network are keeping it top secret, but this is major! They wanted an A-lister and he's one of the biggest names in the industry. Not to mention, Usher is an amazing dancer.

We hear that Usher has already began shooting promos for the show. The network and producers are still working on finalizing other big names for the new season.

Dancing with the Stars is an dance competition TV series that premiered on June 1, 2005, on ABC. The show is the American version of the British television series Strictly Come Dancing. The format of the show consists of a celebrity paired with a professional dancer. Each couple performs predetermined dances and competes against the others for judges' points and audience votes. The couple receiving the lowest combined total of judges' points and audience votes is eliminated each week until only the champion dance pair remains.

What do you think of Usher joining DWTS?

You better believe the royals were out and dressed to the nines to celebrate the beginning of the official season earlier today.

Kate Middleton and Prince William mingled with guests at the lavish daytime affair and smiled for the crowd as they posed for their official photographs.

The Duchess of Cambridge donned a Christopher Kane coat dress and paired it with a sophisticated John Lock and Co. hat that perfectly matched the baby blue satin.

Queen Elizabeth II's Royal Style Through the Years
Nearby, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip hobnobbed with approximately 8,000 lucky party attendees as well and appeared to be in great spirits.

Per the palace, today's bash was quite the event to remember. Almost 27,000 cups of tea were served to those in attendance and around 20,000 tea sandwiches were consumed.

Still hungry? Worry not, there was plenty of dessert to nosh on—specifically, 20,000 slices of cake.
More garden parties are expected on the official royal calendar in between May 23 and June 1, so we'll be seeing fascinators galore in no time flat.

But speaking of fancy royal garb, there's a big event coming up in a few days that's bound to be filled with stunning couture—Pippa Middleton's wedding!

Kate's younger sister is tying the knot on Saturday to James Matthews and several family members are expected to attend.

Looks like it's only a matter of time before we see what they'll all be wearing!

2520,"Has Khloe Kardashian had fillers?

She emphatically denied that she had any work done on her face to her own sisters on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, but now the truth is out.

Khloe Kardashian has admitted that she got facial fillers on the latest episode of her chat show Kocktails With Khloe, but it didn’t work out how she wanted.

The 31-year-old reality star, who has overhauled her image since her split from former NBA star Lamar Odom, revealed that she had a few bits done but didn’t like the results.

“My face was f****d!” she was heard telling her guests on the show.

Talking to plastic surgeon Dr Terry Dubrow, of the TV show Botched on her TV show, Khloe revealed how the look just didn’t work for her and she returned to get the filler “dissolved”.

“It did not work for me. I looked crazy, and I still think the effects are in there - I went to have it all dissolved like three times,” she said.

Khloe insisted that the first time she had the work done was before Lamar’s ‘accident’ in October last year, when he was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel after a wild weekend.

“I did it and then Lamar's accident happened,” Khloe explained, claiming that the result was affected by the athlete’s collapse.

“I was so stressed out the doctor was like, ‘I think it's just too much was happening to your real emotions’,” she said.

Raging about the look, Khloe continued: “My face was so f***ed I had to go and get this whole thing dissolved.

“It was a bummer and now I'm afraid to do it again. And I'm almost like, I swear things are still in my face.”

Khloe previously denied having any fillers, and was seen in the season finale of the family’s reality show telling her own sisters – Kim and Kourtney – that she had not received any treatment when quizzed about her changing look.

In scenes that aired in January, following Kris’ 60 Great Gatsby-themed birthday bash in November, Kim is heard speaking to Khloe on the phone.

“Khloe, I was gonna call you and talk to you last night about this,' Kim said. “Your whole face has changed. Did you do any filler?”

Khloe Kardashian kept her look pale and interesting as she stepped out in LA.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star showcased her enviable curves as she enjoyed an outing with mum Kris Jenner.

Khloe, 31, bared her bra in a see-through white tank top which she teamed with a pair of form-fitting white jeans.

She completed her look with a pair of aviator sunglasses and high-heeled beige suede shoes.

Momager Kris, 60, kept her look simple in a black blazer, jeans and trainers and her toyboy boyfriend Corey Gamble, 35, looked laid-back in a grey tracksuit.

Khloe stepped out after returning from a boozy trip to Napa Valley with her mum and sister Kourtney.

The trio shared hilarious videos of their tipsy exploits on Snapchat as they sampled the alcohol.

From a conversation about ""squirting"", to some sexy dancing from Khloe, and then THAT chant/rap from Kris - we saw quite the show from the family members.

In one video Kris was seen looking ahead as she continuously chanted: ""Oh walkie talkie, Oh wa, oh wa, oh walkie talkie.""

Kourtney shared a snap revealing half drunk glasses of wine with the caption: ""Hungover wine tasting.""

We bet they had sore heads the next day.

At one point, Kris appeared unable to pronounce the word ""Kindle,"" as Khloe corrected her, saying, ""No, a Kendall is your daughter. Kindle.""

Later Khloe couldn't resist poking fun at her sister Kylie, as she used a face distortion app to make her lips huge - joking that it's the ""Kylie Jenner filter"".

Kylie has admitted to having temporary lip fillers, insisting it has helped her confidence.

While he doesn't appear to confirm or deny an affair, her reps said there is ""no truth whatsoever"" to the reports and labeled the situation ""fabricated.""

 Editing of Anthony Hungerford 

Dear Phillip,

               My comments regarding your editing of this site are not hostility, they are upset!
I have only ever place three entries onto Wikipadia, and am the first to acknowledge that I have not made myself fully aware to the protocols of the site. After some 30 years of researching my ancestry, my primary aim was to share the information garnered on those few individuals who have been somewhat prominent in history.

My upset comes from the fact that the editing was not sympathetic. You seem to have just wiped the article and started again. 
The upshot was that instead of leaving the information on the page [after all it has been there for some time-what is the rush to change it?] and asking for clarification, certain aspects just disappeared.

If I understand it correctly, it seems that Wikipedia prefers to quote as a source from the Calendars of State Papers – because a contributor to DNB or ODNB [a secondary source] has seen it, and delete my other quote from the Calendar of State Papers with source reference-because I have seen it personally in a printed book of the Calendars?

Likewise, as I mentioned to you in my email, it was obvious that the authors of both the old DNB and the ODNB did not actually know the origins of Colonel Hungerford-they both speculated. Whereas my later research had got nearer to the truth with my finding details given by Colonel Hungerford to the Ulster Herald, when he arrived in Ireland with his Regiment –which you confirmed with the full reference –

•TABDublin: National Library of Ireland, Genealogical Office: Ms.45, pp.59-60: """"Certificate of Arms to Col. Anthony Hungerford of Marson in Wiltshire and his pedigree. He arrived with his Regiment in D]ublin, April 30, 1647.""""
•TABDublin: National Library of Ireland, Genealogical Office: Ms.45, p.62 Certificate of Arms and cadency to Ensign St. John Hungerford, third brother of and ensign to Col. Anthony Hungerford, May 12, 1647.

I apologise if I have been too harsh in my comments to you, but you must understand that it was basic sourced information, which at the time was not on the internet, that I was seeking to share with Wikipedia readers, not style, rules and display.
I hope you have not finished with your editing. If you require any further clarifications please contact me.

2819,"Weinstein Sues Weinstein Company, Demanding Access to Records

Harvey Weinstein, who was fired by the studio he had helped found after The New York Times revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against him, sued the Weinstein Company on Thursday to demand access to records and emails.

The complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, said Mr. Weinstein needed the materials to defend himself. More than 50 women have come forward in recent weeks to accuse Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment or rape.

“Mr. Weinstein believes that his email account — which is the primary, if not only, account he used during the term of his employment by the company — will contain information exonerating him,” the complaint said.

Mr. Weinstein also wants access to his former email account and other company documents, including his personnel file, to pursue a claim of wrongful termination against the Weinstein Company, according to the complaint. He also wants to pursue legal action against the studio “for mismanagement by leaking confidential company information” — saying that certain news reports about his behavior “could have only come from his personnel file.”

According to the filing, Mr. Weinstein is also seeking the materials to protect his 20 percent ownership stake in the studio by making sure it does not sell itself for a bargain price or make “unjustified settlements” with women who have made allegations against him. “If the board agrees to sell the company for less than it would be worth because of the threat of unsubstantiated or false allegations, Mr. Weinstein will receive less than he should have received,” the complaint said.

Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Weinstein has repeatedly denied “any allegations of nonconsensual sex.”

 Is this map accurate? =

I see some problems with this map:

1- It seems to me that this map only shows the very first homo-sapiens immigrations, not the further ones... 

1a- For example, regarding New Zealand, this map shows the islands being occupied by melanesian peoples that I suppose to be the morioris, while we know the maoris (the ones who come after the morioris and decimated them) were actually Polinesian... 

1b- Europe is shown being occupied by settlers from Anatolia, those were the certainly the Paleo-Europeans... This map does not show the further occupation of Europe by the Indo-Europeans who originated in the Caspian Basin, migrated to Europe and pushed the Paleoeuropeans westards and southwards.

1c- The Brazilian Amerindians are not of Colombian ancestry, they are either of Caribbean origin (the Caribs and Arawaks) or of Paraguayan-Northern-Argentine origin (the Tupi-Guaranis).  The bulk of the Amerindians who were in Brazil about the time of the arrival of the Portuguese were these Tupi-Guaranis.  They came from Paraguay and spread all over the Brazilian coast till the valley of the Amazon River.  When you show a map where Brazilian Amerindians are all coming from Colombia, you are showing a totally contradictory information. 

1d- The Dravidians reached India from Ethiopia to Yemen, from Yemen to Oman, from Oman to Southeast Iran, from Southeast Iran to the Valley of Indus.  What is shown on that map is that the route of the occupation of India by the Indo-Europeans (from Iran through Bactria).

1e- The hipothesis of ancient waves of Paleoeuroepan settling in the eastern coast of North America is ignored, while some geneticists have found evidences of that due to the existance of the Mithocondrial gene """"X"""" (""""Xenia"""") among North-American Native Americans.

1f- This map also seems to ignore the Australoid migrations to South America, some people claim that the Australoids have reached South America before the Mongoloids due to some archeological findings in Brazil.

Anyways, I believe it should be explained that the migrations of the homo-sapiens show on that map are only the first, the early migrations, and the route of their early settling in India should be corrected.  

Also, I would suggest a second map, showing further homo-sapiens migrations (now including the Maori migration from Polinesia, the correct migrations in South America and the settling of the Indo-Europeans in Europe.

66.185.85.80's rant

Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as """"primitive"""" and """"rural"""" (even """"fashist"""") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, """"performed"""" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.
 
Another """"apostle"""" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as """"gusle players"""". 

Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book """"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje"""", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry. 
 
Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  

In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. 

Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. 

The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  """"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West"""" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)

This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)

Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. 

Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre",0
2469,"Rupaul claims Trump touched him inappropriately in the 1990s

In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Rupaul said that Mr Trump ""made a move"" on him during an event celebrating the release of the movie To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar.

The artist was wearing his full drag queen apparel at the time, and he says Trump clearly mistook him for a real woman.

Rupaul says he found Donald Trump attractive before this incident, but that he was shocked by his rudeness and vulgarity.

This allegation from Rupaul adds to the wave of accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior concerning Donald Trump.

Many women have come forward over the last week to denounce the abusive groping and sexual harassment they suffered from Trump over the years.

The New York Times published an article earlier this week, in which Trumps's alleged victims described the mistreatment they suffered.

All these allegations came after Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings from 2005 obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News.

The comments were part of a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show ""Access Hollywood.""

The remarks were captured by a live microphone that Trump did not appear to know was recording their conversation.

He added: ""Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.""

In Rupaul's case, Trump seems to have been disappointed by what he discovered under the dress.

You can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified, that's really not my concern here, since it's a dead letter.  I'm concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal.  If the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice, it's not the first time.  Look at Issei Sagawa.  Part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isn't perfect, and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted, and that guilty people will be acquited, from time to time.  That's the price you pay for having a legal system; in the end someone has to make the decision, and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right.

2437,"Brad Pitt 'lunged at son Maddox when he tried to defend mum Angelina Jolie'

Brad Pitt ""lunged"" at his son Maddox during a flight on a private jet as the teen tried to defend his mum Angelina Jolie, it has been claimed.

The actor - whose wife Angelina filed for divorce and ended their 12-year relationship following the reported incident - is accused of being ""wasted"" and ""screaming"" while in the air with his partner and two of their children.

Now, according to TMZ, it's claimed Brad began arguing with his wife mid-air, and when Maddox jumped up to defend her, he allegedly ""lunged"" at his son.

The site claims ""Angelina jumped in between them to block her husband"", but it's not clear what led to the alleged incident, or if it was even intentional.

But a source told Mirror Celebs: ""These claims are exaggerated and fabricated. It's unfortunate for the whole family that people are insisting on continuing this endless smear campaign against Brad that hurts everyone.

""They are a solid family with two caring parents and a normal share of disagreements. Hopefully people can move on and leave them all alone to work this out.""

Another source added that the FBI is investigating the claims as a jurisdictional issue due to the alleged incident taking place in the air.

The insider added Pitt - who is ""cooperating fully"" with authorities - denies being abusive and wants to do what is best for his children.

As the plane touched down, The Sun reports that the World War Z star allegedly continued his ""rant"" at the 15-year-old before then trying to leave the place in a fuel truck on the tarmac.

The Mirror understands the alleged incident was the tipping point for Jolie to call time on their 12-year relationship.

She split from him the next day.

Angelina Jolie 'willing to co-parent with Brad Pitt but wants full physical custody for now'

According to reports in the US, the 52-year-old is now to be at the centre of a probe by LA County Department of Children and Family Services and has been questioned by investigators along with Jolie.

The children are also expected to be spoken to, and it was claimed authorities had been tipped of anonymously by either someone on the plane or at the airport.

The complaint claims Pitt was drunk at the time.

A day after the actor's alleged meltdown Jolie, 41, broke the news to Pitt she wanted to end their two-year marriage and 12-year romance.

She filed for divorce on Monday stating September 15 was the day they split.

Kim Kardashian is considering a new story line for 2017. Two and a half years after she and Kanye West wed in a multimillion-dollar affair at a 16th century Italian fortress, ""she wants a divorce,"" a Kardashian friend claims in the new issue of Us Weekly. Find out more in the video above and from details below.

Previously married to record producer Damon Thomas and basketball pro Kris Humphries, the 36-year-old isn't rushing to file papers just yet, adds the pal, but she is planning her next steps. ""It will take some time before she can do anything,"" claims the friend, alleging that she's trying to build a case for full custody of kids North, 3, and Saint, 12 months, ""but she doesn't want to stay married.""

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is already distancing herself from the ""Fade"" rapper, 39. Since his November 30 release from UCLA Medical Center's Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital - following a nine-day stay for what his physician Michael Farzam dubbed an episode of ""temporary psychosis"" - West has been receiving outpatient treatment at an L.A.-area rental, multiple sources tell Us.

Kardashian, who has remained with the children at their 9,000-square-foot spread in L.A.'s Bel Air, ""is being very protective and doesn't want Kanye around the kids right now,"" explains the friend.



Still, the Selfish author hasn't entirely shut out West. Hours after the 21-time Grammy winner was released, he attended the balloon-filled ""low-key"" family party Kardashian held for Saint days before his December 5 birthday, says a West insider.



The Kardashian friend says she won't make any decisions until West is fully recovered. Until then, adds the pal, ""she's being a supportive wife."" And the reality star - who has been in self-imposed seclusion since being robbed in Paris October 3 - is happy the musician is on the mend.



""She cares about Kanye and feels relieved he's getting the help he needs,"" continues the friend, ""but she's felt trapped for a while.""

2670,"Analysis | Kanye West and how hip-hop tackles mental health

It's not totally clear what's going on with Kanye West. The rapper, who was filmed delivering onstage rants during recent shows in California, on Monday canceled the remaining 21 dates in his Saint Pablo tour. Hours later, he was reportedly hospitalized for stress and exhaustion.

West spent the night at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for his own safety, the Associated Press reported. Police, without confirming the patient as West, told AP that the officers arrived at a West Hollywood home for a disturbance, and an ambulance took the patient to the hospital to be placed on a psychiatric hold.

Before his hospitalization, West's public breakdowns and stream-of-consciousness speeches have been the subject of jokes and disdain. But recent reports about West's well-being have reopened a conversation about mental health, fame and hip-hop.

The genre has long been characterized by notions of hyper-masculinity that allow little room for vulnerability, and of black and brown men putting forward a tough, adversarial persona. But hip-hop has always had introspective moments (Geto Boys rapped ""My mind is playing tricks on me"" in 1991). In recent years, we've seen more artists opening up about their emotional and mental struggles in the public eye and on albums.

Eminem followed his 2009 album ""Relapse"" with one called ""Recovery,"" after experiencing addiction and depression. DMX has rapped and spoken about suffering from bipolar disorder. In October, Kid Cudi publicly announced on his Facebook page that he checked himself into rehabilitation for his ""depression and suicidal urges,"" writing ""anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as I can remember and I never leave the house because of it.""

This followed angry tweets directed at Drake and West.

After it became public knowledge that Kid Cudi had checked into rehab, Drake released a song with lyrics dissing the rapper and his mental well-being. And despite the backlash against Drake online, the Toronto rapper doubled down.

But much of the response to Kid Cudi was positive. A hashtag, #YouGoodMan, gained momentum as a conversation around masculinity, race and mental health took place on social media.

On Monday, Kid Cudi posted a list of celebrities, artists and fans who actively supported him (including West). ""Thank you for opening your hearts and extending your love and support during a troubling time,"" he wrote.

Kendrick Lamar has also written and spoken about depression and the emotional tumult of being on a world tour while his best friends back home were gunned down. Much of his album ""To Pimp a Butterfly"" centers on survivor's guilt.

[The sound and the fury of Kendrick Lamar at the Kennedy Center]

His lyrics were used for a Kaiser Permanente ad about depression. After a 2015 concert, Lamar saw a woman crying and murmuring ""You saved my life."" She told him she was going to kill herself a year ago, but his music helped her through.

Pharoahe Monch, a beloved independent artist, has been open about dealing with depression, which he has said in interviews was induced by a combination of medications he was taking following hospitalization for his asthma.

""At that time, it wasn't really like it was now, where you have people talking about issues readily in the public,"" he said in a 2014 interview. ""Years ago, it was just, 'Yo, you bugging. Just deal with it.'""

In another interview, he told MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry that it was important for his 2014 album, ""PTSD,"" to include frank and vulnerable lyrics about his struggles and the stigma of depression within the black community.

""Growing up in the community, you look at mental issues as, we're strong, and my parents were hard-working - it's something that's looked at as a weakness so you kind of push through it sometimes without even realizing what the issue might be.""

In ""Losing My Mind,"" Pharoahe Monch raps, ""My family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health/It was more or less an issue for white families with wealth.""

He continues: ""Void, I defected, employed self annoyed/Went independent, enjoyed stealth/Now doctors prescribed sedatives and Prozac.""

West's lyrics, particularly on ""Life of Pablo,"" have caused alarm among some who speculate there's more to them than bombastic exaggeration. For instance, on ""FML,"" he raps about nothing being crazier than when ""he off his Lexapro.""

But West is not just a hip-hop artist; he is a megastar. Aside from music, he works in the fashion industry, and is married to one of the most famous women in the world, one who has built her career off documenting every aspect of her life. West's tweets generate trending hashtags and breathless media coverage.

[What Kanye West said at the VMAs, annotated (full transcript)]

His public behavior over the years has fueled rumors among the public and garnered genuine concern from fans and those close to him. Much of this began after his mother's 2007 death. He has gone on Twitter rants, given rambling interviews and stormed award-show stages - most famously in 2009, when he interrupted Taylor Swift's MTV Video Music Award acceptance speech, turning him into a pariah and punchline.

Rhymefest, who has co-written West tracks for years, announced in February that he had stopped collaborating with the Chicago artist a month earlier after his work on ""Life of Pablo"" was complete. ""His mind and spirit isn't right,"" Rhymefest tweeted. He also tweeted, ""I love my brother. I pray for his health not our entertainment.""

Last week, West brought a Sacramento concert to a halt with an onstage speech that went after, among other things, Jay Z, Beyoncé, Hillary Clinton, MTV and Facebook. When the news of his hospitalization broke Monday night, celebrities and artists immediately offered words of support.

""I want to extend a very special prayer to my big brother, Kanye West,"" Chance the Rapper, a West collaborator, said in the middle of a performance on BBC Radio 1. ""I want to just extend this prayer and extend this love from all the way in Britain. We might come back early to come see this man.""

Producer 9th Wonder tweeted, ""been knowing the brother upwards of 13 years. Mental health is a serious thing, no matter what.""

 Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cheongye Kwan 

Your post at the above AFD on a new martial art bothers me. This was the version at the time, that you based your post on. You posted:

 """"I just read the article, and to be quite honest, feel that it does satisfy Wikipedia's guidelines... it is reliably sourced... Since I believe the notability of the article is satisfied... It now has 11 independent sources. And to refute the argument posed by Wayne, it is determined by the Phillip Rhee source that the martial arts is not localised"""".

Please consider the concerns this post raises. Simple matters like references, notability and noobie basics of AFDs should be routine for any moderately experienced user, and bread-and-butter for any admin. In fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was.. I don't have a word for it. """"Unreal"""" is close.

The """"eleven independent sources"""" that you stated established notability and non-localization at the time, were:
 Three references from 2004 [coates, robinson, shaw], certainly before the topic even existed (!) and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event (!)
 Two references from 1st half 2005 [davies, white], almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topic's notability.
 The promoter's personal page on his local town website, almost certainly self-published [official village website].
 A 2008 casual interview in a non-notable and possibly non-reliable university magazine (apparently) of the promoter's travels to see experts in a different sport, with tangential tiny (< 1 sentence) mention that he'd discussed his new sport with them too. [ the Lau Philip """"LA"""" interview].
 3 entries marked """"Reference and support of , Written Reference"""" [chris, cook, rhee], obviously a request by the founder to a friend/colleague write a letter of support, that was never published anyway and isn't cited so you can't have read it (not that it was even possibly valid evidence).
 A short writeup of a """"local information"""" kind, on the award of the first 4 black belts by the school, in its local paper.

In brief of the 11:
 5 were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less """"sourced"""" material on it or """"substantial"""" coverage (they had precisely zero coverage); 
 3 were claims of personal """"I think  is a great guy"""" letters of support, evidently solicited and/or written on request, with zero evidence of verifiable existence, and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent; 
 1 was self-written
 1 was the briefest of non-mentions in a non-reliable source (pretty much """"I discussed the topic with them"""" in a college magazine interview)
 1 is local press coverage of his courses that's not even """"news for a day""""  or evidence of anything beyond """"a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall"""".

Your assessment of these, at AFD, was:
 It is reliably sourced
{| style=""""border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px"""" width=""""90%""""
| 
 There is barely one reliable source in all of those 11 that the sport even exists in the first place (!) - a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first 4 black belts. Probably via self-promotional input.

Dear Michael, thanks for your comment. I made the comment about the old version of the article almost exactly 3 years ago, see the version at that time: . It said """"Einstein–Cartan theory in theoretical physics extends general relativity, to handle spin angular momentum correctly."""" at the very beginning and the whole article was written in the spirit of the claim that general relativity (without extensions) describes the spin incorrectly. As far as I can read, this is no longer claimed by the article. Einstein-Cartan theory is a historically important extension of general relativity, with some extra fields (torsion), but all the modern evidence indicates that such extra fields don't exist - and they're not needed. If you care about sociology, no research of cosmology or calculations of NASA's experiments or anything of the sort takes the """"torsion field"""" into account because the latter doesn't exist, as far as the existing evidence - theoretical or experimental - can say. Today, it's not an important proposal to extend GR. The new article doesn't make these points too clear but at least it also no longer makes crazy claims throughout the text that general relativity (without torsion) is inconsistent with the spin, or something like that, so I wouldn't protest against the new version. Visually, it surely looks like a well-written article. However, I see some confusion in your comment that does show that the articles doesn't explain the basic points too clearly. Einstein-Cartan theory is not """"just"""" about the tetrads. Tetrads are indeed useful - and in some formal sense necessary - to describe spin in General Relativity. However, using the tetrads formalism is not yet Einstein-Cartan theory. Einstein-Cartan theory assumes that """"torsion"""" may be nonzero - even though it is identically zero in general relativity (which normally uses the metric). One can write GR in terms of tetrads as well - and the torsion is still zero. If that's so, one isn't doing Einstein-Cartan theory.   """,0

The engaged couple are locked in a nasty legal battle with YouTube founder Chad Hurley and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that they're gunning for a huge settlement FOR THEMSELVES and have turned down his offer to donate a sizeable sum to a charity.

The Yeezus rapper and his sex tape star fiancée sued Hurley over claims that his leaked video of their over-the-top engagement threatened their bottom line, and apparently they're not considering settling for anything less than a direct personal payment.

""Chad wanted to make a donation to a charity just to make it go away,"" a source close to the situation exclusively tells Radar

""But Kim and Kanye didn't want the money to go to a charity, they want it to go directly to them.""

Kimye aired the footage of the engagement on Keeping Up With the Kardashians in a two part special, but they are insisting that Hurley's releasing of the video hit them in the wallet.

He will face off with the power couple in court on November 17, Judge Ruth Kwan ruled on Friday, unless they can reach a settlement before then.

Given Kardashian and West's aggressive stance so far, however, that seems unlikely.

On March 14, Kardashian and West filed a motion to quash Hurley's attempt to have the case dismissed under California's anti-SLAPP statute, arguing that they ""generally object to the entirety"" of Hurley's argument and the judge ruled in their favor.

2479,"'It was a long time coming': Heidi Klum ends seven-year marriage over Seal's 'volcanic temper'

Seal and Heidi Klum insisted their split was 'amicable' yesterday despite reports that the supermodel could no longer put up with the Kiss from a Rose singer's volcanic temper.

In a formal statement, the superstar couple finally confirmed rumours swirling around for days that they were breaking up.

According to the US celebrity website TMZ, Klum, 38, demanded a divorce because she was worried about the effect Seal's was having on their children. 



The claim followed reports that she was also fed up with the 48-year-old British singer's 'hard partying.'

There was no suggestion of infidelity, but one source said: 'It was a long time in coming.' 



Heidi father Gunther Klum - who had the German model with wife Ema - today spoke out about the breakdown of the couple's  marriage.

He told US Weekly magazine: 'We are very sad.'

A statement released by the couple today read: 'While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate.

'We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart.

'This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.

'We thank our family, friends, and fans for their kind words of support. And for our children's sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.'



at Seal's beachfront home in Mexico in 2005 , Seal and Klum kept their promise to renew their vows every year on their  anniversary with their close friends and family.

They have three children together – Henry, six, Johan, five, and Lou, two – as well as Miss Klum's daughter Leni, seven, from a previous relationship with Italian businessman Flavio Briatore.

And the tension in their relationship is believed to have started when the pair holidayed with their three children in Ibiza in August.

A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'They were always the couple everybody strived to be but lately it all started to change. Seal seems to have been partying a lot more often than usual.

'When they had their holiday in Ibiza last summer, Seal hit it hard, was out at clubs and with his friends a lot and Heidi was left with their kids trying to enjoy herself. The cracks were appearing and everybody was talking during that trip. He seemed off the rails.'

The insider added: 'They've spent a lot of time apart too on work assignments and that hasn't helped matters.

'Then when Seal came back to the UK to do promotional work for his next album, he seemed sleepy and not with it on shows like Loose Women, when he was very late for his appearance.'

And a source told The Sun today: 'The marriage ended months ago in reality. They rarely saw each other and it wouldn't be unusual for them to go months without spending any real quality time together. Ships that pass in the night would be an overstatement.'

German-born Heidi, 38, is reportedly expected to file papers at Los Angeles' County Superior Court this week citing 'irreconcilable differences'.

Happy: The couple were last seen together on December 26, with Heidi tweeting this picture of them on holiday in Aspen, Colorado

Happier times: Klum and the Crazy crooner share custody of their four children - Leni, 10, Henry, 8, Johan, 7, and Lou, 4 (not pictured)

Seal, 48 – real name Seal Henry Samuel – left a cryptic message posted on his Twitter page on Friday that read: 'The End.' 



The message was attached to a picture that appeared to show the star's forearm bearing an imprint of a set of wings – a possible reference to Miss Klum's role as a Victoria's Secret winged 'Angel' model.

The split paves the way for a multi-million-pound divorce battle between the golden couple. 



Heidi, one of the world's most in-demand models, is reported to have earned more than £12 million in the past year alone.

Seal, who is best known for his Kiss From A Rose single, has sold more than 20 million albums and won three Brit Awards and three Grammys in a career spanning 20 years. 



The couple own a home in Mexico and an £8.4 million mansion in Los Angeles. Yesterday there was no sign of them at the LA house, which is set in an exclusive gated community in Mandeville Canyon, in the Hollywood Hills.

On Wednesday, Seal was in London to pre-record a performance of his new single Backstabbers for Jonathan Ross's ITV chat show, which was broadcast on Saturday night.

Staying professional: Seal was in London last week to pre-record his performance on Jonathan Ross' show, which was broadcast on Saturday night Day job: Heidi has been known in recent years for presenting fashion-based reality show Project Runway Meanwhile, Miss Klum was alone as she attended the Golden Globes awards in Hollywood last Sunday.

 News of the split comes just weeks after the couple posed, apparently happily, for a photo on a skiing holiday in Colorado. On December 26 Miss Klum posted a picture on Twitter of the couple on the slopes in Aspen with the caption, 'Sun and Snow and  @Seal'. Miss Klum divorced her first husband, stylist Ric Pipino after five years together in 2002 and met Seal a year later in 2003. 

 At the time she had just split from  Formula 1 billionaire Briatore.

But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.

""She is not pregnant,"" Aniston's spokesman said on Wednesday, according to the New York Post, adding that it was ""just yet another"" false claim about the actress.

InTouch magazine earlier on Wednesday quoted an unnamed friend of the couple as stating Aniston was pregnant.

""She and Justin are ecstatic. Jen has wanted to have a baby with Justin for years,"" the magazine claimed the friend said.

""Their baby news came at a bad time in her life, too - she just lost her mother, and she and Justin almost broke up. But now this surprise pregnancy has turned the worst of times into the best of times.""

Aniston's mother, Nancy Dow, died on May 25. She had suffered strokes in 2011 and 2012.

The magazine published pictures that it claimed showed Aniston had a ""baby bump"".

Lawrence confessed to the magazine that she suffers an irrational fear.

""If you've ever read the Kurt Vonnegut short story where everyone has to take these pills that make your private parts feel like wet sponges and then nobody can have sex and no one can procreate,"" she explained.

Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest tear up on air talking about her son with dyslexia


Kelly Ripa had a rare moment of vulnerability on Wednesday’s episode of “Live with Kelly and Ryan” that ended with not only her in tears, but her co-host, Ryan Seacrest, as well.

On the October 25 broadcast, Ripa told a story about her youngest son, Joaquin, who started as a freshman in high school in September. The host got very choked up and emotional talking about his struggle with dyslexia and how she recently got some news that he’s on the winning end of that struggle.

 
A Message from American Family Insurance
Get Started with the Right Support
Dream's don't take Saturday's off. Neither do we. With the right support, any dream is possible.
“A lot of you that watch the show know he has dyslexia, so school has always been a very big challenge for us in our household,” she said. “So, I went to his new school for a parent-teacher conference… he’s getting straight A’s. And so I broke down crying in the middle of the parent-teacher conference.”

The star, who Us Weekly notes is a mom to Michael, 20, and Lola, 16, as well, joked that the teachers saw her crying and felt the need to reassure her that they just delivered good news.

“I had to wait three kids to hear these words.”

She went on to explain that her son received word of his grades before she did, but managed to keep them a secret from her so that she’d be surprised when the big moment came. However, when it did, he laughed uncomfortably while she cried tears of joy. While the 47-year-old host fought back her tears on set, Seacrest tried to share some inspiring words with her, but couldn’t handle seeing her cry.

“I see the way you handle career, and most importantly family… and it’s so impressive,” he said of Ripa and her husband, Mark Consuelos. “I am inspired by it, and anybody who knows you and watches you agrees. When my mom cries, it makes me cry, so when you cry, it makes me cry… It’s like a trigger.”

This isn’t the first time that Ripa has gushed publicly over her son’s academic achievements. In June, she posted a photo of her whole family celebrating Joaquin’s graduation from middle school. The family posed together surrounding the youngster in his green cap and gown. Later, they celebrated the big occasion with a star-studded party.

Now it seems that the family has something else to celebrate given Joaquin’s impressive performance in high school so far.

Let me give this an example, let's say I'm talking about the 2004 US Presidential Election. Suppose I say this:

""""Only 60 million Americans (out of the 300 million Americans total) voted to re-elect President Bush."""" 
This sentence is technically true, and it is technically factual, but it is also misleading and unfair to President Bush. The sentence implies that while only 60 million supported the President, the other 240 million didn't vote for him. This is technically true, but it's totally unfair and misleading. The fact is, most American's don't vote, and the majority of those 300 million were """"undecided"""", not """"opposed to Bush"""". And as we know, Bush was, in fact, the most popular candidate. So to say """"60 million out of 300 million total supported Bush"""" is simply very, very misleading even if every word of it happens to be true.

So saying others with different policies are opposed to BSAis the same kind inferrence some were vehemently against.  ;-)

2459,"Beyonce Gets a Surprise Visit From Hillary Clinton

Hillary Clinton recently paid a visit to the Queen ... Bey, that is!

""Beyonce was filming a video and Hillary made a surprise visit to the set"" on Thursday, March 24, in L.A., a source exclusively reveals in the latest issue of Us Weekly.

The insider could not reveal if the Democratic front-runner, 68, scored an on-screen cameo, but a second insider confirms Beyonce, 34, is currently working on an album, complete with music videos. (The album is likely to drop in April.)

By the next morning, Clinton had returned to the campaign trail, setting her sights on the goal she laid out in December.



""I want to be as good a president as Beyonce is a performer,"" she said when asked at an Iowa town hall if she'd rather be Beyonce or president.

No doubt securing a permanent spot in the hive, the presidential hopeful had high praise for the pop star at the event: ""You see her on TV, it's impressive; you see her in person, you're just stunned. Thinking like, 'How does she do that?' Really. I mean, she's singing, she's up and she's down. She's just amazing.""

The admiration is mutual. Last May, Beyonce attended a Hillary Clinton fundraiser event in NYC. Although the mom of Blue Ivy, 4, with husband Jay Z supported Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 presidential races, now she wants her girl Hillary to run the world.

Or were you saying something to the over 300 people who've downloaded this refutation of you're lies?:

http://www.mininova.org/tor/1264745

And so that everyone can see part of it here:

JoshuaZ said:

""""Starfire, as I tried to explain to you Wikipedia cares about reliable sources and verifiability, not truth. Now, if you read that guideline, you may understand why in general AIG and many of the other sources you used are not reliable sources.""""

Hey JoshuaZ the liar, where does Wikipedia's policy say that AnswersInGensis.org is not a reliable source? Where JoshuaZ the vandal and liar? Show us. So you think saying, """"Now"""" is scientific evidence that you are a wise and intelligent teller of the truth or that you know what a reliable and verifiable source is?

JoshuaZ, where does Wikipedia's policy say that the Jacob Sheep Association = a reliable and verifiable source that Jacob Sheep are biologically primitive you hypocrite? Explain that hypocrite who personally attacked Starfire777 using lies.

Show your references JoshuaZ. Saying, """"Now"""" is not a reference that your accusations are true are they? Why can't you make sense Joshua?

Again, where did those verses prophecy anything? Do these look like prophecies JoshuaZ?:

Joshua also said:

""""In this case, they did have sources, so you have even less of an argument.""""

Wrong JoshuaZ. Simply citing sources as you yourself said does not make the source valid. It must be substantiated and verifiable. Why do you conveniently forget that you smug babbling hypocrite?

Your later comments don't merit much of a response, but I wThen he said:

""""ill simply note that accusing people of bigotry, bias, hypocrisy, irrationality and trolling makes my earlier comment about not using """"Darwinist"""" as a slur somewhat irrelevant;""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you said is true is true because you said so. So much for references eh? All you have to do is accuse and it makes you right, right hypocrite? See how you go round and round in circles using circular reasoning?

""""if your earlier comment toed the line, the one above crosses it.""""

Because you said so JoshuaZ, and whatever you say is true because you said so. Science!

""""I suggest you calm down""""

I suggest you not use sarcastic insults like that, ok hypocrite? You're implying that the Starfire777 is ill-tempered merely because he points out that you are hypocrite and uses logic to do so (as well as verifiable references on Answersingenesis.com which you lied about not being reliable and being against Wikipedia's rules to cite), ok liar?

I suggest you also not command a Christian to follow your moral standards over Christ's, over God's. He is a Christian don't ya know? Are you now God to tell him how to feel and think? I suggest you read this verse and take it to heart which millions of Christians know very well so that you learn how not to offend them again:

""""Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil."""" - Ephesians 4:26-27

Last time I checked JoshuaZ, neither your nor Wikipedia's rules superceded God's. 

""""and read the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines while you wait for your block to expire.""""

Oh the old """"you need to read it but I don't"""" and """"you sit and think while your grounded young man"""" insults. What an arrogant, childish hypocrite you are.

I suggest that you stop pretending that whatever you say is true merely because you said it, and again, learn what Starfire777 properly told you to learn.

I'll enhance the list for you:

Reference, evidence, truth, reality, lie, bigot, hypocrite, fallacy, circular reasoning, troll, stalking, harassment, insults, hatred, and love.

And Joshua also said:

""""This is in addition to issues of original research in regard to Biblical prophecies and other issues on the Charles Darwin page.""""

2860,"What Cher Actually Eats in a Day to Stay So Unbelievably Fit

At the Billboard Music Awards, Cher took the stage to perform two of her greatest hits, and we were amazed by how incredible the Billboard Icon Award recipient looks at age 71.

During her set, the singer revealed that she can hold a five-minute plank. ""Icon"" is right.

We did some digging to find out what the singing legend actually does in a day to stay so toned. We want all of her secrets to healthy aging and how she can hold a plank position for five minutes straight (something us mere mortals can't seem to master longer than a minute, err, fine, 30 seconds).

As she told her Twitter followers, she doesn't eat ham or red meat, and focuses on eating veggie alternatives instead.

""I don't like meat and so most of things that I like are healthy for you,"" told Hello! in 2013.

In addition to her vegetarian diet, Cher knows the importance of being healthy, and so, she'll rarely drink and never does drugs.

""Being healthy has always been part of my life. It just works for me,"" she told Closer in 2013. ""There are things I don't like that are unhealthy, like drugs and drinking, so I never got into them to begin with. I smoked cigarettes for a while and I'd have done drugs had I liked them, but they didn't agree with me. I'll only drink three of four times a year too.""

To keep her body in such amazing shape, the singer knows that certain things are better for your, and so, she sticks to those with nutritional benefits.

""I try to avoid foods with a high fat content because they make me sluggish and keep my weight up,"" Cher wrote in her 1991 book, Forever Fit. ""Dairy products are not good for us. I weaned myself from whole milk to nonfat milk — if I'm having milk at all. I think cheese is one of the worst things for the body. It doesn't digest well, and most cheeses are too high in fat and cholesterol.""

It's clearly worked for the 71-year-old star!

Cher admits that sometimes on film sets, she's binged on unhealthy treats from craft services. We can relate!

""I have had some bad binges while making movies. At the end of The Witches of Eastwick, Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon and I really went crazy. We'd go from one of our trailers to the other stuffing ourselves with Pepperidge Farm Cheddar Cheese Goldfish, M&Ms, Cokes and Hershey's Kisses,"" she wrote. ""Then Michelle and I found out we could microwave sweet potatoes in four minutes, and that changed our entire lives. We lived on sweet potatoes, baked potatoes and Caesar salads.""

The source added, ""She thinks he's got what it takes to play both her and her former self, Bruce, and now Rob's throwing his weight behind the project as well."" 

However, Gossip Cop has learned that the report is simply ""not true."" A rep for Rob tells the site that ""he hasn't met with the reality star to discuss a potential biopic."" Caitlyn simply said in an interview that Rob indeed would be a good choice to portray her in a potential film, but the idea hasn't been brought into real life yet. As for the memoir itself, there hasn't been any official announcement whether or not it will be adapted into a movie. 

Caitlyn's 320-page memoir ""The Secret of My Life"" was published last April and chronicled her life as well as revealed some intriguing truths about her past. One of them was the claim that her ex-wife Kris Jenner actually knew about her gender issue during their then-marriage. 

""I tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her,"" wrote Caitlyn. ""This will always be a subject of dispute between Kris and me as to how much she could intuit about my gender issues. She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn...I told her I dressed as a woman, and she knew I did, because I did it several times in front of her after we were married,"" she claimed.

(CNN)Like love, hope springs eternal for Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez fans.

A recent report of the young stars hanging out has definitely given rise to hope among many in their strong fan bases that the former couple could get back together.
Bieber and Gomez were off-and-on for several years before finally calling it quits in 2014.
TMZ recently reported that the singers hung out together, with friends, at Gomez's Studio City, California, home.
Enter the return of #Jelena.
Social media has been filled with fans expressing delight that Bieber, 23, and Gomez, 25, appear to be back on good terms.

For the record, exes can be friends and there has been no word that Gomez has split from her most recent love, singer The Weeknd.
In 2015, Bieber told Complex magazine that he and Gomez had their identities invested in each other when they were a couple (the pair briefly lived together when Bieber was 18.)
""When stuff would happen, I would lose my freakin' mind, and she would lose her mind, and we would fight so hard because we were so invested in each other,"" he said.
The both have had kind things to say about each other over the years, most recently with Gomez complimenting Bieber's performance in June at Ariana Grande's One Love Manchester benefit concert to aid victims of the terrorist attack.

Wikipedia has a very clear and unconcealable agenda [pro-socialists, liberals, greens and gays, determined to vilify and demonize conservatives]. It is a completely biassed source. Its articles on so-called left-wing parties are blatant whitewash while those on so-called right-wing parties are nothing but vilification, most of it based on flimsy third-hand sources and malicious allegations with no basis in fact. Instead of detailing their policies, Wikipedia provides a compendium of prejudice. The frequent denials that you have a point of view or that you are biassed are not at all convincing, particularly since the whole slant is maintained by a policy of rigorous censorship.
POV in Wiki-speak = different POV to us, the Wiki-police.
 I also get the impression that Wikipeople are pretty young. There is no sign of maturity or experience of the real world in their political views.
Under """"conservative"""" we find the definition that these parties are merely in favour of the rich. How naive can you get? I don't know what the term """"fat cat"""" means in the USA but here in Britain it has a very specific meaning i.e. the people employed in the public sector who get salaries of 10-15 times the average. Naturally they are inclined to vote Labour and can also legally donate large sums to that party. Then there are a million more people employed in useless quangos which would be abolished by a right-wing tax-cutting party. Many of them earn two or three times the average wage, and like the fat  cats, they get generous pension-packages too. Added to the votes of the millions of people who live long-term on state benefits, this amounts to a huge vested interest in the socialist programme on the part of people who are neither honest-Joe workers or low-paid.

As if they couldn’t be more perfect already, a new report claims that Anna Faris and Chris Pratt are expanding their adorable family of three into a family of four!


Anna Faris, 40, is pregnant with her second child, reports OK! magazine inside their June 5 issue. “Anna is simply glowing right now and it looks like she has a tiny bump,” a family insider told the mag. This is very exciting news for the Mom actress and her husband, Chris Pratt, 37, who have a 4-year-old son, Jack. The best part? The report claims Jack has been asking for a sibling for a while now! “Their son, Jack, has been begging for a sibling all year,” the family insider share. “It couldn’t come at a better time.” FYI: HollywoodLife.com has reached out to reps for both Chris and Anna regarding this report.

Anna and Chris have been open about their desire to have more children in the past, including their decision to wait after Jack was born nine weeks premature. On top of that, Anna has revealed that she’s considered a “high-risk pregnancy”, which could seriously complicate things. “I wish we didn’t have this biological clock. I’m thinking we have to start talking about [having more kids], looking at all kinds of options,” Anna told Health magazine in 2015. Despite their previous struggles, we’re sure that Chris and Anna are so excited to expand their beautiful family!

While we await confirmation of their baby news, we have to point out that Chris and Anna’s relationship has been nothing short of couple goals. In 2017 alone Chris and Anna have had us swooning over their love a number of times, especially when we found out that the Guardians of the Galaxy star had upgraded his wife’s wedding ring for no other reason than because he felt like it.

2435,"Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Keep Separate Bedrooms

On March 17, first lady Melania Trump, clad in a belted custom Alice Roi coatdress, Gianvito Rossi stilettos and Gucci sunglasses, strode across the White House lawn with her husband, Donald. With the press corps photographers snapping away, the 46-year-old Slovenia-born stunner smiled for the cameras as the billionaire, 70, awkwardly reached for her hand and clutched the tips of her fingers. 



Once the obligatory photo op was complete, she, Donald and their 11-year-old son, Barron, boarded Marine One, POTUS' helicopter, which whisked them away to their Palm Beach, Florida, estate, Mar-a-Lago. Aboard the chopper - and away from the public eye - Melania dropped the act. And Donald's hand. ""Melania,"" a family source alleges in the new issue of Us Weekly, ""does not keep hidden from everyone around her how miserable she is.""

That includes the presi­dent himself. Multiple sources claim that the former fashion model - who's currently living 200 miles away from Washington, D.C., in NYC's Trump Tower while Barron finishes the school year - refuses to share a bed with Donald even on the rare occasions when they sleep in the same city. ""They have separate bedrooms,"" says another Trump insider. ""They never spend the night together - ever."" (A third source says the couple do sleep in the same room but keep separate beds: ""It's very 'royal' of them!"") 



Upset with the former reality star for trapping her in a life she despises, ""Melania wants as little to do with Donald as possible,"" explains the family source. ""She is not interested in Donald, the presidency or anything involving him."" A rep for Melania denies the claims telling Us, ""It's unfortunate that you are going to feature unnamed 'sources' that have provided fictional accounts.""



Since assuming the role of first lady January 20, Melania has kept an extremely limited official schedule. After the inauguration, she mostly stayed in her gilded Fifth Avenue triplex penthouse and didn't set foot in the nation's capital again for 21 days. And the few official appearances she has made were done so begrudgingly. 



Melania escorted Akie Abe, the Japanese prime minister's wife, around Palm Beach in February, but ""only because she was going to be at Mar-a-Lago already,"" according to the family source. ""She refused to do it in Washington.""

2708,"Hillary Clinton to Return to Hollywood for March 24 Fundraising Swing

Hillary Clinton will be back in Los Angeles on March 24 for another fundraising swing, including an event expected to be held at a Hollywood nightclub venue.

Tickets for the event start at $250-per-person, which is a lower price point than many of the events she has held so far in her visits to the region to raise money. The costs rise to $500-per-person, up to $1,000-per-person, according to an invite. Co-hosts who raise $10,000 are invited to a reception with the candidate.

This will be Clinton's eighth fundraising visit to Los Angeles since announcing her presidential bid. She was in L.A. last month for a series of fundraisers, including one at the home of producer Ellen Goldsmith Vein and her husband, MarketShare CEO Jon Vein.

Her chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, last trekked to Los Angeles for fundraisers in October, including an event at the Hollywood nightclub Avalon.

On Wednesday, Katy Perry and Elton John performed at a Radio City Music Hall fundraiser for Clinton in New York. Earlier this week, George Clooney told the Guardian that he planned to also do a fundraiser for Clinton. He hosted a fundraiser at his Studio City home for President Obama's reelection in 2012.

Clinton and Sanders will debate on Sunday in Flint, Mich., with the state's primary on Tuesday.

The March 24 event will be two days after the Arizona and Utah primaries and the Idaho Democratic caucus.

2424,"Kim Kardashian: Nude Cookbook on the Way?!?

Not everyone is a fan of Kim Kardashian and/or the books she pretends to write.

Just the other day, some 74-year old got arrested after vandalizing six copies of Kim's selfie-based memoir.

But we have a pretty strong feeling the only damage anyone will do to the tome discussed will be to spray one's sticky seed all over its page.

If you know what we mean.

According to one of the funniest Radar Online stories we've read in awhile, Kardashian is considering the release of a nude cookbook.

Yes, a nude cookbook. As in, a cookbook that features family recipes AND photos of Kim Kardashian nude.

We challenge anyone out there to come up with a better idea that a book that will enable readers to feed both their actual appetite and their sexual appetite at the same time.

A video report on Radar claims that ""Kim Kardashian has found a new way to line her pockets, even when she doesn't have any,"" adding by way of explanation:

""The reality tart is pitching publishers on the idea of a cookbook in which she poses nude next to her favorite recipes.""

This may seem like a far-fetched concept, but ask yourself two things:

You don't need to tell us the answer to question number-one. We understand if you're a bit embarrassed to admit it.

But the answer to question number-two is revealed below:

Before you dismiss this idea as pure nonsense, allow us to direct your attention to David Thorpe's ""Rude Food.""

In that cookbook, the late photographer conjures images with subtle juxtapositions of attractive and tastefully nude models, along with an astonishing variety of foodstuffs.

Via Amazon, this allowed him ""to create the ultimate in humerous and safe innuendo.""

An anonymous insider tells Radar that Kardashian is convinced ""her concept will succeed because she thinks she's in the best shape of her life after having two children.""

She does look pretty good at the moment, don't you think?

Last week, The National Enquirer also alleged that Kim was considering a naked cookbook, writing that the wife of Kanye West wanted to show the world her ""generous cupcakes.""

By this, we assume the publication meant her ""very large breasts.""

For someone who has been out of the spotlight for months, ever since that scary armed robbery in Paris in early October, this would certainly be a way for Kardashian to get the world talking about her once again.

She could make the talk show rounds.

She could gain new social media followers.

She could recapture all the attention lost to sister Kylie Jenner.

We really don't see any drawbacks.

Moreover, come on... would this really be the most ridiculous idea for a book from a member of the Kardashian-Jenner family?

Considering the following releases, all of which are 100% real, it may actually be the best.

2853,"The new directions of One Direction: what do the solo projects tell us?

This morning, One Direction’s Liam Payne dropped Stripped Down, his debut single, which can best be described as something that certainly exists.

That is, unfortunately, the nicest thing there is to say about the track – particularly when compared to the solo work of Payne’s contemporaries Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson. Over the past year, the four seemed to have called dibs on certain sounds and musical influences, leaving Liam to try and marry the worlds of Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber, to no avail.

But we’ll get to that in a second.

Here’s who it seems the boys of 1D are modelling themselves after. Whether they’re succeeding is another thing entirely.

Since he quit the band long before the boys called a hiatus, it’s not surprising that the singer’s debut (Mind of Mine, released in March 2016) seemed to dramatically strive to establish itself as the musical antithesis of One Direction. Between interviews that saw Zayn slagging off the band and his aesthetic rebrand that saw him secure a collaboration with Donatella Versace, Malik seemed keen to distance himself from the artist he used to be in the most dramatic sense.

Which explains why he took the Abel Tesfaye road of singing about sex, drugs, and a combination of the two. But where the Weeknd took years to earn mainstream recognition (and worked his way through the industry), Zayn’s fanbase was already built in – which is why his rejection of One Direction seemed particularly harsh. So while Malik is a smart, talented, and multi-dimensional person, his debut lacked the authenticity that defines his fellow R&B artists. Not that he can’t come back from that: having spent the past year opening up about his anxiety and keeping his head down, he could emerge for his sophomore effort as a grown-ass man, aware that the best artists are the sum of all parts – boy bands and all.

With Harry, it’s a toss-up between Bowie and Jagger and even Robbie Williams – particularly when you consider the sweeping nature of Styles’ first single, Sign of the Times. (Enter: Millennium.) But thanks to tracks including Carolina, Woman, and even Kiwi, the future Dunkirk star seems to have modelled his full-length debut after the expansive nature of Jagger and co – at least if you take into account how varied the Rolling Stones discography gets after leaping away from garage rock.

Which is something Styles seems to have emulated and recognized, from his stage presence (which he showed off on James Corden’s Late Late Show all week) to his sense of fashion to the way his album reads like a generous tribute to British rock. No two songs are the same, nor are two tempos. Like Jagger, the singer sings primarily about women, his complicated relationship with them, and the experiences that come with being a young man. What will be interesting is whether he reinvents himself similarly as his career continues – dance moves and all.

Is this a stretch? Absolutely. But because Just Hold On saw Louis collaborate with Steve Aoki and do his own singing, it seemed the 1D alum was channeling 2017-era Harris (who’s been singing his own songs) while simultaneously maintaining the DJ’s long legacy of working with big names.

It’s still a generous likening, especially since Louis has only delivered one track with no announcement of a forthcoming full-length. But that could also be a strategy: where his compadres are actively working the circuit, Tomlinson seems content to drop a banger every so often, leaving fans to thirst after him, instead of vice versa. His longevity, however, will depend on whether he gets behind the production board or begins working the DJ booth. Because as great as Calvin’s Harris’ vocals are, I don’t think any of us need entire albums of them.

Here is a thing none of us were prepared for. Where Our Town seemed to solidify Horan as the next Shawn Mendes or Ed Sheeran, Slow Hands was on Bieber-circa-Girlfriend levels of catchy, thanks especially to a slowed-down, seductive beat.

Like Bieber via 2012’s Believe, Slow Hands reintroduced Horan to his fans as an adult. But where Zayn used shock tactics to differentiate himself from his past, Niall borrowed from the pages of Bieber’s book, and used his songwriting to prove he wasn’t just some dude with an acoustic guitar. He could sing well, he could creatively adapt for a grown-up solo venture, and he still cherished his existing fan base and the legacy of his former self. Which Justin did, once upon a time, too: while Bieber leapt from child prodigy to rebel without a cause, his musical evolution never really faltered, and his career was kept afloat by the legacy he refused to condemn or distance himself from. So if Niall considers himself another Bieber, that would be brilliant: he would arguably be setting himself up for even bigger and better success, fortunately too old to relive Justin’s 2013 ventures.

I ... don’t know, you guys. I mean, you can see what Liam wanted to do: he wanted to grow up musically, borrowing from the gospel of Zayn by simultaneously throwing shade at One Direction while singing about sex and parties. The problem is, Strip That Down is even less believable – partially because Zayn has been candid about his partying and personal turbulence (where Liam is now a father) and because Zayn only ever dissed 1D in interviews, not in his actual music.

However, Strip That Down is largely a thirst trap, appealing to a tired brand of heteronormativity through Liam’s references to “girl”, whoever she may be. (Because my dudes, he’s certainly not speaking to Cheryl that way.)

You can see the way he takes the Ed Sheeran approach to vocals, but loses the heart by bragging about how many women are hanging off him, and you can also hear the way he’s using the Nick Jonas approach to post-band life by adopting slick beats while peacocking. The thing is, Sheeran and Jonas have both mastered their art by making songs seem sincere or as part of an in-joke with their audiences – they’re not delivered on a platform built to broadcast their own greatness.

So here’s hoping that Liam’s next single features more of what he’s actually good at: singing. Because while you know he’s thinking of himself as a cross between Sheeran and Jonas, he’s coming off as a salty brat who has no reason to complain about anything.

2667,"Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez are dating, and the rumors are coming in hot

Jennifer Lopez and recently retired baseball hero Alex Rodriguez are dating, according to reports that have been bubbling up all week.

The rumors are all over the place: It's been going on for ""a few months,"" and they were just together in Los Angeles, a source told Page Six on Wednesday evening.

""They are really into each other because they have so much in common - from their Latin roots, to their love of New York and their kids,"" the source said.

However, a People source said Wednesday night that Lopez and Rodriguez have been dating for only ""a few weeks.""

""For now, it's just fun. She is single and enjoys dating,"" said that source, who described Lopez as ""excited.""

The actress-singer-dancer, 47, and the newly full-time Fox Sports broadcaster, 41, are said to be headed for a ""romantic"" vacation in the Bahamas soon with another couple, the Terez Owens sports-gossip blog reported Monday.

""He was with her in Vegas during this latest leg of her Planet Hollywood Vegas show,"" LoveBScott.com reported Wednesday. ""They were all coupled up behind the scenes, not public, but absolutely not hiding their relationship around close friends and family. It is definitely for real.""

Rodriguez, who played his final Major League Baseball game in August, took a full-time analyst job Tuesday with Fox Sports, where he previously had been killing it as a guest host teamed with Pete Rose.

Of course, Lopez's outings with Drake had dating rumors swirling earlier this year too, though she put the kibosh on that for real Monday night, telling Trevor Noah , ""Let me clear this up: I am not with Drake.""

Rodriguez and Lopez each have two kids from previous relationships. His daughters are 8 and 12; her twin son and daughter recently turned 9. A-Rod was married once, while JLo is a three-time divorcee.

Say it ain't so!

According to In Touch Weekly, Julia Roberts and Danny Moder's nearly 15-year marriage is on the rocks — and the Hollywood couple may sadly be headed for a divorce.

""They’ve been fighting over things from his work schedule to her control issues to how to raise their kids,"" an insider recently told the magazine, adding Danny, 48, is now basically living in the pair's Malibu guest house away from Julia.



""The problems keep piling up,"" the family friend continued. ""I don’t know how much more this marriage can withstand.""

The 49-year-old actress and Danny tied the knot in July 2002 and are parents to three kids: nine-year-old son Henry and 12-year-old twins Hazel and Phinnaeus.

The source additionally revealed that Julia — who turns 50 in October — has been excessively flirting with younger men and Danny can't stand it. Late last year, the Pretty Woman star put on an embarrassing display while chatting with pro soccer players at a Manchester United Red Devils game.



""They were given VIP treatment, met the players and went on the field,"" the insider revealed. ""But to Danny’s shock, Julia morphed into the ultimate fangirl when she met Man U midfielders Paul Pogba and Ander Herrera.""

""Danny dutifully took photos of Julia’s amorous display, but was completely unnerved by her actions. He was red-faced with humiliation,"" the friend continued.



“[A few months later], she became incredibly smitten with Real Madrid star Sergio Ramos when she and the family were in Spain for another world-class soccer contest between Real and Barcelona,"" the source said.

""Once again, Danny looked on resentfully as she fawned all over the athletes. He was seething by the time Julia was done with another embarrassing photo session,"" the insider told In Touch.

So are Danny and Julia really headed for a split? Only time will tell!

2549,"Social Media Addicted Kim Kardashian Slammed For Ignoring No-Phone Rule At Serena Williams’ Wedding!

An insider told us that a babysitter followed the reality TV star to make sure she respected the rules. Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian’s wedding was one to remember for sure, and Kim Kardashian was also there. But as we’ve learned, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians celeb has trouble staying away from social media for too long.

One source present at the Beauty and the Beast themed ceremony revealed that Kanye’s wife was reprimanded not once but twice for breaking the tennis champion’s no-phone rule.

What’s more, Serena apparently hired a ‘babysitter’ who was to follow Kim around the venue and stop her from taking any selfies.

‘Everyone was worried that Kim would take pictures and ruin the exclusive with Vogue,’ the insider explained.

As fans of the sportswoman may already know, Williams and Ohanian made sure to invite Vogue editor Anna Wintour at the wedding as one of the honor guests.

Of course, the ultimate goal was to keep all of the pictures away from the press so they could give Vogue the exclusive rights to publish them later.

Kim has broken the no-phone rule before while at Wintour’s MET gala.

2409,"Brad Pitt Texts Jennifer Aniston Nonstop: Seeks Intense Emotional Support After Angelina Jolie Divorce! | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have reportedly gotten back in touch through texting, even though sources from both sides are falling over themselves to clarify that it's 'just texting' and not anything more serious.

Oh, Jen. She's probably so happy inside, even though she would never admit it for fear of coming across as petty. Think about it – this is the same man who humiliated her by dumping her for another woman, and now he's the single one while she's happily (or seemingly happily) married. AND he's texting her! It's all her dreams coming true.

Anyway, sources claim that Jennifer and Brad have been casually texting over the past few days, and Brad has been discussing how difficult the divorce has been for him. Apparently, Jennifer has been helping him through this, which is a little suspicious. Being magnanimous, fine, but offering support and advice to an ex-husband that you spent more than a decade getting over? Um... no.

It's been several months since Angelina Jolie filed for divorce and took their kids with her, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Brad Pitt has been having a tough time since then. He's withdrawn from the spotlight, and we probably wouldn't have seen or heard from him at all if it were not for the fact that he produced Moonlight, one of the most visible films on this year's awards circuit and the eventual winner of this year's Best Picture Oscar.

Regardless, for whatever reasons, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are back in touch – and how does Angelina Jolie feel about this? Well, apparently, not very happy. Again, not much of a surprise. Angelina may have been the one to call it quits, but that doesn't mean that she's over her ex-husband, the same way he's not over her.

She didn't leave because she fell out of love with him, she left because of his 'issues', whatever those issues were. And now, to hear that he's talking with his ex-wife, the woman that he left for her? Let's just say – if Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie weren't already broken up, that might have done the trick.

What do you guys think of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston texting again, and do you think Angelina Jolie is jealous about it? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

2428,"Are Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal Dating Again?

There are reports that Taylor Swiftis trying to rekindle her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal. OK! Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.

The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.

The source said, ""Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn't ready for a serious relationship, but now she's showing Jake how much she's matured. She's excited to see where things go.""

In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.

An unidentified source told Star magazine that, ""He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor's new number. They've kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""

This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.

""This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex's and starts talking about how he's heard we're going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together - just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, 'This is what we're writing,'"" she once revealed to GMA.

The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""

In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.

Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.

Do you think Taylor should get back together with Jake? Tell us in the comments.

How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

Tom Cruise politely responded to a question about daughter Suri at his Mummy premiere last night, but didn't appear comfortable enough talking about her to elaborate on the answer.

The 54-year-old actor was asked whether he thought 11-year-old Suri might have the acting gene just like him and mum Katie Holmes.

""You never know, you never know,"" he replied awkwardly to The Sydney Herald..



He then turned the subject back onto himself, before continuing: ""For me, I just love making movies. I have been doing it my whole life. I am shooting Mission Impossible right now.

""I just left from France to be here today and while I was doing it, I was in post production on another film, one I have coming out in August called American Made and I am also prepping two other films, it's just what I do.""

While the Mission Impossible star prefers to keep his family life private, which is fair enough, there were reports last year that he hadn't seen Suri for three years.

Katie and Tom divorced in June 2012, with US Weekly claiming that the last time he saw Suri was when they were pictured at Disney's Typhoon Lagoon Water Park in Florida three years ago.

They commented: ""Tom hasn't seen or even called Suri in about three years. Tom has no relationship with Suri. Tom has no relationship with Suri.""



However, neither Tom nor Katie responded to the speculation.

Katie is Suri's primary carer, with the 38-year-old Dawson's Creek star recently sharing pictures from her daughter's birthday on Instagram.

She also posted a throwback photo of Suri and added the caption: ""My light"".

having had a third opnion by someone with more knowldge of the subject, what t-mans posted is factually correct even if as pointed out by the editor in need of some copy-editing  

some copy-editing later
an editor came up with this:

Alongside Clayface, a resurrected one-off concept from 1940 (there are 6 resurrections in total).

In the 1970s, new Batman villains begin to adopt influences from horror and realistic crime fiction (secret agent films), first with Man-Bat (who unlike Batman, is a real human/animal hybrid) and the later with the master criminal Ra's Al Ghul and his daughter Talia, the first villains to learn Batman's identity. (very ok!!!)

The less famous villan, but often equally charismatic Ventriloquist, KGBeast, Black Mask and Killer Croc emerged iduring the 1980s.

More common criminals, such as the Gotham mob leader Carmine Falcone were also added to the villain lineup

The 1990s were notorious for the introduction of the Joker's assistant, Harley Quinn who appeard exclusivley in the cartoon series.

Bane, was the only villain to physically humble Batman. Hush and a new Red Hood are the most famous inductees in the 2000s, due to their connections to Batman's past

2874,"Kris Jenner Is Concerned for Future Generations of Kardashians

Kris Jenner, mother of six and grandmother to six more, is a busy matriarch. Since the start of her family’s reality show in 2007, it’s clear that she’s been keeping one eye trained on the reality-TV circus and the other on how that circus affects her family. During a new reality-TV roundtable with The Hollywood Reporter, Jenner said she worries about how her six grandchildren will be affected by the family business.

“It’s my grandchildren who I worry about because I have six of them; the oldest just turned 7, and my youngest is 6 months old, and they don’t have a choice,” she said. “And I worry, I do, because it is such a bullying environment.”

Jenner said her daughters’ “thick skin” has helped propel them forward despite the maddening trolls of reality TV. These are, after all, the sisters whose public fights, tears, and meme-worthy breakdowns made them one of the genre’s biggest success stories. They chose a public life, though. Their children did not, but they’re still placed in front of the cameras—hence Jenner’s fears about what she started.

Her grandkids, Mason, Penelope, and Reign Disick, North and Saint West, and Dream Kardashian, have become celebrities themselves by birthright alone. Anyone recall North’s debut diva moment, as she rolled through the Paris airport on a Frozen-themed suitcase, wearing a Yeezus Tour jacket?

During the roundtable, Jenner leaned on her original philosophy for the show (never to hold back) as she talked about how her life as a reality star has evolved.

“We decided as a family that if we’re going to do this, we would just show everything. And one of the best decisions I made not only as a producer of the show, but as one of the stars of the show, was to say, ‘We’re not going to remove anything.’ With that philosophy, I told the kids, ‘Don’t get on the Internet.’ Now it’s so amplified . . . you expect it now from the trolls.”

She added that Kim Kardashian West “leads the pack” as the “queen of thick skin,” modeling for everyone else how to face the Internet and other critics alike.

As they grow, the Kardashian grandchildren will have a whole new host of technologies to battle (imagine trolls with drones), but North just might have inherited the thick-skinned genes to handle it. She already knows how to tell the paparazzi to back off.

Khloe Kardashian has no time for haters.

Following news that Kardashian family friend O.J. Simpson was granted parole on Thursday, users began flooding the reality star's social media accounts with messages of hate, bringing back to light the speculation that the former NFL star is her real father.

Cyber bullies didn't hold back, writing things like, ""OJ runnin' right back into ya life #DaddysHome,"" ""You're definitely OJ Simpson's child"" and ""Stop taking selfies and go see your dad!""

Others had her back, reminding the haters how hurtful it was to leave comments like this as her actual father, Robert Kardashian, who was one of Simpson's defense attorneys in the infamous 1995 murder trial, died in 2003. Simpson was found not guilty for the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman.

""The comments under Khloe's picture is sick,"" a fan on Twitter wrote. ""I'm so hurt she needs to deal with this all. Robert Kardashian is her father, leave her in peace.""

Khloe responded to the tweet, writing, ""People are a**holes but I don't care lol I focus on the good.""

Another fan chimed in and said, ""People are legit f**ked and it makes me angry.""

""They are all f**ked lol such as**oles,"" Khloe wrote. ""Hehe oh well.... I'm happy and they hatin.""

As ET previously reported, Simpson was granted parole while at the Lovelock Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nevada, where he appeared live via video teleconference in front of the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners in Carson City. The decision was handed down by parole commissioners Connie S. Bisbee, Tony Corda, Adam Endel and Susan Jackson, the same four board members who granted Simpson parole at his July 2013 hearing on his kidnapping, robbery and burglary charges.

During his parole hearing, Simpson said he has lived a largely conflict-free life, and that he had done ""his time.""

""I've always been a giving guy, even on the streets, people have always come up to me,"" Simpson said, stressing that he's continually served as a peacekeeper in jail among other inmates.

2807,"Kris Jenner Just Broke Her Silence On Kylie's Pregnancy

If you didn't already know that Kylie Jenner is pregnant, well, let me be the first to tell you: Kylie Jenner is pregnant!

She's expecting a child with rapper Travis Scott, whom she's been dating since April.
When the news broke yesterday, the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan stayed silent about it — including Mama Kris.

E!
But this morning, while attending an event at Milan Fashion week, Kris gave an interview with The Cut — and she (somewhat reluctantly) broke her silence.

Tristan Fewings / Getty Images
""Did you know the news was going to break about Kylie?"" the interviewer asked.

""I just woke up this morning,"" Kris replied. ""She’s not confirmed anything. I think it’s kind of wild that everyone is just assuming that that’s just happening.""

While Kris did not confirm the news herself, she also didn't deny it, adding:
Something happens every single day. You never know what is going to break at any moment.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.
 
While Kylie hasn't released an official statement on the matter, multiple outlets are reporting the news. TMZ was the first to break the story, and cited multiple sources.

A source with knowledge of the situation also confirmed the pregnancy to BuzzFeed.

And Kylie's Instagram has featured some older pics as of late. Like this one, posted two days ago, is actually from last year:

Well, we look forward to hearing what Kylie has to say about all this. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2429,"Taylor Swift 'files documents to launch streaming service'

Taylor Swift has reportedly filed documents to launch her own streaming service in the wake of her backlash against Apple Music and Spotify.

The Shake It Off hitmaker, who hit out at streaming services for offering her music for free in 2015, is said to have made moves to brand a website 'featuring non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings'.

TMZ report that the website will be dubbed 'Swifties' and will launch a line of music products complete with guitars, picks, straps and drumsticks atop organising educational trips, online courses and retreats.

Taylor's now-famous feud with streaming services saw her reveal she will not allow her latest album on Apple Music to protest its 'shocking' lack of artist compensation during a free trial period.

The move by Taylor, who is one of the most outspoken critics of Spotify, delivered an early blow to Apple's bid to dominate the booming sector two years ago.

She said that the tech giant, which launched Apple Music in June 2015, will not pay for songs streamed during a free three-month trial period for new subscribers.

'I find it to be shocking, disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company,' she wrote in a posting on Tumblr.

Taylor - whose '1989' was the top-selling US album in 2014 and remained high on the charts - insisted that she was speaking for all artists and not just herself.

'This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt.

'This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field...but will not get paid for a quarter of a year's worth of plays on his or her songs.

'These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much.'

'Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done,' she continued.

'I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.

'But I say to Apple with all due respect, it's not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don't ask you for free iPhones. Please don't ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.'

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Taylor for comment.

Before you go, we thought you'd like these...

Is Jennifer Aniston ready to become a mommy?

Much to the dismay of fans everywhere, rumors that the 47-year-old actress is getting ready to adopt a child of her own after becoming closely involved with two orphanages in Mexico have been quickly destroyed.

Aniston prompted speculation after reportedly becoming a regular visitor at Casa Hogar Sion and Casa Hogar de Los Ninos orphanages in Tijuana, Mexico.

The former ""Friends"" star tied the knot with actor Justin Theroux in a secret ceremony in 2015. Many claims have surfaced about a possible bun in the oven since then, but the couple has been quick to deny the claims.

""For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up,"" she wrote in a strongly worded essay back in July.

She revealed to Marie Claire last week that she wrote the op-ed because she refused to ""be whittled down to a sad, childless human.""

Pregnancy talks have followed the celebrity throughout her career, especially after some speculated her resistance to having kids destroyed her five-year marriage with Brad Pitt.

And it seems like she's not fazed by the swirling rumors -- she was recently spotted with her beau in Berlin packing on some major PDA.

Did Beyonce just have her twins? Rumors have been flying that Queen Bey gave birth to a precious boy and adorable girl on Saturday, May 20, according to an exciting new report!

Beyonce and her hubby Jay-Z, 47, already have a daughter Blue Ivy, 5, together so now they’re a sweet family of five!

Fans speculated that Queen Bey could have been further along than originally suspected after she shared some precious bump photos in April. Experts thought she was around four months along when she announced her amazing news in February, but she looked like she was about to pop just three months later! Everyone began to wonder if she could have the babies sometime before her estimated July due date.


Bey and Jay took advantage of their last few months as parents of one with a romantic trip to the Grand Canyon in April. The couple looked like they were in absolute bliss as they celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary together! Beyonce posted a ton of spectacular pictures and even caption an especially sweet one of herself with Jay with a lyric from her own song “Die With You.” ““No I don’t really need these legs if I ain’t walking by your side…..and I don’t really need to be if I can’t be with you,” she wrote.

 Request regarding current RfAr/Clarification 

There is an open Request for Clarification regarding a sanction decided at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Abd-William M. Connolley, see live link, or permanent link.

 is the only arbitrator to comment there so far. I agree with him, and, unless other arbitrators wish to address the issues raised, I support the close of this request with no finding or clarification. My reason for this: it is apparent that any useful clarification would require more discussion than can be accomplished at RfAr/Clarification, and that I was blocked while this request was pending, for comments made in the request itself, is an additional impediment.

There is no need for extra debate or argument. I have stated that I am willing to accept a tighter restriction than the way in which I interpreted the sanction, pending clarification by ArbComm. So the status quo is that the restriction is tight, though not necessarily as tight as defined by the administrator who blocked me. I do not consider myself restricted from what the sanction explicitly permits, and I'd argue that he did so consider. I accepted Sandstein's decision (""""clarification"""") as a neutral administrator, pending ArbComm review, not Future Perfect's who was already involved, and I had already claimed that he was involved in dispute with me.

I will continue to respect Sandstein's tightening as standing and binding on me, and will interpret this very narrowly but as originally stated, and it did permit legitimate comment before ArbComm, when I am an originating party, as is normal. Normally, I can, having filed, respond there to comments from other editors, also made there, which is what I did. ArbComm specifically allowed me to originate a case, and if I'm clearly involved as well, I see nothing in the sanction which requires me to avoid it.

I will not use this as a loophole to drive trucks through carrying my opinion about disputes between other editors, and I will avoid, in such a filing, if it happens, unnecessary mention of disputes between other editors. Obviously, if I file a case claiming involved use of tools by an admin, I will present evidence of involvement and existing disputes or other reason that recusal would have been required, which would only mention other disputes peripherally, and which will not be an attempt to resolve those other issues.

I hope that there is more clerk attention to an actual RfAr than there has been to the existing RfAr/Clarification, which, as it stands, includes an illegitimate edit by someone other than me to the material I filed. It's been pointed out by , with clerk attention requested, and nothing was done. Nevertheless, if the request is closed without action, it's moot. The real point here is that if clerks were following filings before ArbComm, surely this would have been noticed and reverted or moved, and possibly the editor warned.   """,0
2674,"Sorry, Paris Hilton Never Actually Ordered Kim K Around On 'The Simple Life'

The Internet loves to remind itself of Kim Kardashian's relatively humble beginnings. That is, before she became the world's most famous reality star, she spent her days toiling as an assistant to then-BFF Paris Hilton.

What's more, the Internet loves to relive a few moments of Hilton being particularly unkind to Kardashian as she allegedly orders her around. Those moments were forever captured on camera for episodes of ""The Simple Life"" back in the mid-2000s.

Screengrabs from these episodes have become very popular, but there's just one problem -- the captions are completely fake and your favorite Kim Kardashian meme is a fraud.

Here's the conversation that actually took place on the episode:

Yep, that was a scene about giving a dog a pregnancy test.

But moving on, this gif with a caption of Hilton telling Kardashian to organize her closet is again also 100 percent fake.

And while it may be fake, it may actually be better than the real conversation that was had in Paris' closet that day:

Paris: I love this closet, it's so good. 

 Kim: What's going on with this?

 Paris: That's my 'If I ever go to India' outfit.

 Kim: Really?

 Paris: Yes.

 Kim: Are you planning on going?

 Paris: Yes, but don't you have to, like, cover up everything?

 Kim: You're not allowed to show any of your hair. It's like a law. 

 Paris: Are you allowed to have blond hair? If you travel there do you really have to do this?

 Kim: I think so, or you'll get like shot or something. 

 Paris: That's hot.

It's difficult to pinpoint exactly where these screengrabs with fake captions originated, but multiple news outlets just assumed they were real, and the myth of Hilton as a demanding boss who desperately needed her closet organized only continued to grow. However, after learning what Hilton and Kardashian were really discussing at the time, the two might now be wishing the hotel heiress was actually ordering the future reality star to clean her closet.

So, if you want these memes to live on, use the right captions:

Angelina Jolie Embraces Her Inner-Witch, and Inner-Mom

The news that Angelina Jolie's daughter, 4-year-old Vivienne, will appear with her mother in the live-action movie Maleficent, in which Jolie plays the titular sorceress, has already sparked a predictable array of nepotism jokes. And while I'm sure Vivienne got a massive leg-up because of who her parents are, there's also something awfully fun about seeing Jolie play both with her public image as a practitioner of the dark arts, and her private life as a mom.



For more than a decade, Jolie has been saddled with a witchy reputation, one that wasn't based in Hollywood diva behavior but in small acts that assumed great proportions in the public mind. When she married co-star Jonny Lee Miller, Jolie took her vows in a T-shirt emblazoned with his name written in her own blood. And after she and actor Billy Bob Thornton wed, they famously wore matching necklaces with vials of each other's blood. Gossips tutted about a smooch Jolie laid on her brother at the Academy Awards, and the actress ran through the list of tabloid-sating provocations, dating actress Jenny Shimizu, discussing her history of self-mutilation comfortably in public, and talking about BDSM with a fluency that would set E.L. James a-scribbling.



Taken together, all of the above combined to paint a portrait of a powerfully alluring woman with deep uncertainties about herself and her choices. When Brad Pitt divorced Jennifer Anniston to be with Jolie, now his fiancee after seven years and five children together, the romance provided a narrative that seemed to solidify Jolie's public image. In the pages of gossip rags she was an enchantress, a creature of blood and sex, qualities never entirely erased by her eventual transformation into mother of three children by Pitt and three others by adoption.

Which is why it's so awesome that Jolie is starring in a children's movies as a witch, rather than as a princess or a warrior. Witches may bear the weight of public disapproval, but the hero often needs them at the beginning of the journey, and the adventure often involves the hero learning to see the world with some of the wisdom and disappointment that inform the witch's perspective. But even in movies with bad-ass princesses like Brave's Merida, the witch who gets consulted halfway through the story is a wizened old crone with a fondness for whittling. Outside the sympathetic librettos of Stephen Sondheim, witches don't really even get much of a chance to compete for the title of hero.

So I've loved seeing Jolie don horns and fly around in harnesses in set photos from Maleficent. And I'm even more excited that she'll be bringing her daughter to work with her. The movie's a reminder that we should consider sympathizing with the witches a little bit more frequently. And Vivienne's appearance is a joke on all the people—including Jolie's father, Jon Voight— who suggested Jolie was an unfit mother. Witches don't just lock adorable blonde princesses in towers. Sometimes, they give birth to them.

2866,"Angelina Jolie on Cambodia 'awakening'

Angelina Jolie has spoken about how Cambodia was her ""awakening"", as she premiered her new film in the country.

The actress was speaking exclusively to the BBC before the screening of First They Killed My Father, a true-life account of the Khmer Rouge genocide through the eyes of a child.

She said she hoped the film, which she directed, would help Cambodians to speak more openly about the trauma of the period.

Jolie, now a UN refugee agency special envoy, first visited Cambodia for the filming of 2001 hit Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.

She later adopted Maddox, her oldest son, from Cambodia.

""I came to this country and I fell in love with its people and learned its history, and in doing so learned, how little I actually knew about the world,"" she told the BBC's Yalda Hakim.

""This country, for me was my awakening.

""I'll always be very grateful to this country. I don't think I ever could give back as much as this country has given me.""

First They Killed My Father is based on a book of the same name by Loung Ung.

Ms Ung was five when she and her family were forced to leave their home in the capital, Phnom Penh, by the Khmer Rouge, the regime which ran the country between 1975 and 1979, under Pol Pot.

It is estimated that about two million people, around a quarter of the population, were either murdered by the regime or died from starvation and overwork.

""I thought that this war that happened 40 years ago, and what happened to these people, was not properly understood,"" said Jolie.

The film is predominantly in the local Khmer language, and Jolie said that while she wanted the wider world to better understand events in Cambodia she hoped it would have an impact domestically too.

""I hope it helps the country speak more,"" she said, as many survivors ""haven't told their children their story"".

The film, made by Netflix, was given its world premiere on Saturday inside the Angkor temple complex in Siem Reap, where Tomb Raider was partly filmed.

Among those present alongside Jolie and her six children was Cambodia's King Norodom Sihamoni, who in 2005 granted the actress Cambodian citizenship for the work done by an environmental foundation she established in the country.

The premiere was the first major public appearance for Jolie since she filed for divorce from Brad Pitt in September last year, citing irreconcilable differences.

The couple had been together since 2004 but only married in August 2014.

""It was very difficult,"" Jolie said. ""Many people find themselves in this situation. My whole family have all been through a difficult time. My focus is my children, our children.

""We are and forever will be a family and so that is how I am coping. I am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer.""

Oscars 2017: what's up for best foreign language film?

Cambodia's economy has grown rapidly in recent years, on the back of a large garment sector producing clothes for some of the world's biggest brands.

The government of long-time Prime Minister Hun Sen, himself a former Khmer Rouge cadre, takes credit for providing peace and development, but is accused of using heavy-handed tactics and the courts to subdue political opponents.

A UN-backed tribunal prosecuting senior Khmer Rouge leaders has convicted just a handful of people. Pol Pot died in 1998.

Jolie recently wrote a piece for the New York Times in response to US President Donald Trump's immigration ban, calling for her homeland to make decisions based on fact rather than fear.

She was reluctant to talk specifically about Mr Trump but said: ""The American people are bigger than any president. I suppose I have faith in my country and in what it is founded on and the values we hold dear.

""I believe that many of the things that we're hearing that we feel are based on a sense of spreading fear or hate or dividing people by race or judgement is un-American.

""At this time I think what is amazing is we are seeing people around the world start to speak out for their civil liberties and rights and what they feel. In America, we are hearing people say 'this is un-American to me, this is unconstitutional to me. And this is who I am'.""

Here come the bride and groom!

George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin made a splash upon their arrival in Venice on Friday. The couple hopped aboard one of the city's water taxis – fittingly named Amore – to arrive at the famed Belmond Hotel Cipriani, where they were hosting a small welcome gathering for friends attending their upcoming wedding.

Also taking water taxis for the glamorous festivities: Cindy Crawford and her husband Rande Gerber (the latter of whom has already made sure the celebrations will be well-stocked with tequila) and Matt Damon and his wife, Luciana.

A bar hall at the Cipriani was set aside for the welcome celebration, where Alamuddin, in a striped silk Dolce & Gabbana dress, and Clooney mingled with guests as they sipped Champagne and Bellinis. On Thursday gardeners at the hotel planted hundreds of white and pink Cyclamen blooms.

Other guests spotted arriving in Venice for the wedding include Clooney's close friends, actors John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Richard Kind and Ellen Barkin; his producing partner, Grant Heslov; and his cousin, NCIS: Los Angeles actor Miguel Ferrer, who RSVP'd very early.

Some family members started celebrating even earlier: Amal's sister, Tala, was spotted dining with a small group of fellow wedding revelers at local restaurant Da Ivo, a longtime Clooney favorite, on Thursday night, followed by drinks at the Cipriani.

The wedding is already the talk of the town in Venice, a city used to famous visitors (Clooney is a regular at the annual film festival). ""Ever since he admitted he would be marrying in Venice a few weeks ago, everyone wants to be in on it,"" says local Liliana Sermonetta. ""Where are they staying, what are they eating, will they take a gondola ride? It'll be difficult for Clooney to outdo Salma Hayek and François-Henri Pinault's wedding. The whole of Hollywood moved here for three days!""

The local government announced that the streets near the foot of the famous Rialto Bridge, in front of Ca'Farsetti, the town hall, are closed on Monday between 12 and 2 p.m. for Clooney's wedding – likely for a civil ceremony following the weekend celebrations.

But potential gondola gridlock aside, Venetians are happy to host the famous couple. ""We are glad that George chose our beautiful city to finally tie the knot,"" says waiter Giorgio Valli. ""We wish him a long and happy marriage to his beautiful wife.""

Since other p4p boxers have more sections, I don't see the issue with adding more for Vitali. But we can decide that in the future after his next fight. For now, there is only the Chisora fight. Given the slap in the pre-fight conference, spitting in Wladimir's face before the fight and brawling with Haye in the post-conference, I think this is worthy of a headline.

2518,"Kanye West Skipped Serena Williams’ Wedding To Avoid ‘Awkward’ Run In With Beyonce

While Kim Kardashian made it to Serena Williams’ wedding, Kanye West was noticeably not her plus one. We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details that he wanted to avoid an awkward run-in with Beyoncé at all costs.

There’s a good reason that Kanye West, 40, skipped the celebrity wedding of the season when tennis great Serena Williams married Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, 35 in a lavish New Orleans wedding on Nov. 16. While wife Kim Kardashian, 37, attended the big event, he knew that Serena’s close pal Beyonce, 36, was going to be on hand and he didn’t want an awkward confrontation. Especially after he dragged Bey and hubby JAY-Z, 47, so viciously during a Sacramento concert in Nov. of 2016. “It was no accident that Kanye chose to avoid Serena’s wedding. Kanye is not particularly close with Serena, or her husband, who are more Kim’s friends so Kanye opted out of what he felt may be an awkward evening for him. Kanye knew that Beyoncé, a close friend of Serena’s, would likely be at the wedding which might make for an uncomfortable situation,” a Yeezy insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.
“Kanye still has a lot of unresolved issues with Beyoncé and her husband. So, Kanye told Kim that he was going to sit this one out as to prevent causing a scene and risk stealing attention away from Serena’s big day, which Kim agreed was the smart decision,” our source continues. Yeezy hasn’t come face to face with Bey or Jay since his epic concert rants against them and the worst place for that to happen would be at a joyous event like someone’s wedding. See pics of guests at Serena’s wedding, here.

Kim played it safe and made it a girl’s trip to Serena’s big nuptials, bringing along sister Khloe‘s BFF Malika Haqq, 34, and her sis Khadijah Haqq, 34, as her dates instead of her hubby. Beyoncé also appeared to want to keep the attention on Serena and not any beef she or Jay might still have with Yeezy by leaving her husband at home as well. Kim and Beyoncé have never been close, and so no one expected any fireworks with those two being in the same room. They were both seated in the front row for Serena’s wedding, but were separated by Bey’s former Destiny’s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, 36, and her husband Tim Weatherspoon. The night belonged to the tennis G.O.A.T.’s  fairytale wedding and not anyone else’s drama.
HollywoodLifers, do you think it was wise of Kanye to skip a confrontation with Beyoncé at Serena’s wedding?

RumorFix reached out to a friend of Cameron's who gave us the real deal regarding the rumor. Asked if the Bad Teacher only used bottled water for bathing, we were told, ""No! Of course not.""

We also did a little digging after the fact and discovered that back in 2000, Cam did once admit to using Evian water for washing her face, but not her entire body as indicated in the article. We can see how Star came to their conclusion, but it's a total exagerration based off a statement made 11 years ago and now, just not true.

1703,"I disagree. The fact that it used to be single party government is largely an irrelvance; the important thing is that it is still a constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, that allows for both coalitions and majority rule. That hasn't changed, and so to say that because we currently have a coalition, of whatever party, means that the position of Deputy Prime Minister should be included alongside the heads of state and government is false. I am all for mentioning Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister in the article, around the same place David Cameron is currently described as Prime Minister, but to put Clegg alongside the Queen and Prime Minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right. Now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the Prime Minister's second-in-command, and if Cameron were to die/resign suddenly Clegg would become Prime Minister, I would completely agree that he should be there, but it isn't. Clegg may be Deputy Prime Minister, but he is not deputy head of government, and so he should not be put alongside the head of state and head of government.",0

2825,"Joe Giudice, Real Housewives' husband, transfers from New Jersey prison

CAMDEN, N.J. — The jailed husband of reality TV star Terese Giudice is being moved to a prison where he can receive a deportation hearing, authorities say.

The transfer for Giuseppe “Joe” Giudice, whose wife appears on The Real Housewives of New Jersey, comes after he went to court to challenge his treatment at Federal Correctional Institute Fort Dix, N.J.

The Italian-born Giudice alleged he had been improperly barred from an alcohol-abuse program that could shorten his term because he was considered a “deportable alien.”

Joe Giudice said he could not challenge that status while serving his sentence at Fort Dix because the South Jersey prison doesn’t allow inmates to appear before an immigration judge.

► May 8: 'Real Housewives' star Teresa Giudice gets probation reprimand

► September 2016: Martha Stewart served more jail time than Brock Turner

► July 2016: Jacqueline Laurita makes crack about Teresa Giudice

The Morris County couple were accused of falsifying loan applications and concealing assets during bankruptcy proceedings between 2001 and 2011.

In a filing earlier this month, a federal prosecutor argued that Joe Guidice’s complaint was moot because he’s being moved to a prison where he can challenge his immigration status.

The transfer to a prison in Allenwood, Pa., was expected to take place ""in the coming days,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica O'Neill said in a Nov. 6 filing in federal court here.

The 47-year-old is serving a 41-month sentence for conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud and other crimes. His participation in a residential drug abuse program could trim up to a year from a term set to end in March 2019, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons website.

Joe Giudice told an program screener that he was drinking “two or three bottles of wine daily” and using marijuana “occasionally” before entering prison in March 2016, according to a court filing. He also had a 2010 conviction for driving while intoxicated.

In rejecting his application for the residential program, authorities said Joe Giudice could not show he would be able to complete the final phase of “community confinement.” They noted a detainer allowed immigration officials to take him into custody for a deportation hearing after his release from prison.

O'Neill's filing said prison officials initiated Joe Giudice’s transfer Sept. 27, three weeks after he brought his court challenge.

Joe Giudice now is in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, according to the Bureau of Prisons website.

► March 2016: Teresa Giudice posts family pics before Joe reports to prison

► February 2016: Post prison, Teresa Giudice pens a best seller

U.S. District Judge Noel Hillman has not yet ruled on the inmate’s petition. Joe Giudice and his wife became celebrities through their appearances on the Real Housewives show, now in its eighth season on the Bravo cable-TV network.

Joe Giudice was sentenced in October 2014 but did not enter prison until his wife completed a 15-month term. She now lives in their mansion in Montville Township, N.J., the only one of several homes they still own.

Under a plea agreement, Joe Giudice admitted guilt to multiple counts of bankruptcy fraud. He also acknowledged failing to file a federal income tax return in April 2005 after making almost $245,000 in the previous year, court records say.

A lawyer for Joe Giudice, Jerard Gonzalez of Hackensack, N.J., could not be reached for comment.

2620,"Iggy Azalea and Odell Beckham Jr.: Dating!

You might be surprised by the news that Odell Beckham Jr. and Iggy Azalea are dating, but if you stop and think about it for a moment, they actually make perfect sense as a couple.

For one thing, Odell is famous for his one-handed catch, and Iggy is a famous one-hit wonder.

Beckham is forever frustrating defensive backs with his incredible talent, while Azalea frustrates her peers by being an offensive hack with an appalling lack of talent.

The list goes on and on:

Odell is a wide receiver, and Iggy receives widespread criticism for being awful.

Beckham runs hot routes and catches passes, while Azalea received a pass for being a terrible rapper because she's hot.

You get the idea.

Anyway, according to Us Weekly, Beckham and Azalea have finally started admitting that they're a couple.

Rumors that Odell and Iggy are dating first started circulating back in May, but both parties denied they'd been hooking up.

“I literally don’t even know Odell Beckham. I don’t,” Azalea told TMZ at the time.

“He was at my friend’s party and we took a picture with a bunch of people and that’s it. I don’t know him. I’ve not even had a conversation with him.”

Shortly thereafter, however, Iggy admitted that she and Beckham were more than friends, but insisted they had ""a long way to go” to become a couple.

Now, they're finally dating openly, but reps for Azalea are still lying about the relationship for some reason:

“It’s new, very fresh,” one insider tells Us.

Apparently, we're all supposed to ignore the fact that Iggy and Odell have clearly been dating for like six months.

We can actually see why Iggy would want to keep her love life out of the headlines.

Her last relationship imploded in spectacular fashion when LA Laker Nick Young was caught cheating on Iggy after his teammate uploaded a candid video of Young confessing to infidelity.

Shortly thereafter, Iggy learned that Young, whom she was engaged to at the time, had gotten another woman pregnant.

An experience like that would make anyone want to keep their next relationship on the DL for as long as possible.

For his part, Odell was previously dating model Polyxeni Ferfeli.

Everyone has a type, and apparently, Odell's is super into chicks with ridiculous names.

We wonder is Polyxeni is also a horrendous rapper ...

Miranda Lambert marked her second anniversary with Anderson East Tuesday by sharing a sweet snap on Instagram of herself and her musical beau sharing a kiss.

“‘Oh how I remember well, sunset on September 12th…’ #PushingTime🎶 #2yearstoday❤️#bamaboy @andersoneast 📷@bfluke,” she wrote in the caption.

The singer attended the Hand in Hand telethon – which is raised money for victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma — on Tuesday where she sang “If It Wasn’t For Texas” with George Strait.

Lambert, 33, and East, 30, began dating in September 2015, around three months after she and ex Blake Shelton announced they were separating.

The country star penned a sweet tribute for her boyfriend’s 30th birthday in July, writing on Instagram, “My favorite Bama boy turned 30 today. He owns the stage and he owns my heart.

2767,"Beyoncé Serves Up Lots of Smiles at Serena Williams' Wedding to Alexis Ohanian

When she sees two people “Crazy in Love,” Beyoncé can’t help but smile.

The songstress, 36, was one of 200 guests invited to Serena Williams‘ wedding to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian on Thursday in New Orleans, Louisiana, coincidentally the same city where Beyoncé filmed the music video for her hit Lemonade single, “Sorry,” which co-starred the bride.

Queen Bey dressed in a dark emerald green long-sleeve dress by Alexandre Vauthier that featured a plunging neckline and ruched detail at the bodice, as seen in photos from the wedding provided exclusively to Vogue.

Beyoncé also shared photos of her look on Instagram Sunday, giving fans a 360-degree view of her ensemble and exaggerated ponytail. She also shared close-up shots of her sparkling necklace and matching triangular earrings.

Also joining her at the star-studded event was her mother Tina Knowles-Lawson. Husband JAY-Z and their three children — Blue Ivy, 5, and 5-month-old twins Rumi and Sir — were not in attendance.

Beyoncé was in good company as she sat between BFF Kelly Rowland and Tony-winning star Cynthia Erivo during the ceremony. Other guests included Ciara, LaLa Anthony and Eva Longoria.

And following the “I do’s,” the mother of three was pictured enjoying a ride on the carousel at the reception.

RELATED GALLERY: See the A-List Guests at Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian’s New Orleans Wedding!

During a surprise performance by New Edition, the bride and groom performed a dance routine with the band as Beyoncé, Rowland, and Ciara cheered them on, according to Vogue.

Bey and Serena have been running in the same circles since the 22-time Grammy winner was a member of Destiny’s Child. The pair were introduced to each other in 2004 by Rowland.

Since they met, the women have continued to support each other.

“It’s great to have Beyoncé and Jay Z supporting,” Williams told E! News last September. “It’s always wonderful to see them at tennis, and it’s always good when you can just rely on someone and know that they’re always in your corner — whether they are there or not. And that’s kind of how it is with us.”

In 2015, Williams even did a parody video of Beyoncé’s “7/11.”

2802,"Obama Says Leaving Malia at College Was ‘Like Open-Heart Surgery’

After Malia Obama went off to Harvard University last month, her father couldn’t hold back the tears.

Barack Obama described that moment on Monday in a speech for the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children, which was named for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden’s older son, who died of brain cancer in 2015.

The former president said some kind words about Beau and his parents, Joe and Jill Biden, before talking about the joys and sorrows of watching children grow up.

“For those of us who have daughters, it just happens fast,” Mr. Obama said in a video published by WDEL, a news outlet based in Wilmington, Del.

“I dropped off Malia at college, and I was saying to Joe and Jill that it was a little bit like open-heart surgery, and I was proud that I did not cry in front of her. But on the way back, the Secret Service was all looking straight ahead pretending they weren’t hearing me as I sniffled and blew my nose. It was rough.”

Malia, 19, took a gap year after high school and opted to attend Harvard this year, despite her father’s advice that she could get a good education even if she did not attend “some name-brand, famous, fancy school.”

Both Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, attended law school at Harvard.

Mr. Obama has let the tears flow in public on a number of occasions, including when he spoke shortly after the death of his grandmother in November 2008; when he thanked his campaign staff after winning re-election in November 2012; and during a speech about gun violence in January 2016.

In his speech on Monday, Mr. Obama praised the work of the Beau Biden Foundation, which is dedicated to protecting children from abuse.

“At the end of our lives, whatever else we’ve accomplished, the thing that we’ll remember are the joys that our children — and hopefully, way later, our grandchildren — bring us,” he said.

“And holding their hand, swinging them on a swing, listening to them talk about what had happened in school; simple stuff, but ultimately that’s what matters.”

O.J. Simpson was granted parole Thursday, after serving almost nine years in prison for armed robbery and assault with a weapon, and late-night TV had a lot to say about it.

On ABC, Jimmy Kimmel mocked the local reporters who repeatedly announced throughout Thursday that ""the Juice is loose,"" before explaining who Simpson was to his younger viewers.

""O.J. Simpson — for those of you too young to remember, is the second-most embarrassing person associated with the Kardashian family, right after Scott Disick,"" said Kimmel.

""Technically, the Juice is not on the loose yet — he could be released by Oct. 1 — on which date, he will be picked up at the Lovelock Correctional Facility via helicopter and flown directly to the set of Dancing With The Stars, or Bachelor in Paradise. Whichever show is currently in production.""

On Comedy Central's Daily Show, Trevor Noah teased Simpson for saying he has mostly led a ""conflict-free life."" Impersonating the former football player Noah said, ""Yeah, I had a lot of conflict, and I mostly got off free.""

Noah continued: ""O.J. and his people reminded us that he’s been a model citizen in prison. He petitioned for books for the library; he coached a softball team; he never got in trouble. To me, that’s kind of a reason to keep him in prison — it’s the only place he’s not committing crimes.”

""O.J. got away baby,"" said Stephen Colbert in his monologue on CBS' Late Show. ""Finally, he has the opportunity to find the real killer. Step one: buy a mirror. It'll help.""

Colbert also showed a photo of Simpson and Donald Trump from 1993 and joked the photo was taken ""when it was still a coin toss which one of those guys would be president and which one would end up in jail.""

On NBC's Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon told his audience to be careful calling an Uber now, to make sure it's not a white Ford Bronco.

“O.J. actually video-conferenced into his parole hearing today, because the board was 120 miles away from his prison. Yeah, not a good sign when even the parole board is scared to be near him,"" he said.

""A lot of people didn’t know how to feel about the news. On one hand, O.J. is a convicted felon. But, on the other hand, he managed to keep Trump off TV for a whole afternoon,"" said Fallon, joking that it's kind of like community service.

The former football, film and TV star could be released as soon as Oct. 1, at which point he will have served the minimum of his nine- to 33-year sentence.

Commissioners who heard his case voted unanimously to grant the 70-year-old parole. The 2008 conviction — which stemmed from a failed attempt to steal sports memorabilia and other items he claimed had been stolen from him — came 13 years after his 1995 acquittal in the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.

The 1995 murder trial was a national sensation at the time, with interest reignited last year with the debut of FX's award-winning miniseries The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.

When asked if he would be able to stay out of trouble, Simpson explained that he had taken an alternatives to violence course, and also said, ""I had basically spent a conflict-free life,"" which got an immediate reaction on social media given the sensational murder trial and years of abuse allegations from his ex-wife.

In his closing remarks, he apologized again.

""I'm sorry it happened, I'm sorry, Nevada,"" he said. ""I thought I was glad to get my stuff back, but it just wasn't worth it. It wasn't worth it and I'm sorry.`""

2872,"Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Lose Court Case Over Their French Miraval Castle

The place is known as the Miraval Château, a castle and vineyard in the tiny town of Correns, near Aix-en-Provence in the south of France. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt bought it in 2008 for €45 million (about $67 million at the time), and it hosted their wedding six years later.

After three years of legal battle, the decision was originally delivered in April but wasn't revealed until French media broke the story last week. Meanwhile, the aggrieved designer, Odile Soudant, has filed another suit demanding to be legally recognized as the creator of the project.

The artist, who specializes in light installations, accused the Jolie-Pitt company of driving her business, Lumières Studio, into bankruptcy. She's also fighting Pitt for the intellectual property rights to the lighting she designed for the 17th century chateau and its outbuildings. Of the payout, €60,000 ($70,800) covers damage to her reputation, which she says has been severely affected by the failed project.

Pitt's lawyers had argued that the project was late and over budget—and that the design was Pitt's brainchild.

“When, in 2010, Brad Pitt came to ask her to bring to light four buildings of his domain at Miraval, the plastic artist Odile Soudant did not suspect that this Pharaonic building site was going to cause her ruin,” writes Le Point.

The Hollywood couple, according to the newspaper Liberation, which broke the story, launched a large remodeling plan intended to transform the property to their liking. Pitt hired Soudart in 2010 to run a €25 million project that would bring natural light into four of the buildings of the 40-bedroom domain where, in the late 1970s, the band Pink Floyd had recorded an album.

According to the newspaper, he wanted the visual artist to create ""an exceptional place with light at the center of everything.""

The collaboration went smoothly for three years until Pitt discovered that the company acting as the general contractor managing the network of businesses involved in the remodeling was inflating the costs. He then blocked all additional payments.

Until then, the artist and her 17 assistants and subcontractors had been working for the project in a Paris studio and partially completed the redesign at the property. Despite the fact that Pitt was no longer paying, according to her declaration, he asked her to continue working.

“Odile, I need you. Come here please. I need you to finish,” Brad Pitt wrote in an email to Soudart, according the court documents published by Liberation.

“I don’t know how things happen in France but in the United States, friends don’t attack friends,"" he wrote her in another email. ""I’ve been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let’s finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note. Life is too short, my friend,” he wrote to her in another.

In a third message, he wrote: “Don’t waste time with legal action. Follow your artistic journey and don’t worry about the rest.”

Her answers were desperate: ""My company and my bank accounts are well beyond the maximum. I can no longer use my credit card. I'm sinking. I do not ask you to pay everything, but at least a part...I do not know how to make you understand the urgency in which we are now. Without a quick solution, the consequences will be catastrophic.”

But the legal struggle has not yet ended. Soudart is now accusing Pitt of appropriating the creation of her work. The actor’s lawyers replied that the castle is ""purely private"" and not subject to copyright.

But Le Point concludes that “the estate is not as private as its owners claim: Recently it served as a backdrop for the latest Guerlain ad campaign by Terrence Malick. In one of the scenes, we see clearly—no pun intended—a luminous installation conceived by the plastic artist.”

The one minute clip  called ""Notes of a Woman"" shows Angelina Jolie  strolling through different spaces at Chateau Miraval, practicing her lines and wandering through the vineyard as a man creates a perfum.

 Archives 
 Archive 1 Friday 12th August 2005  Talk:Jack Abramoff/Archive 1 I made some substantial edits to the page and archived the entire earlier talk since it was mostly to do items since dealt with. 

COPYVIO
This article and it's sister screed are embarrassments to wikipedia.  They're essentially the same and both reflect the authors politocal hatred and zeal.  Both also have severe irredemable copyright problems and are and embarrasment to wikipedia.  They need to be deleted immediately.   

Alot of this article DOES seem to be a blatent copyvio.  Tyco, as below, was edited (the text was accurate, but half the news story was pasted in here).  You cannot just wholesale paste in paragraphs of text from a news story, attribute a link, and it not be a copywrite violation.  It's called Plagerism. 
  
 Tyco 
Almost the whole tyco section is a blatent rip from the WAPO article.  I've removed  part of it, as it needs to be re-written. 

I think I've cleaned much of the CopyVio stuff up, hopefully.  There is alot of non-essential stuff in this article about peripheral people, and not about Abramoff, however.  It needs to be cleaned up more, as the article meanders alot here and there.  

I reverted some things you took out (outside the Tyco section), like in the """"Early years"""" section and in the intro about DeLay. That material is not copyright infringement because it is properly sourced when directly quoted.  

It still needs to be rewritten to not be a direct copy paste unless you are going to quote it.  Just providing a link is not attribution, and copying entire paragraphs out of an article is plagiarism, not 'fair use' unless you are quoting. Also, if you are going to say 'the los angeles times reports' you need to source the times, not a 
secondary source (i.e. democracy now).

I modified the quote and attributed properly.

 

The speech from Tom DeLay is a direct quote (it's in quotations) so of course it is taken word-for-word from the source. I'll tweak the setup to the quote a little better as per your request. Here's the primary source for the other thing.  

No problem.  If I see something that is probable CopyVio I tend to chop it out first, and then rework it (I don't usually just leave it out, if the quote is accurate).  Btw have you found a link for the franken quote, I can't find anything other than on blogs.  Honestly I'm not sure what the relevence to an article on Abramoff is, really, anyway.

 The """"forced abortions"""" part was originally reported by Brian Ross at ABC News for 20/20 on March 13, 1998. It also appears in Al Franken's book The Truth (with jokes)'' in the """"Tom DeLay Saipan Sex Tour and Jack Abramoff Casino Getaway"""" chapter. Since we've agreed that primary sources are key, i've change the attribution in the article.  

 The Indian tribes scandal 
 
This area is a mess, I have tried to clean it up a bit and structure it better. It may be best to create a new page on the tribes scam and point the Reed, Norquist etc pages to it.

Basically we need fewer facts and more context. At the moment the page is simply a list of transactions that may or may not have been legit with a strong implication that they were not legit. 

I moved the whole scandal to its own page. This makes much more sense since although Abramoff is a major player in that scandal there are several others who are significant players, in particular Ralph Reed. I am not doing this to hide the scandal, I think that people looking for info on i",0
2835,"Jim Carrey Says He Has Sailed a 'River of Sorrow' in Emotional Stage Appearance

The 55-year-old comedian stopped by documentarian and activist Michael Moore‘s Broadway show The Terms of My Surrender on Thursday night for a candid conversation about the current political climate in the wake of president Donald Trump‘s election.

Among the many revelations in the 30-minute chat — which touched on everything from Carrey’s political paintings and sculptures to the DREAMers to the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia to Kathy Griffin‘s recent controversy — was a tender moment in which Carrey said he’s embraced hopelessness in his life a means of coping with difficulties.

“There’s a virtue in hopelessness,” Carrey said. “I’m not kidding. You’re off the hook and you don’t have to worry about what’s coming. ‘Okay, the world freaking ended. That’s great. Now what?'”

“Give up! Surrender to the idea that things are bad and yet still, from 3,000 feet up, we don’t matter,” he continued. “Things are happening and we’re going to happen along with them whether we like it or not. But we don’t matter. … Once you lose yourself, you’re pretty okay. Just get you out of the way.”

While Carrey’s advice was sparked by Moore’s questions about the Trump presidency, the Truman Show star said his philosophy was born out of pain he’s gone through in the past.

“We’re all so afraid of the river of tears,” Carrey said, explaining that he, like many, had avoided his problems in the past with “food and sex and noise and gadgets.”

“The fact is, going down the river of sorrow and suffering is the way to freedom,” he continued. “I’ve gone through it and I’m telling you, you don’t survive it. You don’t come out of it on the other side. You might come out of it with a body, but there’s no you attached to it.”

He added: “It’s tough to be yourself if you don’t have a self.”

Carrey has been open about struggling with depression since his youth. The past few years have been difficult ones: In 2015, his on-and-off girlfriend Cathriona White  died by suicide. Since then he’s been involved in legal battles with her family over wrongful death allegations, which he denies.

Carrey told Moore that choosing what part he wants to play in life has helped him move forward.

“Know that no matter what happens, this is not who you are,” Carrey said. “You choose the part you want to play in this life. I want to be a good guy. I want to do good things. I want to make people happy and I want to help out when I can. So you do what you need to do.”

Elsewhere in his chat with Moore — which came towards the end of the the Oscar-winning director’s impassioned two-and-a-half hour one-man show — Carrey laid into President Trump, claiming the 71-year-old former Celebrity Apprentice host deceived working-class voters into thinking he wasn’t a member of the “elite” group he had so aggressively attacked during his campaign.

“They say that the best trick the devil ever did was convincing people that he didn’t exist, but I think the best trick was convincing 40 percent of this country that this truffle pig who spends half of his presidency gargling caviar behind the wheel of a golf cart isn’t the elite,” Carrey said. “He has a golden f—— apartment. It’s just incredible.”

“How does he do that with a baseball cap?” Carrey asked. “I used to think Clark Kent’s disguise was flimsy. ‘Dude you’re Superman, you’re busting out of the suit, it’s obvious!’ Trump makes that look intricate.”

Carrey also criticized what he called “a war on intelligence and discernment in this country,” saying that people are “made to feel guilty for being smart.”

Carrey said that he hopes both Trump supporters and critics find a way to understand one another moving forward — as “every person is to be cared about and thought of as precious, including the people that don’t agree with us.”

“I don’t like this trend of, ‘If you don’t agree with me, it’s hatred,’ ” Carrey said. “When you don’t agree with someone, you don’t agree with them. It doesn’t mean that it’s hatred. And we have to get back to that and have discourse. We can disagree with each other.”

2736,"Catherine Zeta-Jones gives marriage advice saying people are too quick to get divorced

Catherine Zeta-Jones has told how she battled through problems with husband Michael Douglas – and said people are ""too quick"" to divorce.

The Welsh beauty, 46, said: ""You've got to keep the home fires burning. It's a long road and I think people today are so quick to throw in the towel.

""You have to give it your best shot and not give up when the first problem arises.""

Telling how they marked 15 years of marriage, she said: ""It was great. Just the two of us at one of our favourite restaurants, laughing that we haven't killed each other yet – and that we're still alive! Fifteen years is a long time.""

The couple, who have son Dylan, 15 and daughter Carys, 12, reunited in 2014 after a brief separation, and also suffered the trauma of Michael's cancer diagnosis in 2010.

On facing the illness together, she said: ""We tried to keep it as private as possible, but it's very hard. I didn't talk to other people about it enough. That's one thing I'd do more of.

""Our children asking, 'Is Daddy going to die?' was really hard. It was an experience that I'm so happy is in our rear-view mirror.""

Catherine, who plays journalist Rose Winters in the new Dad's Army film, also denied she has ever been under the knife, though she did not rule it out for the future.

She told Good Housekeeping magazine: ""I'm not anti-plastic surgery. If I feel like it I'm going to go ahead and do it.""

She credited exercise for her youthful looks, saying: ""I run on my treadmill or power walk outside, then do some bodywork and arm work and a bit of tap dancing. It's healthy for a body to sweat every day.""

Although I understand your arguments, I am surprised you don't understand mine.  I don't find it labyrinthine, or at least not particularly so.  (Not more than many other events and aspects concerning the Beatles.)  Nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure, since it can be taken from any number of texts on the Beatles.  However, though I support the original author's intent here, I guess you and I are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now.  At some point, however, I will source his/her statements  as soon as I find time to delve into the texts  just because I would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you.  Until then, I don't think we will make much more progress on this.
 

[The problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth.  But to me, discrediting the original author's intent is like a dog biting its own tail.  From wikipedia: re.

2795,"Stop Right Now! The Spice Girls Might Be Planning A Reunion

There are certain things that people just shouldn't joke about. A potential Spice Girls reunion with all five members is one of them.

Earlier this morning, news broke that the most iconic girlband of all time may be reuniting in 2018, sending chills down the spines of every 90s girl power advocate up and down the country.

According to the Independent, Mel C has reportedly been working quietly with the band's former boss Simon Fuller over the past few months to bring Victoria Beckham, Mel B, Emma Bunton and Geri Horner (née Halliwell) back for the one-off special, with a compilation record expected to land next year.

A source told The Sun: 'The five of them have been locked in secret talks since the summer, and finally they are all on-board for a 2018 reunion.

'As it stands, they will be working together on a series of projects, which will include an album and a TV special celebrating the Spice Girls - and getting Victoria to agree has been a coup for everyone involved, given she has always been the person holding back on a reunion.'

But alas, Spice Girls fans, we need to stay rational about this.

Put away the platform trainers and ask yourself, 'would Victoria actually agree to this?'

Let us present an analysis...

Although many a source is reporting that Scary, Baby, Sporty, Ginger and Posh are set to make a comeback next year, we mustn't forget the numerous times that Beckham has staunchly opposed a Spice reunion.

It was only earlier this year that ex-Posh Spice turned fashion mogul told U.S. breakfast show The Today Show that 'there won't be a reunion because I think that when we performed at the Olympics, it was so great, and that was us celebrating everything that we'd achieved'.

She then went on to say: 'I still talk to all the other girls, we're still very close, but I think you need to know when it's time to actually say, ""That was great, we achieved a lot,"" and everybody moves on.'

A new album doesn't sound much like moving on, does it?

Understandably, Victoria now has a family and a thriving business in the fashion industry to look after and, in the past, has cited these commitments as her reasoning for not wanting to reunite with her bandmates.

All hope is not lost, however, as, when asked about a potential Spice Girls reunion, Mel C was previously quoted on The Nightly Show saying: 'I kind of feel like it's not really doing the band justice to go out as a four piece, whoever's missing it doesn't matter.'

So, surely if there were to be some kind of reunion it must involve all five original members... right?

Dare we believe the rumours that all five have been in 'secret talks' over the summer and are on board? Should we really raise our hopes that high?

Whatever the case, the Spice Girls will always 'Viva Forever' in our hearts.

2834,"‘Megyn Kelly Today’ Ratings Not All Sunshine for NBC’s New Morning Host

With its host reportedly making a salary of $17 million a year and a new set having been constructed within NBC’s Rockefeller Plaza headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, “Megyn Kelly Today” is more costly than the previous 9 a.m. segment of “Today.” Losing viewers, in the long run, would be a problem.

Ms. Kelly’s first week was highly scrutinized, and the early reviews for the show were brutal. She addressed them at the end of her hour on Sept. 29, saying, “It’s been very exciting, it’s been so educational, I’ve been just so delighted by the media response, which is really” — she shook her head before continuing — “no.”

After a breath, she added, “The viewer response has been awesome!”

As Ms. Kelly moved away from the sometimes prosecutorial persona she inhabited during much of her tenure at Fox, there were a few bumpy moments. The “Will & Grace” star Debra Messing said after appearing on the show that she regretted having done so. Jane Fonda blanched when Ms. Kelly asked her to talk about plastic surgery procedures she has had. And a vulgarity uttered by a cameraman who inadvertently walked into a shot went viral.

Another awkward moment came on Oct. 3, two days after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, when Ms. Kelly cut off Tom Brokaw, the former longtime NBC anchor and network eminence, as he went into a lengthy discourse on gun rights and the National Rifle Association.

“Got it,” Ms. Kelly said, adding that she had to “leave it at that, Tom,” before shifting to a commercial break. (Mr. Brokaw later told The Washington Post that he was having problems with his hearing aid. “I’m a Kelly fan,” he added.)

Ms. Kelly has said that the show would be a mix of a talk show and a news show, and it has moved in both directions, from typical morning fare — celebrity interviews, a segment involving an adorable crime-fighting dog — to gritty discussions of the O. J. Simpson and Menendez brothers cases.

NBC has said from the start that it would be patient with the show. Andrew Lack, the network’s news chairman, told affiliates months ago that he did not expect things to be “perfect” with both of Ms. Kelly’s new programs — she also hosts a Sunday evening show, which is on hiatus — in the early going.

At least for now, it appears that Ms. Kelly’s main competitor, ABC’s “Live with Kelly and Ryan,” will maintain a lead in the ratings. In the top 56 media markets, “Live” beat “Megyn Kelly Today” by 21 percent in households last week, according to Nielsen.

Exact audience figures for last week’s episodes of “Live,” a syndicated show featuring Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, will not be available until next week. It averaged an 2.8 million viewers in the week before Ms. Kelly’s debut, with 915,000 in the 25-to-54 age range.

For Ms. Kelly and NBC executives, there was one hopeful nugget buried in the Nielsen data: The number of viewers in the 25-to-54 demographic was 755,000 on Sept. 29, after having fallen to roughly 649,000 the day before.

Allison Williams wasn’t on hand to cheer on her Girls co-stars at the Emmy Awards on Sunday night, but she probably didn’t miss the spectacle—she was too busy celebrating being a newlywed. The actress’s wedding to CollegeHumor co-founder Ricky Van Veen took place at a Wyoming ranch on Saturday, and so far—like a true Millennial—all she’s shared about the big event is this Instagram, featuring her custom Oscar de la Renta gown.

People had more details, including that Tom Hanks was the officiant (his wife Rita Wilson plays Marnie’s mom on Girls) and other guests included Katy Perry, John Mayer, Bruce Springsteen, Seth Meyers, Diane von Furstenberg, Barry Diller, Mindy Kaling, and of course, Girls co-stars Lena Dunham and Jemima Kirke. Dunham’s Instagram included some shots of the road trip to and from the Wyoming ranch, but none of the event itself.

If Williams were more like her Girls character, we could probably expect an entire album of weepy singer-songwriter tracks about the big day. But the real Williams, thankfully, will probably celebrate much more like a normal person—and hopefully share a few more Instagrams for the rest of us whose invitations were surely lost in the mail.

2895,"The Mystery of How Kendall Met the Hadids Has Been Solved

Not too long ago Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid were just two young, unconnected girls who occasionally appeared on their family members' reality television show. Then the world blinked and all the sudden they were burgeoning supermodels and super influencers. Then the world blinked again and they were bonafide supermodel BFFs. Another blink and their sisters, Kylie and Bella, were also burgeoning influence and burgeoning models in their own right.

One more blink and they're now four of the most famous young women on the entire planet and they all hang out with each other in various groupings and form the core of one of the most powerful girl squads in the entire world.

Of this we all know, and, yet, what we did not know is how any of them actually came to actually know each other and became friends in the first place.

There were simple guesses: Kendall and Gigi just met on the fashion circuit and took a liking to one another.

There were more complicated guesses based on the fact that the two pairs of sisters are sort of ""related"" in the way that all European royal families are sort of related—through a complicated string of marriages and divorces. The story: before Kris Jenner, the Jenners' father Caitlyn—née Bruce—used to be married to a woman named Linda, and after their divorce Linda married the composer David Foster. Linda and David also got divorced, and then the Hadids' mother Yolanda married David after her first marriage to the sisters' biological father Mohamed. Naturally, Yolanda and David are now divorced as well.

So, maybe some assumed they just met at a very awkward extended family reunion, of sorts.

As it happens, that is not the case.

Earlier this year came a stunning new clue in the mystery. While everyone thought that it was Kendall and Gigi who were the original nexus of the friendship web, it turned out that Kendall was actually friends with Bella first.

Now, finally, after far too long spent thinking about this, we have a definitive answer and it is way, way more mundane and even a bit geekier than we ever imagined.

""I met her for the first time seven years ago over Twitter,"" Bella told InStyle . “That was before we started modeling; I was probably 14 or 15. We met up and had sushi, and now we’re best friends. She’s a pretty significant human I met online.”

While there is still shame in this world about admitting you've met anyone online, the fact that two of the most popular girls in the world did so back when they were ""14 or 15"" should satisfy everyone, and, once and for all, any questions about how the Jenners met the Hadids.

It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so.

 POV concerns 

Im surprised this article isn't being called anti-semetic, because it's has a *few* traces of Islamic perspectives in it. You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.

This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation

""""According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: """"Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery."""" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.""""

This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?

There are articles for """"Criticisms of Islam"""" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate """"criticisms of Islam"""" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.

Good day.

  

Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where """"treason"""" or """"traitor"""" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.

Dear Devotus, 
I have still issues with your changes:
Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don't try you shift the balance - removing a book from """"each side"""" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins. He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.
While your first version was needlessly verbose (""""it is to be noted that""""), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.

2630,"Sour Note! Zayn Forced Into Disastrous Duet With Taylor

RadarOnline.com has learned Zayn Malik and Taylor Swift’s Fifty Shades Darker duet only came about after he was forced to collaborate with the superstar.

The former One Direction singer recorded the track “I Don’t Want To Live Forever” for the film’s soundtrack, but a source noted Swift wasn’t a part of his original plan.

“Zayn loved the song and wanted it for himself; he was desperate to record it as a solo track and thought it would be a real career boost,” the source explained.

“It has all of the high notes he can reach and was perfect, but movie bosses said it had to be a collaboration and wanted him to work with Taylor.”

According to the source, 24-year-old Malik relented because Swift, 27, is one of the biggest pop star on the planet — and she happens to be best friends with his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid.

Still, “It was a surprise to everyone,” said the source, noting that “it’s not as if they’re really great friends and they didn’t even appear in scenes together for the video.”

Unfortunately, Malik’s decision may come back to haunt him.

“The song was a hit with movie fans, but it wasn’t massively well received by Taylor or Zayn’s hard-core fan base,” the source told Radar.

The situation isn’t the only setback Malik’s weathered recently. He was recently told he couldn’t perform on Saturday Night Live with Jimmy Fallon, who chose Harry Styles over him.

“His team tried to get him on SNL to perform his latest track but they told him no,” the source told Radar.

“They often have to have two songs, and Harry agreed to do ‘Sign of the Times’ and ‘Ever Since New York’. It was disappointing for Zayn, but he just had to move past it.”

2790,"Lady Gaga Announces Netflix Documentary, Talks Madonna Feud

Lady Gaga is ready to open up. The “Joanne” singer has a candid documentary titled Gaga: Five Foot Two premiering on Netflix on September 22.

Gaga, 31, took to social media early Thursday, August 24, to share a series of teasers for her new project, in addition to revealing the stunning, artistic poster. Directed by Emmy-nominated filmmaker Chris Moukarbel, the documentary will provide “an intimate and unfettered portrait of a year in the life of Lady Gaga,” according to a press release from Netflix.

“Offstage, in the studio, unplugged and at home, audiences get an unguarded glimpse at Gaga through a series of personal highs and lows and the culmination of a year’s emotional journey,” the release continues. “From struggles with relationships to health issues, from finding solace in her inner circle to conquering her insecurities, Gaga: Five Foot Two navigates the divide between life as a superstar and life as an everyday woman.”

In one of the teasers for the film, Gaga breaks down in tears after her July 2016 split from fiancé Taylor Kinney. “I’m alone every night. And all these people will leave, right? They will leave, and then I’ll be alone,” she explains. “And I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.”

In another clip, the six-time Grammy winner opens up about her long-standing feud with Madonna. “I admired her always, and I still admire her no matter what she might think of me. The only thing that really bothers me about her is that…” she says before the video cryptically cuts off.

Gaga: Five Foot Two premieres on Netflix on Friday, September 22.

2721,"Who could succeed Anna Wintour at US Vogue?

As rumours that Sarah Jessica Parker will succeed Anna Wintour at US Vogue are shot down, we ask: Who could step into Wintour's Manolo Blahniks when the time comes?

It's possibly the most ludicrous fashion rumour we've ever heard but claims that Anna Wintour has been grooming Sarah Jessica Parker as her replacement at US Vogue got us thinking: who will replace her when she eventually leaves?

Wintour's will be some metaphorically big shoes to fill, she is American Vogue. Here we place our bets...

Victoria Beckham: the chameleon 

 She's come a long way since her days as a Zig-a-zig-ah-ing Spice Girl and now sits firmly at the top of the international fashion tree. Who's to say she can't morph into a magazine editor next?

Anna Dello Russo: the exchange programme 

 Can you imagine Vogue in the hands of the woman that brought us 'Fashion Shower'. Wouldn't it be amazing? A stalwart fashion editor, Dello Russo certainly has the vision, even if it is a bit, umm, outrageous.

Amy Astley: the safe choice 

 The editor-in-chief of Vogue's little-sister publication Teen Vogue, Amy Astley has worked with Wintour before when she was a beauty editor at Vogue. Well respected in fashion circles, Astley would be a very safe pair of hands to leave big Vogue in.

Natalie Massenet: the business guru 

 The founder of Net-A-Porter, Natalie Massanet is an omnipotent presence in British fashion as the chair of the BFC. However, she's US-born, used to be a fashion editor at Tatler and she's got Wintour's seal of approval. ""Natalie's doing a very good job,"" said the editor-in-chief of Massenet's impact on London Fashion Week. ""She's a very organised person and she's obviously having an impact on where the shows are located.""

Eva Chen: the protegée 

 When Wintour became artistic director of Condé Nast she immediately bumped former beauty editor Eva Chen up to editor of Lucky, one of Conde Nast's US titles. Chen is very well known, and liked, in the industry meaning the top title at Vogue may well be hers one day.

Marc Jacobs: the curveball 

 Think about it. ""He's opinionated and has some spare time now [that he's left Louis Vuitton],"" says Lisa Armstrong, ""also a brilliant stylist in addition to knowing what we all want to wear.""

Tamara Mellon: the all-rounder 

 The Jimmy Choo co-founder has business savvy and a creative mind. Since setting up her eponymous label (in NYC, no less) she knows how to stand up to a boardroom of investors and get ideas off the ground. Plus she's glamorous, supremely well-connected and used to work at British Vogue.

Tonne Goodman: the internal hire 

 Surrounded by British-born counterparts at US Vogue, Goodman, the magazine's fashion director is like a fresh breath of Manhattan air. Styling tricky celebrities is her bread and butter, and no-one understands the demands of the high-earning American woman better than she.

Roger Federer: the sporty spice 

 OK, this suggestion is as likely as Andy Murray winning Wimbledon (oh... hang on) but the tennis supremo attends shows with Anna, while she cheers him on from the stands. He certainly knows how to wear a suit, and has probably learnt more than meets the eye from those fashion soirees the two love to hang out at.

John Galliano: the provocateur 

 A curveball perhaps but it's well known that Anna is a huge supporter of Galliano's. It was her that got him his first post-scandal job at Oscar de la Renta and what better way to bring him back to the top than to seat him in her big, shiny editor's office?

Lena Dunham: the voice of a generation 

 Dunham is US Vogue's current flavour of the month, quite literally, as she appears on the February cover - the result of months of wooing by Wintour, apparently. Often dubbed 'the voice of her generation', she would certainly bring a new voice.

Lucy Yeomans: the Brit pick 

 Yeomans was appointed editor of Harper's Bazaar in the UK when she was just 29 years of age. Now masterminding the launch of Net-A-Porter.com's first print magazine, Porter, fashion journalism runs through her veins.

Meryl Streep: when life imitates art 

 As The Telegraph's fashion editor Lisa Armstrong comments: ""If we're choosing editors based on the fact they once played writers, what about someone who actually played an er, editor - Meryl Streep?"" A valid point we're sure you'll agree.

Stefano Tonchi: the editor's choice 

 Italian-born Tonchi would be a publisher's dream; he's the current editor of style bible W (also owned by Conde Nast) and has previously worked at Esquire, L'Uomo Vogue and edited T: The New York Times Style Magazine. He moves in similar circles to Wintour and would be editorially-focused.

Mariah Carey and her manager of three years, Stella Bulochnikov, are no longer working together as manager and client, Variety has confirmed.

According to a statement from Bulochnikov, the two mutually agreed that working together was no longer beneficial. “After working together for almost three years, Mariah Carey and Stella Bulochnikov have determined that it is in their mutual best interest to part ways on day-to-day management,” the statement reads.

“During their time working together, they have accomplished great things, including, most recently, Mariah Carey’s new music and motion picture projects for this upcoming holiday season. Mariah Carey and Stella Bulochnikov remain partners in a number of business ventures, and will continue to support each other in those endeavors.”

A former TV producer, Bulchnikov was responsible for directing Carey’s career towards reality television, launching her “Mariah’s World” show on E!. She was also working with Carey at the time of her disastrous New Year’s Eve performance in 2016.

Carey’s previous managers include her ex-husband Tommy Mottola, Randy Jackson, Red Light Management and Jermaine Dupri, among others.

She recently recorded a new song, “The Star,” for the film of the same name. She is well known for her 1994 song “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” off her first holiday album “Merry Christmas,” and recently had her hands and feet encased in cement in the forecourt of the Chinese Theatre.

Let's see, accusations of parroting, arbitrary classification of users based upon pen-name preferences, straw-men, ignoratio elenchi, and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously. We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.

It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

2642,"Inside Rob K. & Mehgan James' Romance: Why His Fam ''Doesn't Approve''

UPDATE: As new reports continue to surface regarding Rob Kardashian's relationship with Mehgan James, both took to social media to weigh in on the matter.

""Wait reading online about some chick I'm dating Megan something. Not true never even met her or heard of her before,"" he tweeted Thursday.

James retweeted his message and also wrote on Instagram Friday, ""Before any of you start defaming my character .. I'm CLEARLY not dating rob , nor have I ever confirmed that I was . You all just so happen to believe everything you read. I posted one pair of Arthur George socks 2/3 weeks ago & now all of a sudden I'm a home wrecker, a fraud , a hoe... etc.""

""I'm just 'Megan something.' that most of you 'never heard of,'"" she added. ""I don't have that type of power. I was just as confused as anyone else and was told not to even entertain it.""

As reports swirl around a possible romance between the E! reality star and Mehgan James, E! News can confirm the pair are in fact an item and started dating three months ago. As for what makes their relationship work, an insider tells E! News it's the encouragement Rob feels from the Bad Girls Club star that's really moved the blossoming fling in a positive direction.

""Mehgan supports Rob and all of his endeavors, and just wants to help him,"" the source shares. ""They are very much best friends. She just wants to be there for him.""

And while we've yet to see the celeb couple step out hand-in-hand, James has taken to social media to support her boyfriend's Arthur George sock line. ""MY best friend knows I love socks & The Kardashians. So she got me a 2 in one,"" she wrote on Instagram last month.

Melania Trump has issued her own executive order: She refuses to share a bed with Donald Trump.

Inside sources have told US Weekly that the 46-year-old Slovenian stunner does not sleep in the same bed with the president even during the rare times when they are in the same city.

""They have separate bedrooms,"" one Trump insider told the magazine. ""They never spend the night together - ever.""

Added a second insider, ""Melania does not keep hidden from everyone around her how miserable she is.""

A third source told the magazine that the couple sleeps in the same room but keeps separate beds, explaining, ""It's very 'royal' of them!""

The magazine features the story on its current cover, headlined, ""Separate Bedrooms - Behind closed doors Melania and Donald Trump give each other lots of space and continue to live very much apart.""

A rep for Melania strongly denied the separate-bed claim, telling the magazine, ""It's unfortunate that you are going to feature unnamed 'sources' that have provided fictional accounts.""

Still, it's indisputable that the first couple has continued to spend most of their time at least 200 miles apart, with Donald in Washington and Melania remaining with their son, Barron, 11, in the family's triplex penthouse at Trump Tower in Manhattan.

She keeps the most limited of public schedules as first lady.

""Melania wants as little to do with Donald as possible,"" an insider, described as a ""family source,"" told the magazine.

If reports are to be believed, then Meghan Markle could be about to give her current living sitch a royal upgrade. Literally.

The Daily Mail is reporting that Prince Harry, Meghan's ordinary and under-the-radar boyfriend,  is having an apartment in Kensington Palace renovated with the intention that he and Meghan live there together.

""He [Prince Harry] keeps popping round and asking when it will be ready. He seems in a real hurry to move in with Meghan,"" a source told the Mail Online.

Harry currently lives in Nottingham Cottage, a two-bedroom house on the Kensington estate, but it seems he's in the market for an upscale. According to the reports, the apartment (which here doesn't mean 'a small house in an apartment block', but rather 'an entire wing of Kensington Palace, similar to Kate and Wills' 22-room house') is located next to Harry's brother and sister-in-law, meaning Meghan will also inherit some tiny neighbours in the form of Prince George and Princess Charlotte.

Meghan, 35, and Harry, 32, seems to be moving relatively quickly after getting together mid-last year. The two have already attending weddings together (something Kate and Wills didn't do until after they were engaged), met each other's families (and when your family includes the Queen of England, that's a relatively big deal) and told friends an engagement is on the way.

Maybe Meghan will be able to attend Pippa Middleton's 'no bling, no bring' wedding after all.

Underage children are children beneath the legal age of consent (different states have 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 as the underage limit. Children in most countries means someone under the age of 18. In Ireland for example, a 'child' aged 17 is over the age of consent. In Britain it is 16. Do you know the first thing about the topic?

The death of Owen Wilson’s beloved dad has friends fearing the tortured actor might spiral back into a pit of depression!

“Owen is devastated over his dad’s death,” confided a source. “He meant the world to him!”

Legendary TV producer Robert Wilson — father to actors Owen, Luke and Andrew — died at 75 on May 5 after a years-long struggle with Alzheimer’s disease.

“For me and my brothers, there just wasn’t a bigger influence on us,” said the Zoolander star, 48. “I really believe that his spirit gets carried on through me.”

As RadarOnline.com reported, Wilson was rushed to the hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. in August 2007, after swallowing a fistful of prescription pills and cutting his wrists in a suicide bid.

Pals revealed the actor had been devastated over a string of failed romances, including a bitter breakup with actress Kate Hudson.

By early 2008, Owen was boozing again, and friends feared it could trigger another suicide attempt.

Now the loss of his father has sparked new fears for the Wedding Crashers comedian.

Josh Duhamel was tired of his pop-star wife Fergie’s “partying” before their breakup, we’re told.

Sources close to the actor tell us that he didn’t want to split with his wife of eight years.

According to pals, their marriage broke down over the course of about a year, in spite of trying couples’ therapy.

The long slide coincided with the recording of Fergie’s first solo album in 11 years, “Double Dutchess.”

“[Fergie] was very focused on her album and being a rock star again, and Josh felt like she was going back to her ‘old ways,’ ” we’re told.

The former Black Eyed Peas singer was a notorious party animal in her youth, and even battled drug problems — although there has been no suggestion she has started using drugs again.

Reps didn’t get back to us.

Page Six reported this week that fans are wondering if Fergie’s upcoming second solo album was inspired by her breakup with Duhamel, with tracks such as “Love Is Blind” and “Love Is Pain.”

Fergie admitted to Page Six, “There’s a lot of my life, and my vulnerable side.”

I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.

WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents

User: AuburnPilot

A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency.

Billboard pointed out that when it comes to the impressions of Miley and the other new coach, Alicia Keys, they're hitting the high notes of a position that can challenge even the most accomplished singer.

Coaches are tasked with taking on aspiring crooners, guiding them through the competition and providing them with tips on everything from stage presence to blending with the band. Even though Blake and Adam are experienced at banter, Cyrus and Keys immediately showed they were up to the challenge of teasing the guys while luring the best contestants onto their teams.

But what viewers can't see is the drama unfolding among Shelton, Levine, and Miley, according to OK. The battle has become so intense that Cyrus was hurt to the point of tears, and now she's doing her best to stay on the show and avoid quitting.

Team Miley seems to be rocking it when it comes to attracting the best wanna-be singers on the show, but sources cited by OK revealed that the ""Wrecking Ball"" singer is struggling because of the incessant feuding. However, even though she's battling both Blake and Adam, she is trying to stay strong, added one of the insiders.

Cyrus has ""been in tears"" during the filming of the singing competition TV show, with her tears caused by Adam ""constantly"" picking on her, revealed the source. Levine allegedly didn't stop with annoying Miley himself. Instead, he also persuaded his buddy Blake to ""gang up"" on the younger singer, added the insider.

Moreover, the feud reportedly has been gradually building to a crescendo, with Cyrus and Adam ""at each others' throats"" since the first day of filming, according to the source.

""[Levine] wants nothing to do with [Miley],"" summed up the insider.

Even though Adam has recruited Blake to help him annoy Cyrus, the source shared that it's Levine who is focused on feuding.

As for just how bad it's gotten, Cyrus has threatened that she will quit The Voice as a result of the environment becoming ""so bad,"" added the insider.

Alicia Keys is noticeably absent from the feud allegations, and Miley recently commented on reports that she and Alicia had teamed up so that for the first time, two female coaches could challenge Blake and Adam.

Dishing with Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, Miley clarified that she had not chosen to unite with Alicia in order to have a ""boys against girls"" competition on The Voice. Instead, she has been siding with Keys because being sandwiched between Adam and Blake was infuriating, reported 98.7 Radio.

Despite reports claiming that Levine is bickering with Cyrus, she told Jimmy that in reality, it's Adam and Shelton who are arguing constantly.

""It never stops,"" she revealed about the bickering between Blake and Adam. ""Even when the cameras are off, that is real.""

Cyrus admitted that when she viewed the show, she assumed that the playful banter was just done for the cameras. But rather than end when filming stops, Levine and Shelton keep right on bickering.

""I always thought it was like a little thing they do on camera, no, it's all day,"" she summed up.

2720,"Guy Ritchie enjoys laid-back bike ride with son Rocco amid claims ex-wife Madonna is 'close to agreeing a deal for the teen to stay in London'

Madonna and Guy Ritchie are battling for custody of son, 15, through court
Judge in Manhattan court told them to solve dispute themselves
Rocco currently lives with father in London and says he wants to stay there
Source claims Madonna close to agreeing, so long as he visits US regularly 
Guy was spending quality time with his son amidst legal drama  



It was recently reported that Madonna is close to agreeing a deal for her son Rocco to stay in London with his father Guy Ritchie after a judge laid into them for dragging the dispute through the courts.

And the filmmaker appeared unfazed as he spent some quality time with his 15-year-old in the English capital, enjoying a leisurely bike ride in the midst of the ongoing cross-Atlantic custody battle.

Guy and Rocco were clad in matching waterproof jackets and grey hoodies as they indulged in some gentle exercise following the stress of the court hearing earlier this week.

The Man From U.N.C.L.E director topped off his athletic look with a beanie hat, while Rocco sported a baseball cap.

The teen - who has been living with his father in London since fleeing his mother's Rebel Heart Tour in December - was busy checking his phone as he cycled along behind his dad.

Rocco is adamant he wants to continue living with his father in London, and it's claimed Madonna is close to agreeing to a deal.

The pair have been fighting for custody since December, culminating with Madonna's lawyers calling for Mr Ritchie to be arrested this week.

But sources say Madonna is close to agreeing a deal to let Rocco stay in the UK with his father, 47, so long as he returns to the US for regular holidays.

As news of the deal emerged, Madonna posted a bizarre video of herself online with the caption 'tears of a clown'.

The 10-second video shows the singer spinning and tap-dancing on a catwalk in a red polka-dot suit and mask.

The deal could finally be an end to the dispute which has been dragged through the courts since December, when the 15-year-old refused to go back to New York to see his mother.

A source close to the couple said: 'It's obvious they can't force Rocco to return and the judge was told he's too old to be forced,' reports The Sun.

'But Madonna wants to make sure she regularly sees him and they spend time together. They are just looking at the final details now like public holidays.'

Just yesterday, lawyers for Madonna demanded that the star's ex-husband Guy Ritchie be arrested for contempt of court for not abiding terms agreed in their divorce in 2008.

Her legal team made the dramatic demand during a bitter court hearing in New York which both she and Ritchie were listening to by phone.

Madonna's lawyer Eleanor Alter said that Ritchie should have brought Rocco to New York to resolve the dispute, because he was required to according to terms in the legally-binding divorce.

She said: 'He taught his son that obeying court orders was not important and I think that's one of the most serious things that's happened in this case that's detrimental to Rocco.'

Alter said that Ritchie's conduct was 'contempt' and the court went so far as to discuss the possibility that a warrant could be issued for Ritchie's arrest.

She added that the contempt should be enforced but New York Supreme Court Justice Deborah Kaplan refused to issue the warrant for Ritchie's arrest.

Ritchie's lawyer Peter Bronstein angrily rejected the demand from Madonna's team and said that his client had not even been held in contempt so an arrest was not being considered yet.

Justice Kaplan scolded both Ritchie and Madonna and said their son just wanted the case over.

She said: 'Frankly both parties have chosen to live their lives in a very public way and may welcome the publicity, but the child has not.

'He would like this matter resolved and the issues concerning him and his family in the most private way possible'.

Lawyers for both sides grew increasingly ill-tempered as the hearing went on.

See more of the latest Madonna updates as she fights for custody of her son Rocco

Alter, for Madonna, said that things she had been told by Mr Bronstein about English law had 'proved to be incorrect' and that some of the 'protections' she'd hoped for had not materialised.

She said that did not have an agreement on 'any part' of the case.

Mr Bronstein said that Ritchie and Madonna had been speaking directly to each other and by yesterday had drawn up an agreement which they had summarized into 24 points.

It broke down because of a number of issues including measures that allowed David Banda, the son Madonna adopted while married to Ritchie, to visit Rocco in London but make sure he returns to New York.

Mr Bronstein said there were still a 'number of differences which are extremely important to my client and, I understand, to the child'.

He went on to say that he had refrained from filing a number of papers which could be 'emotionally disturbing' to Rocco in the hope that an agreement could be reached.

He asked the court to lift Justice Kaplan's order from December requiring that Rocco return to New York but she rebuffed him.

Justice Kaplan told him that under the terms of Madonna and Ritchie's divorce, which was agreed in London in 2008, the Manhattan Supreme Court had ultimate authority over any custody matters, not the High Court in London.

Instead Ritchie has been going to the London court for hearings over the row, the court was told. Another one was due to take place in London on Thursday.

Justice Kaplan urged both sides not to take up what she called 'entrenched' positions and think about what was 'best for the child'.

She said that she thought that both parties were 'coming very very close to a global resolution that would take the child out of the unending spotlight'.

Alter seized on this and said that Ritchie's conduct amounted to contempt. She said: 'He thought it was better for Rocco to live with him.

'He may be right, I don't know. But the proper procedure was to come back to New York and ask for a change in circumstances. He used self-help.

'He taught his son that obeying court orders was not important and I think that's one of the most serious things that's happened in this case that's detrimental to Rocco.'

Mr Bronstein said that the mere suggestion Ritchie could be arrested cast a 'dark pall' over the hearing and said that the boy should be able to live in a 'normal household' with his father present.

Rocco's lawyer Ellen Sigal said that the teenager wanted his parents to 'put in place measures that will heal the rift that has arisen'.

She said that the case was proving to be a 'very difficult' time for him and that that she hoped he would not be exposed to any more 'distress and innuendo'.

She said that Rocco felt that the case was 'stressful and upsetting'. He is currently attending school in London and that she hoped Rocco's parents 'come to an agreement that will shield him from this matter'.

Madonna appeared by phone from New Zealand where she is due to play the next date in her Rebel Heart tour. Ritchie's location was not disclosed but is likely to have been London.

She spoke only at the start of hearing when asked: 'Is that Miss Ciccone?' and she replied: 'Yes, it's me.'

Ritchie only spoke to confirm he was on the phone too.

Earlier Justice Kaplan had agreed to let the press remain in the court because she did not believe that coverage of the case would cause a 'negative impact' to Rocco.

She said that the case had attracted 'extraordinary' media attention and that she had to balance the need for public access with the 'harmful effects' on Rocco.

The judge also allowed a single photographer in to take still photos of the hearing.

The case is to resume on 1 June.

The couple were married in Skibo Castle in Scotland in a high profile ceremony attended by Gwyneth Paltrow, Donatella Versace and Stella McCartney.

Madonna is also the mother to 19-year-old daughter Lourdes Leon, from her previous relationship to Carlos Leon, and adopted children David Banda, 10, and Mercy James, also 10 - David was adopted while she was still married to Guy.

Guy, meanwhile, has gone on to have three children with wife Jacqui Ainsley: sons Rafael, four, and Levi, one, and daughter Rivka, three.

Ritchie had been seen walking in London before the case was heard.

He and his superstar singer ex have been embroiled in a bitter legal battle over their teenager for the past few months.

Madonna has used social media to attempt to appeal to her son.

Two weeks ago she shared a nostalgic snapshot of herself with baby Rocco, reminiscing about happier times.

Along with the snap, she wrote, 'Tu me manque............(sic)', translated as 'I miss you'.

While some of her French fans were quick to point out that she had spelt 'manques' wrong, most of her followers chimed in with messages of love and support, reassuring the star that Rocco would no doubt change his mind.

'Be strong he will come back, he is just a teenager', one posted, while another enthused, 'He will always be your son and you always his mother'.

Rocco is said to have moved in which his father, 47, his model wife Jacqui Ainsley, 34, and their three children after becoming fed up with being on tour with his mother.

He was supposed to spend Christmas with her but did not return home to New York.

Madonna went to the Manhattan Supreme Court in December to try to force Rocco to come home.

But during the hearing Ritchie's lawyer Eric Buckley said that Rocco had 'expressed very clearly' that he did not want to be with her.

One possible source of Rocco's frustration is that Madonna posted numerous pictures and videos of him on Instagram that could have caused him embarrassment.

In May she posted one video of him doing a backflip wearing orange underwear with the caption 'Rocco's preferred profile #nosausage'.

In an interview in August Madonna said that Rocco did not want to perform on stage with her and would be working backstage on her tour as 'your mom is not cool' at his age.

The row has reopened old wounds from her and Guy's divorce after eight years together and put Madonna at the center of a painful and public battle.

Madonna reportedly thinks Guy's parenting is too lax and is said to have hired private detectives to spy on Rocco, who took pictures of him smoking underage.

2555,"Michelle Obama’s Plastic Surgery Scandal!

Her vanity comes before our vets! In a slap in the face to America’s courageous wounded warriors, First Lady MICHELLE OBAMA used Walter Reed Army Medical Center as her own personal outpatient plastic surgery clinic, The National ENQUIRER has learned.

“It’s appalling!” fumed Jill Farrell of Judicial Watch. “With taxpayers picking up the tab for her ski trips to Aspen and beach outings to Hawaii, we might as well pay for her abs and butt, too!”

Michelle was whisked to the hospital with “the utmost secrecy” in the summer of 2011, a source told The ENQUIRER.

“Secret Service agents were stationed both inside and outside the operating room. Michelle had fat sucked from her abdomen, hips and butt.”

While such procedures can take up to two hours, “she was done in 45 minutes to an hour.”

What’s more, the source added, “When elective surgery is done, even if it’s cosmetic, the surgeon’s fee is waived. If Michelle paid anything, it would have been just for the anesthesiologist.

“Because Michelle is First Lady though, I wouldn’t be surprised if the government picked up the total tab, meaning taxpayers forked over their hard-earned dollars to satisfy her vanity!”

The ENQUIRER has also learned Michelle, 51, has likely had more than just liposuction at such military facilities.

We asked a panel of top plastic surgeons to analyze before-and-after photos of the First Lady, and each agreed the mother of two has undergone a so-called “liquid facelift” with Botox and filler injections, plus a nose job!

“A little Botox helps to smooth out those forehead lines earned during the last campaign,” theorized Dr. Lyle Back. “I can [also] see the rhinoplasty work she had done is very obvious. It is superb, sophisticated work, though.”

Dr. Otto Placik said Michelle now has fewer crow’s feet, indicating she’s had “definite Botox,” as well as a Hollywood-ready smile.

He added: “Her lips are fuller, indicating fillers into both upper and lower lips. Besides that, her marionette lines [running down from the corners of her mouth] are almost completely gone.”

Respected plastic surgeon Dr. Steven Dayan added: “She has a decrease in the height of her smile, which can happen when a lot of filler is placed in the cheeks and smile lines.”

The experts’ conclusions further incensed Jill, who charged: “Michelle Obama is taking up needed space while veterans are awaiting care and suffering. It’s a crying shame!”

Kendall Jenner is standing by her man.

On Saturday, the 22-year-old was spotted cheering on her new beau Blake Griffin, 28, at the Staple Center in Los Angeles.

Jenner mostly kept her outfit casual, wearing a baggy white turtleneck and distressed denim jeans. She topped the look of with a pair of $10,000 Saint Laurent knee-high boots, though— the same covetable shoes she wore during her birthday dinner on Thursday.

The crystal-embroidered chunky-heeled footwear—which debuted on Saint Laurent’s AW17 catwalk — have already been worn by Celine Dion, Kim Zolciak-Biermann and Rihanna, and help ensure that wherever she goes, all eyes are on Jenner.

Amid claims that things are getting more serious between Kendall and Griffin, the Los Angeles Clippers star also joined Jenner’s family at her birthday dinner at Petit Taqueria on Thursday night.

“Kendall was in a great mood,” an onlooker told PEOPLE of the supermodel. “She and Blake hung out, but they also mingled separately.”

Another source added: “Kendall is very happy with Blake. They started out more like friends, and then it was very casual. But it seems more serious lately. When they are not together, they keep in touch over the phone. Her family has accepted Blake. They are spending time getting to know him.”

To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, """"A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others."""" The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.

I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a """"rodeo cowboy"""" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd.

So they went from being anti-drug to pro-drug. The modern BNP has no links to Holocaust denial. Secondly, the comment about Nick Griffin and the RAF bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by anti-BNPer's.

But, Taylor Swift is now dating relatively unknown actor, Joe Alwyn, who has yet to see big-screen success, and fans are wondering if it’s true or false news that she is spending millions of dollars supporting the relationship. His first film, “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” garnered him good reviews from critics, but not much of a paycheck. In fact, Joe has admitted to still living at home with his parents in London.

Taylor Swift met Joe Alwyn last fall through mutual friends and decided to move to London in order to be closer to the struggling actor. She rented a beautiful home in North London close to where Joe’s parents lived. Home rentals in London are some of the most expensive in the world, with some claiming a London rental can cost twice as much as renting elsewhere, but Taylor thought Joe was worth it and signed a six month lease so the two could be together.

Now comes word that she is yet again willing to drop a ton of cash for the actor. Taylor is reportedly shopping for a home for the two of them to share in London’s affluent Chelsea neighborhood. Money is no object and she is willing to pay millions to live in the wealthy neighborhood which other famous Brits, including Pippa Middleton call home.

Although she and Joe will be spending the majority of their time at her house in Los Angeles so he can work on future film roles, Joe is very close to his parents and wants a home close to them so he can visit often and Taylor is willing to make that happen.

It’s not only real-estate that the Grammy winner is willing to spend money on when it comes to her new love. Taylor and Joe have been traveling using her private jets , and just this weekend, the two were seen boarding her private plane in London. The pair first flew to LA to let Joe get settled in Taylor’s home and then the couple headed to Nashville so her new beau could meet her parents.

While it’s true that Taylor Swift apparently doesn’t mind spending millions of dollars on Joe Alwyn, some of the singer’s own fans are starting to feel embarrassed that the pop star is the one footing all the bills and are wondering if a relationship will work out between the two in the long run. Others are just are hoping that with this move to Los Angeles, other movie offers will come in and his career will finally start to take off. Come back to CDL for all your Taylor Swift news and updates.

Hey, how's it goin' Ginkgo100? I had a couple ideas I wanted to bounce off another editor to see what they thought: you’re the editor. Here's what’s going on in my head:

First; I was looking at the Bill Ritter (politician) article a little while ago and thinking it was a little dull. You scored that good shot of Ritter at the CDC, and that's about all the color we've got. So, I stopped by Ritter's campaign site (http://www.ritterforgovernor.com) and found a great screenshot off KUSA of the latest poll numbers (drop by and take a look if you can). I thought maybe this might be worth uploading (if applicable; didn't check yet) and using in the Ritter article and Colorado gubernatorial election, 2006. What do you think?

In a related thought, I stumbled upon the video of the Ritter/Beauprez debates from Aug. 11 (Here's a link ). Other articles I've read have contained video, but this one might be a little to long (any thoughts?) and may not be material appropriate or applicable to upload onto Wikipedia.

Second, I'm going to plunge into a clean-up effort that looks a little challenging over at National Western Stock Show (take a look and you'll see what I mean). If you can, and you like what's one of my favorite events in Denver, drop by the article and help me out a little.

Thanks for the help; I've written a lot here, my apologies. See ya' around, have a good one.",0

2507,"'Dancing With The Stars': Donald Trump Asked To Star In Show & He Hasn't Said No

What the heck?! Donald Trump seems pretty busy on the campaign trail, but he's been invited to take some time off to try his hand (or feet?) at dancing! Apparently Dancing with the Stars has asked Donald to join the Season 23 cast!

""They really want someone political on the show, especially this season being so close to the election,"" a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. ""They have always wanted Bill Clinton and will obviously never get him but they always ask. And they asked Donald Trump to see if he would be interested to do the show even while running for President.""

But why is Donald such a hot ticket for the show? ""They would have loved this season to grab him for many reasons especially coming off of a season with his ex Marla Maples being on the show,"" the insider explained. ""But they haven't got a response and always expected a ""No."" In the producer's eyes it was worth asking."" Well he hasn't said no yet so there may still be a glimmer of hope!

If there were concerns about no one wanting to dance with Ryan Lochte because of fan backlash, we can't imagine how hard it would be for Donald to find a willing partner. The Republican nominee comes up with a new hateful message each week getting Democrats angrier and angrier at him. However, on Aug. 24 he seemed to be softening his immigration stance on Hannity, so maybe he would do this to become more likable? We'll just have to see when the full cast list comes out!

2632,"Tyra Banks Sued for Causing 'Emotional Distress' During ‘America’s Got Talent’ Taping

*A contestant on “America’s Got Talent” says her performance at a recent taping was roasted so viciously by new host Tyra Banks that it has caused emotional distress to her young daughter, who was watching from the wings.

The woman, identified in the filing as Jane Doe, filed a lawsuit against Banks on Tuesday in L.A. Superior Court accusing the former model of battery and assault, and seeking damages for infliction of emotional distress, reports Variety.

Jane Doe says she and her husband were performing an ode to their daughter, identified as Mary, during a taping on March 19. Once they finished, the woman says that she and her husband were “humiliated” by the judges and the audience, who criticized the song.

According to the suit, Banks added to the humiliation by making fun of the song in front of Mary. Jane Doe alleges that Banks pulled her daughter’s hair back, physically manipulated her, and insinuated that the girl was accidentally conceived.

Afterward, “Mary was traumatized and became deeply depressed,” the suit states. “Mary would become extremely nervous and anxious whenever, among other triggering events, she hears any mentions of [the] song and [the] song itself, whenever she ruminates about the events during or related to the performance, and whenever she thinks about the prospective televised airing or use online of Jane Doe and her husband, their performance, as well as the airing and use online of any footages of Mary.”

Reality show contestants typically sign waivers acknowledging that they may be subjected to ridicule and humiliation. However, the suit alleges that Marathon Productions got Mary to sign a contract without her parents’ knowledge or consent, according to Variety.

After the contestant complained, the company communicated that it would not feature Mary in the broadcast. However, the couple asked that the entire performance not be aired. That request was refused.

2423,"'Jealous' Kim Tries To Steal Beyonce's Baby Spotlight

While the Bey Hive was buzzing yesterday about Beyonce's shocking baby news, RadarOnline.com has learned that Kim Kardashian was busy with her own plan to steal back the spotlight!

""Kim was shocked at the Beyonce news and she was totally checking it out and seeing how many people like the post,"" an insider told Radar. ""Then when her friend Chrissy Teigen started Tweeting that she was best friends with Beyonce, she was actually hurt and worried.""

As Radar has reported, there is a longstanding rivalry between Queen Bey and Kardashian, 36, and according to an insider, Kardashian is not letting it go anytime soon!

""That's why she started Tweeting,"" the source told Radar. ""She thinks she's a bigger star than Beyonce. She is the biggest star in the world."" And it was time to remind her fans.

The first attempt came right after Beyonce announced the news. Kardashian took to her Twitter to share with her fans that she had finally updated her app, Kim Kardashian Hollywood!

""Had to change up my look in #KimKardashianGame! Have you guys seen the latest update? @KKHOfficial,"" Kardashian wrote on Twitter.

Seeing that had not done anything to put a dent in Beyonce's big news, the KUWTK wife of Yeezy rapper, Kanye West, tried yet again – by announcing that she and pal, Chrissy Tiegen, were starting their own book club.

""So guys..... @chrissyteigen & @jenatkinhair & I are starting a book club!,"" Kardashian posted. Sadly, no massive celebrations erupted like she was hoping.

But that's not all! Earlier in the day, Kardashian misled fans to believe that she and West, 39, were ALSO expecting another child together. When a fan asked it it were true, however, Kardashian quickly shot it down.

""While everyone was tweeting and sending congratulations to Beyonce and Jay Z, Kim and Kanye did not say one word about it on their social media,"" the source told Radar.

""The fact that Beyonce is going to have more kids than Kim once her twins are born absolutely drives Kim nuts!""

""Kim was totally trying to steal Beyonce's baby thunder yesterday.""

As Radar reported, Kardashian and West – like Beyonce and Jay Z – hit several rough patches in their superstar union this year, leading many to believe that the two were headed for a messy divorce.

But it seems that one sure-fire way to get over a slump is by getting another baby bump!

""Kim is going to try harder than ever right now to get pregnant because she is constantly searching for a way to one up Beyonce,"" the insider claimed. ""She seems so jealous that Beyonce is more famous than she is. It doesn't seem like Kim will ever, be okay with that.""

Do you think that Kim Kardashian should get pregnant so that she can have as many children as Beyonce has? Tell us your thoughts below.

2776,"Selena Gomez gushes over Jenifer Aniston at Cake party

Selena Gomez may be one of the biggest household names in the world, but even she fangirls over her favourite actresses.

And she got to meet one of her heroes, Jennifer Aniston, 45, at a party to celebrate the Friends star's new film Cake in Los Angeles on Friday night.

Selena, 22, and Jennifer certainly seemed to get on well as they hugged in a photo taken after a special screening of the movie at Directors Guild Of America.

Both actresses wore black to the party hosted by Perrier-Jouet And Cinelou Films at Chateau Marmont's Bar, and Selena made sure to get a picture for her Instagram account.

The Spring Breakers star wrote: 'I have not only been following her career as a fan since I was 8 and now get to watch her completely transform in her new movie CAKE, I have gotten to have real conversations with such a real heart, made my entire year. #cake #goseeit'

Aniston's new film has certainly drummed up some Oscar buzz for the actress known more for her comedy work than dramatic.

In the film she plays a woman who suffers from chronic pain and after seeing visions of a member of her support group who committed suicide, seeks out the dead woman's husband.

The film features a stellar ensemble cast including Anna Kendrick, Sam Worthington, William H. Macy, Felicity Huffman and Mamie Gummer (daughter of Meryl Streep).

The Oscar talk hasn't been too comfortable for Jennifer, who told the New York Post's Confidenti@l: that the praise is 'awkward and I'm flattered and humbled.'

Speaking of her transformation into the scarred Claire Simmons, the actress said: 'I gave myself about six weeks to really just disappear and connect with (the character) and this trauma, which is unthinkable.

'And I was just so excited and I ticked all the boxes in the actor dream role.'

Cake is out in US cinemas for a limited release this December but will go nationwide in January 2015 and in the UK on 20 February

2843,"Chris Pratt Is The Latest Star To Join Star-Studded Hillsong Church

Justin Bieber may have a new pal at Bible study. According to Entertainment Tonight, Chris Pratt was spotted at the Los Angeles parish of Hillsong Church, a hotspot that's frequented by Bieber and Kourtney Kardashian.
This is only the second Pratt sighting since the Guardians of the Galaxy star and his wife, Anna Faris, announced their separation after being married for eight years. Last month, Pratt made an appearance at the Teen Choice Awards, sans Faris, to accept the surfboard trophy for Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actor.
While ET doesn't mention whether or not the stars mingled or even knew that they were in the same congregation, Pratt attended the same evening service as both Bieber and Kardashian that night.
ADVERTISEMENT

For those unfamiliar with the mega church that is Hillsong, it's an Australian import and its pastor, Carl Lentz, is one of Bieber's closest confidants. In addition to having services in Australia, the church has expanded with branches in New York City, Los Angeles, and London. Stars are flocking to the church and its parishioners include a slew of reality stars, such as the Kardashian-Jenner sisters; Nick Jonas; Bieber's ex, Selena Gomez; and pro athletes such as Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.

According to People, Pratt ""redefined"" his connection to Christianity after the birth of his son, Jack, in 2012. He told the publication that he and Faris prayed extensively during Jack's time in the NICU, since he was born nine weeks premature. Back in 2016, Pratt helped his pals place a huge cross on their property in Texas, telling Stephen Colbert on The Late Show that it was ""what Jesus was doing 2000-something years before on a Saturday before Easter, [he] was carrying a cross up a hill.""

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

At long last, Lindsay Lohan has found love. 

The ""Mean Girls"" actress is reportedly engaged to Russian heir Egor Tarabasov, according to a TMZ report. It's rumored that the 29-year-old actress and 22-year-old heir began dating sometime in 2015.

Lohan, who appears to have been living in London after doing a play there, occasionally posts photographs of her beau on Instagram

So, is this for real or is it all just a rumor? We'll let Lindsay's 2004 hit do the singing talking for us.

Orton = Does whatever the fuck he wants because he is a main star and friends with Triple H. Should have been fired already for smoking pot in front of everyone. If it wasn't for Triple H, he would be jobbing in TNA right now. Fuck him, that son of a bitch does not deserve the spot he has. He is good of the mic but ring skills lack, headlock after headlock. They compare him to AJ Styles which is a joke in my opinion since AJ has pure wrestling ability.

Triple = Been playing politics for years and deserves to become a jobber for the people he has buried. He tried to keep Booker T and Kurt Angle down. Angle is one of the best wrestlers and if you watch his match with Abyss at Turning Point; which I can give you a link, it is worth the watch trust me; is still doing great things.

2732,"Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux Made One ""Massive Miscalculation"" While Planning Their Secret Wedding

Uncomfortable seating aside, it sounded as though Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's secret wedding, this summer, went off without a hitch. Incredibly, details about the Malibu nuptials were not leaked to press. Jimmy Kimmel did a ""beautiful"" job ordaining the ceremony, finding the perfect balance between sweet and funny. Howard Stern gave a speech. And afterward, the newlyweds embarked on the fanciest group honeymoon of which we've ever heard. But on Wednesday, while promoting the new season of HBO's The Leftovers, Theroux revealed that the duo did make one ""massive miscalculation"" when planning the wedding.

Theroux explained that, to keep the wedding below-the-radar, he and Aniston told different guests different reasons why they were throwing a party at their house this past August. Initially, they told most guests it was a birthday celebration for Theroux. But when certain people R.S.V.P.'d no because of busy schedules, the couple felt the need to spill the secret to entice them to be there on the special day. Of course, that meant that the in-the-know guests were dressed like they were attending a wedding, while the rest were in jeans and flip flops, so that each guest could easily tell who had been trusted with the secret and who hadn't.

""It was actually a massive miscalculation,"" Theroux said of their wedding plan. ""Afterwards, we kind of realized, like, that was a terrible plan, because you're basically telling half your guests, 'You're unemployed and we can't trust you,' which was of course not the case, but we just kind of put it out there, and people that said yes to the birthday [we didn't tell], and then people who said, 'We can't,' we really put more pressure on them to be at the 'birthday.'""

And then, of course, there were also the friends who, during Theroux and Aniston's engagement, just got into the habit of dressing in formal wear each time they were invited to the couple's home in the off-chance that the get-together would turn out to be the couple's much-anticipated wedding.

""We also have friends who, when we've done barbecues and stuff, show up, like, dressed to the nines, like, 'This is the thing, right?,'"" Theroux said. ""And we're like, 'No, this is actually just a barbecue.'""

On a happier note, though, Theroux said he is relishing the fact that he is finally able to call Aniston his wife. ""The first couple days of doing it-it's a great feeling.""

OK, no reordering. But can we give them designations, like this? I'm calling it """"List A"""" so we can start a new list later without confusion. If you don't like it we'll work something else out, but we really need some way to refer to issues without saying, """"Hey, getting back to that thing we were talking about, the bit where it says that Gage was traveling, not the bit about the time when he blah blah blah.""""

One point: we absolutely cannot refer to """"Note X"""" and """"Ref 22"""" and so on. These designations shift around as the article is edited and we will go completely crazy. In the below, I've substituted permalinks instead. 

Issues list """"A""""

A1 Background
A1a """"He may have gained skill with explosives on his family's farms or in nearby mines and quarries..."""" Speculation from Macmillan. Attribute it.
A1b Gage's date of birth in the infobox is not covered here when it should be covered and noted in proper context of its sourcing.

A2 Gage's accident
A2a Does not address numerous theories presented or Gage's actions prior to accident. EEng knows all too well this subject. I think Ratiu and Van Horn's material needs to be pointed out because the evidence shows that Gage had his mouth open and was speaking at the time the rod passed through his skull. I do not know why this is absent. I have issues with the section, but I'll hold off on the excessive quoting and measurement issues for now.

A3 Subsequent life and travels
A3a """"bt. February he was able to do a little work abt. ye horses & barn, feedg. ye cattle &c; that as ye time for ploughing came he was able to do half a days work after that & bore it well."""" - Paraphrase.
A3b  Would Gage's mental impairment belong here? I think it would be helpful.
A3c  Missing Gage's time in New Hampshire prior to Chile.
A3d  Chile and California is missing the account of Gage's doctor and missing some other tidbits, not too bad - but everything related to his mental improvement and the regaining of normalcy in his life is absent without reason.
A3e This is also the key section that Macmillan's research becomes quite useful as a case argument.

A4 Death and subsequent travels
A4a  Still glaringly missing the details surrounding his return home, illness and death. 
A4b Also, the exhumation details - which was in Fleischman's book - is entirely absent. This little episode in the Gage story is something which is important. 

A5 Other matters
A5a Analysis and actual examination of the claims and details surrounding Gage and his role in science has been well- mostly avoided by the article. Instead of proper detailing of the injury and Gage's role in history. 
A5b Only a few hundred words on Gage's mental impairments were written yet lengthy quotes are used.
A5c Using """"passim"""" and other issues in citing Macmillan is also a cop-out and would merit a verifiability failure.
A5d Not even that, it doesn't even credit Macmillan when it should.

A6 Notes
A6a A substantial part of the text is hidden away in these notes. These complex, rambling, and citation filled messes that only make verification more tedious.
A6b A note like  which reads """" See Macmillan & Lena;[34]:9 Harlow;[12]:332,345 Bigelow;[11]:16–17 Harlow;[9]:390 Macmillan.[1]:86"""" is just improper.
A6c  Note  - """"Macmillan's book provides one of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary ... the definitive account ...""""[57]"""" - is just the type of note we do not need.

A3c For Gage's time in New Hampshire, didn't he spent 18 months in a horse stable?

The article says
Gage subsequently worked for the owner of a livery and coach service in Hanover, New Hampshire
Harlow says this began sometime in 1851 and, """"He remained there, without any interruption from ill health, for nearly or quite a year and a half."""" This fits with JMH's (JHM = John Martyn Harlow) information that PG went to Chile in August 1852. How about if we change it to 
For about eighteen months he worked for the owner of a livery and coach service in Hanover, New Hampshire
Thoughts?   

A4a missing details surrounding return home, illness and death

""""but he was in Chile for about 7 years, correct? Then he returned and rested for awhile before becoming a farm laborer - I'm not sure if this is on one or several farms, but wasn't the convulsions following a day's labor on the farm? The seizures",0

2892,"This is how Kate Middleton is redecorating Kensington Palace

It was announced in January that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be moving to London later this year, settling in the capital for the long term from Autumn.

With the Duke and Duchess planning to take on more royal engagements and Prince George, 3, due to start school at Thomas’s London Day School in Battersea from September, a move for the family of four made sense.

Announcing the news, they released an official statement: ‘Their Royal Highnesses love their time in Norfolk and it will continue to be their home. From this autumn, however, the Duke and Duchess will increasingly base their family at Kensington Palace. As they have in recent years, their royal Highnesses are keen to continue to increase their official work on behalf of the Queen and for the charities and causes they support, which will require greater time spent in London.’

With the move scheduled to take place in the coming months, it comes as no surprise that the Duke and Duchess are already starting to make Kensington Palace ready for the family or four (plus Lupo the cocker spaniel).

Having renovated the palace a few years back in a £1 million revamp, Kate Middleton is said to be enlisting the help of interior designer to the stars, Ben Pentreath, to help give the palace a more homely vibe.

The designer, who helped decorate her Norfolk home, Amner Hall, and who boasts a star-studded client list from Liv Tyler to Sarah Jessica Parker, is said to be helping Kate to decorate and furnish apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, giving it a traditional and luxurious feel.

According to Hello! magazine, the Duchess has gone for a neutral colour palette, decorating her drawing room with traditional furnishings from long floor-length curtains, plants and tapestry rugs, to cream lamps and gold framed artwork. There’s also said to be a few modern additions, including an octagonal coffee table and some fluffy cushions.

We’re getting some serious interiors envy already – If you’ll excuse us we’re off to buy some cream lamps and fluffy cushions.

2558,"Expectant Kylie Jenner Is An ‘Emotional Wreck’ While In Hiding, Source Reveals – ‘She Feels So Alone!’

What’s even worse is that her only real help, matriarch Kris Jenner doesn’t really have the time to deal with her youngest daughter’s drama. According to new reports, the stress of having to keep her pregnancy under wraps has been taking a toll on 20-year-old Kylie Jenner.

‘Honestly, Kylie is just an emotional wreck right now. She doesn’t know what to do or who to trust, and she’s just so vulnerable right now,’ one source close to the Kardashians revealed.

The young makeup mogul’s life inexperience in the face of such a huge change may be to blame for her meltdown.

The insider assured us that Kylie, who is expecting her first baby with boyfriend Travis Scott, is much more scared than what she lets the fans see.

‘She doesn’t know how to be an adult, let alone a mother. She is feeling so alone!’ the source added.

And while Kylie has been craving her mom’s care and help through this confusing change, Kris is reportedly way too busy to give Kylie the attention she needs.

In addition, Kris was planning to offer her youngest daughter a big spin-off show about her life as a young mother as well as an awesome pregnancy reveal but Kylie is getting way too impatient of staying hidden after so many years of enjoying the spotlight.

‘Kylie’s just tired of being in hiding. She hates that she has to keep it a big secret for Kris. It has created a lot of tension between the two of them and there was already a lot of tension, to begin with,’ the spy dished.

2879,"Zayn on Taylor Swift: ""I Think She Deserves Her Success""

Former One Direction member and perennial pop heartthrob Zayn Malik is notoriously guarded. But in an interview with The Fader following the release of his new single with Sia “Dusk Till Dawn,” he did offer up a positive review of fellow pop star Taylor Swift, with whom he collaborated on the chart-topping single “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” in late 2016.

“I rate her as an artist, I think she’s cool, I think she’s successful, and I think she deserves her success because she’s worked hard,” Malik said about Swift. “That’s just how I look at it. I did a song with her, it was fun, she was professional.”

Malik also noted that Swift is more than just a one-off collaborator and professional contact: his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid, is famously part of Swift’s squad. “She gets on with my girlfriend, they’re good friends,” he noted. “I don’t have a bad word to say about her. She’s cool.” (He did not comment on her most recent music.)

In general, Malik seems thoroughly nonplussed by media attention and the hullabaloo around both his own activities or those of other celebrities in the pop sphere. “I don’t pay too much attention to what people even say about me. I just tend to take it for what it is when I meet them people in real life and have a conversation with them. If they’re cool with me, then I base my relationship on that,” he said.

 Recap 

I decided to withhold further comment until I had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. I am delaying a trip this morning so that I can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.

Your supporting statement for deletion is as follows: 

""""The result was Delete. The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm, and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted. The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic, and I have counted those opinions as being from User:Julie Dancer. Kevin (talk) """"

As for """"The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm..."""" 
In reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance.  Within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by  at  that other algorithms exist, namely Examples of relevant works are """"A Fast, Bottom-Up Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with Near-Optimal Generalization"""" and """"An Efficient Algorithm For Optimal Pruning Of Decision Trees"""". which are capable of performing the function the article title names:

If this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.

In anticipation of these other algorithms being added I immediately changed the body of the text to read """"The algorithm used for this purpose..."""" to """"One algorithm used for this purpose..."""" Since I do not now have access to the article's history as the result of your deletion I can not give you the exact date and time. However, it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. (Incidentally, it has been suggested by a Professor at Cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.)

Normally as a Wikipedia user I would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the Wikipedia was setup this way. The Wikipedia still claims to be """"...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.""""  

The impression I have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. They simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the Wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. Instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection, especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. 

As for """"...references not supporting the notability of the subject"""" 
You can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like """"Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted."""" All of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which I deferred. Just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. I know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.

As for """"The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic... 
This shows you did not read or comprehend the response I made in the deletion discussion or only scanned it. I explained that each of the user names were created so that I could track the use of my own resources better, similar to the need on the part of the Wikipedia to require bots to have their own user name even though several may be owned by the same user. Eventually at least one of my computes will be used to accommodate bots, but currently I am able to meet all of my needs by downloading the Wikipedia and mining it off line.

Since the existence of the alternate user names was stated and known by all from the beginning of the deletion discussion there is no w",0

Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn are currently doing the private relationship thing: They haven’t stepped out in public together and the only way Swift has talked about her British boyfriend of almost a year is through song (""…Ready For It?"" and ""Gorgeous,"" according to fans). But Us Weekly has a report on how things are going for the two these days. Alwyn and Swift are “very much in love,” a source told the outlet.

“They have quite a low-key relationship, which Taylor likes. It’s very normal, and no one really knows about it right now. They just work out, watch movies together and invite friends over. Taylor loves to cook and bake for him. They are still taking it slow.”

2575,"Kevin Hart Begs Wife Eniko Parrish For Forgiveness With $250000 Push Gift

Kevin Hart is telling himself — nothing says “I am sorry for cheating and humiliating you” like a $250,000 gift.

If the latest rumors are accurate, Hart feels bad for his pregnant wife, Eniko Parrish, after getting caught in a sex scandal with stripper and singer Montia Sabbag and is, therefore, willing to spend a small fortune on a lavish baby shower and a push present.

A friend of the comedian told a popular publication that he is going to shower the woman carrying his baby with diamonds to show how committed he is to their marriage.

The person told the media outlet: “Kevin [Hart] is planning the ultimate push present to give to his wife, Eniko [Parrish]. He has not picked it out yet, but he has decided that it is going to be very expensive and have lots of diamonds. He wants this present to be a symbol of his love and commitment to Eniko and their new baby. Kevin asked his assistant to help pick out a super bling ring, necklace, or something classy out for Eniko in the $250k price range. Kevin is determined to prove to Eniko that he loves her and wants their relationship to last.”

Another insider claimed that Hart has nothing to worry about because while his wife is hurt, she is deep in the third trimester, and has no plans to raise a baby alone.

The source explained: “Eniko is hurt and angry, but she is nowhere near ready to walk away. She simply can‘t imagine her life without Kevin. He is her world, and it has been that way since she was 23 years old. Throwing it all away over one mistake is just not something she can do right now.”

The pal shared that Parrish is focused living a stress-free life and having a healthy baby.

The friend revealed: “Leaving him is not even a question, she is in her third trimester and already thinking like a mamma bear. Her child’s needs come first. And right now Eniko knows she needs to stay as calm and centered as possible. Breaking up with Kevin right now is only going to put more stress on her.”

Some commenters say that Hart should be honest with himself and start an open marriage if that is not already the case.

2714,"Two ""Dads"" Mentored Bay

Adopted as a baby, Michael Bay began searching for his birth parents when he was a young man. He found his biological mother and for a time his search for his biological father pointed to no less than John Frankenheimer, the auteur director of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and other Hollywood classics.

Gene tests later proved Bay was not Frankenheimer's son, and the trail went cold. But in his career, Bay has two ""dads"" who share his creative DNA: Jerry Bruckheimer and Steven Spielberg.

Having such hitmakers as his guides has served Bay well, and he's repaid their support handsomely. Bruckheimer served as a producer on Bay's first five films, including such hits as ""Bad Boys,"" ""The Rock"" and ""Armageddon,"" and Spielberg produced his last three, the ""Transformers"" pics. The franchise has already grossed more than $1.5 billion worldwide between the first two films, with the latest sequel expected to break box office records this weekend.

His one feature that had neither as producer, ""The Island,"" is Bay's lowest-grossing picture. (Though since DreamWorks released the film, Spielberg was involved in some capacity.)

Bruckheimer shepherded Bay into feature films in the mid '90s, but their relationship goes back more than 20 years. ""I saw Michael's commercial reel and thought that he had a combination of an amazing sense of humor and a great sense of visual style,"" Bruckheimer says. ""Michael did a very good video for us on 'Days of Thunder.' Even though he had only done a couple of videos at that point, it was easy to see how talented he was.""

Bruckheimer expected Bay to become a big event filmmaker, he says, ""because Michael had such strong vision and the will to get it on camera.""

Bruckheimer describes Bay as ""a born filmmaker,"" though the producer did work with the director to develop his ""clarity of storytelling and depth of the films' characters.""

Spielberg fills a different role than Bruckheimer in guiding Bay, since he's a director himself. Spielberg emerged from TV and the twilight of the studio system to direct blockbusters before tackling more serious pics. There are hints he sees some of himself in Bay.

He says since he started working with Bay on the ""Transformers"" pics, ""I think our relationship has gotten looser over time, in the sense that we laugh a lot more about how hard movies like 'Transformers' are to mount and make. I really believe that once the 'Transformers' franchise is out of his system, Michael will take his visual gifts and begin to apply them to many different kinds of stories, even quiet ones.""

Spielberg notes that while Bay is ""a powerful and provocative image maker,"" on this latest ""Transformers"" pic, ""Michael was very focused on telling a story more character-dependent than 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.' ""

Bruckheimer offers this summary of why Bay's blockbusters consistently shine at the box office.

""Michael likes taking huge audiences, packing them into a Howitzer of his own design, and firing them into the experience,"" Spielberg says. ""There are millions of people who love the thrill rides that Michael designs for them.""

 Lead 

What's there now is not a summary... summaries are supposed to be substantially shorter than the text they summarize, which the case at Salvatore Giunta is not. It simply copies whole sentances from the body text. As an editor, we have to assess the article as it currently stands, and not any hypothetical future stance. If the article grows, then the lead can be adjusted accordingly. In any case, the lead section I favored does indeed summarize the most important part: the MOH.
In any case, did you read WP:LEAD? The lead of a biography is not necessarily supposed to summarize the life story of the subject, but assert thier claim to notability. The two sentances I favored more than do that without being overly repetitive. ''''''wordsdeeds """,0

2891,"Mehgan James Speaks Out On Rob Kardashian Dating Rumors

Has Rob Kardashian found a new boo in Bad Girls Club alum Mehgan James? Media outlets began reporting last week that Rob and Mehgan were in the ""early stages"" in their relationship, with an anonymous insider telling In Touch, ""Rob's been seeing Mehgan James for almost three months, and most of the Kardashians are very upset about it because Mehgan is known for being out of control and volatile. The Kardashians want Rob to find a woman who is kind and calm.""

Shortly after the story began to gain traction, Rob denied even knowing who Mehgan was, writing on social media, ""Wait reading online about some chick I'm dating Megan something. Not true never even met her or heard of her before.""

After retweeting Rob's Twitter statement, Mehgan later addressed the rumors on her Instagram page, writing, ""Before any of you start defaming my character, I'm CLEARLY not dating Rob, nor have I ever confirmed that I was. You all just so happen to believe everything you read.""

""I posted one pair of Arthur George socks 2/3 weeks ago & now all of a sudden I'm a homewrecker, a fraud, a hoe,"" she continued. ""I do not control the media, BUT we all know who has the media on their payroll. Sooo... don't point any fingers this way!""

""I'm just 'Megan something,' that most of you never heard of,"" she went on, referencing Rob's tweet. ""I don't have that type of power. I was just as confused as everyone else and was told not to even entertain it.""

But here's where it gets interesting. TMZ reports that James was actually the one behind the rumors. According to their sources, Mehgan's team leaked the story to the press in the hopes of building her following.

Mehgan then slammed that story on Instagram too, writing, ""I did not fake anything. Like I said I never confirmed that I was dating Rob. Any one that asked I told them it was not true. AND not to mention, the media is trying to make me look like the villain here when THEY are the ones who pieced together a story with no receipts. It takes two people to fake a relationship, any one who fakes a relationship by themselves is a complete idiot!!""

Take a look at Mehgan's full response below.

2545,"Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Come Out As an Item, After 'Tom Cruise Ban' Expires

Now here’s something to really jump up and down on the couch for.

Hollywood’s worst-kept romantic secret—the relationship between Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes—is finally out of the bag, after the couple was photographed walking hand in hand on the beach in Malibu on Labor Day, wearing matching fedoras no less.

They have repeatedly denied they are in a relationship over the past few years, despite incessant rumors and frequent sightings of them together.

Indeed, on one occasion, a friend of the couple, apparently unaware of the omerta, accidentally mentioned their relationship to media outlets, only to issue a hasty retraction.

The absurd level of secrecy, and their public appearance together this week, looks set to give credence to an extraordinary rumor first reported by the gossip site RadarOnline.

In September last year, Radar claimed that as part of her divorce settlement from Top Gun star Cruise, Holmes had agreed not to publicly date anyone until five years had passed following the end of her marriage.

“Katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce,” the source claimed.

“She’s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she’s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,” the insider told Radar. “Katie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms—and got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.”

Cruise and Holmes agreed to a divorce settlement in just 10 days, with the pact reportedly stipulating Suri would not have any contact with Cruise’s religion, Scientology.

However, had Holmes broken the rules about “embarrassing” Cruise, she could have lost the money, the source alleged.

If true, that five-year period would have ended in June—which may explain why the couple has now come out.

Remarkably, most observers believe Foxx and Holmes have been together since 2013—about a year after her split from Tom Cruise—when they were photographed dancing together at a charity bash in The Hamptons.

But they have largely avoided being photographed together and consistently denied they are a couple since then.

There have been a few slips; for example, Katie was seen with a ring on her finger in March 2016, but Foxx’s rep said it wasn’t from him.

It was claimed the two met at each other’s homes and that Katie sometimes disguised herself with wigs and hats to meet up with Foxx without being noticed.

In March 2015, a photo surfaced showing the two stars sitting in a recording studio holding hands.

Jamie is seen reclining in his chair, holding Katie’s hand and gazing at her, with his legs subtly intertwining hers. The actress sat with her legs crossed and staring at her phone, with her foot is resting on one of Jamie’s, while his other foot sneaks around her calf.

Foxx denied reports of romance, insisting the two were “just friends.”

In December 2015, Holmes was a guest at Jamie’s surprise birthday party in New York at La Bilboquet restaurant.

And soon after, she was spotted at The Honor Bar in Beverly Hills with the actor’s youngest daughter, Annalise.

In June 2016, there seemed to be the first public confirmation that Foxx and Holmes were, indeed, in a relationship when former Real Housewives of Atlanta star Claudia Jordan, a friend, said they were dating.

“He is very happy with her. I like that he seems very happy,” Claudia said during an interview for the Allegedly podcast.

However, Jordan quickly retracted, telling Entertainment Tonight the day after the podcast reveal that she had “no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all.”

“I’ve never seen them together. He’s never told me he’s dating her,” she said.

In April this year, a restaurant customer snapped a photo of them having dinner in New York, and in May they were spotted separately boarding the same private jet at Le Bourget Airport in Paris. They were photographed leaving the Park Hyatt Vendome hotel separately.

To make it impossible to get photo evidence that they are together, they traveled “in cars with tinted windows and took secret back elevators,” Us Weekly reported in April.

The couple is said to be exhausted by the need for secrecy, and is doubtless thrilled that the long and allegedly controlling shadow of Tom Cruise will no longer be a presence in their lives.

2896,"Kim Kardashian flips over paparazzi photos showing her in a bikini on vacation: 'I literally don't look like this!'


 In April, Kim Kardashian West went on vacation in Mexico to celebrate her sister Kourtney's birthday. Paparazzi photos of Kim at the beach quickly surfaced online, prompting some people to criticize the reality TV star's cellulite.

A teaser for this week's upcoming episode of ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" shows Kim reacting to the photos after her former assistant and Kardashian West Brands COO Stephanie Shepherd came across them on her phone.

""Oh my god,"" Kim said, as she looked at the photos while lounging by the pool with her friends. ""Like, I don't get it! Like, I literally don't look like this!""

Speaking directly to the camera, the 36-year-old ""KUWTK"" star elaborated on her reaction.

""I'm already having this anxiety attack over security, and I'm already just, like, on high alert and now paparazzi's found us, it's like just the scrutiny that we get all the time, we try to avoid that,"" she said. ""I'm doing all the steps to try to be as private and discreet as possible and then you take pictures. And if they're not, like, perfect people just, like, body-shame you. [...] For people to just think that's OK is so frustrating.""

Kim then goes inside to ""untag"" herself in all the pictures that have been posted.

Watch the clip, which we first saw on E! News, below:

When the photos first appeared, Kim had a very different public reaction to the comments about the photos, sending a body-positive tweet that appeared to rise above the criticism she received.

Although Kim's initial response was celebrated, she was criticized for claiming that the pictures were Photoshopped on ""The View"" in June. In the same interview, she said that the photos encouraged her to start working out more.

""I saw these awful photos of myself when I was on a trip in Mexico and people were Photoshopping them and sharpening them, and they're the worst photos,"" she said during her appearance on the TV show. ""I definitely was not in my best shape. I hadn't worked out in about 12 weeks.""

She continued: ""I was already not feeling like myself and then when people were like sharpening [the photos] and making them look way worse, and then those were going around, I was like 'OK, I'm going to get it together.'""

Of course, Photoshopped or not, cellulite is a totally normal part of a woman's body. As for Kim's reaction to the pictures, we'll have to wait until the next episode of ""KUWTK"" to see more.

""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" airs Sunday's on E! 9 p.m. ET.

While at Harvard College 19-year-old Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly used login data from his social network to hack into fellow students email accounts; that evidence also included instant message transcripts where he calls facebook users """"dumb fucks"""". The alleged following exchange is between a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg and a friend shortly after Mark launched The Facebook in his dorm room:
 
Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard

Zuck: Just ask.

Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS

Jared Leto has his eye on a pretty young thing: 19-year-old Paris Jackson! The duo crossed paths at the Harper’s Bazaar Icons party in NYC on Sept. 8, where the actor, 45, “was definitely making a play for her,” says an insider. “He was staring directly into her eyes while she was talking and they were standing really close. They spoke for a long time and she was laughing a lot.” Still, the Oscar winner struck out, as Paris eventually left to be with her friends — though not before Jared snuck in a kiss on her cheek! Adds the insider: “It was obvious that he was super into her, age difference be damned.”

2621,"Drama On ‘The Voice!’ Kelly Clarkson And Jennifer Hudson “Cannot Stand Each Other”

Behind the scenes, the two divas are feuding! While the finalists of The Voice are getting ready to compete for the grand prize, sources on the set revealed that the real completion is in fact between superstar singers Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson!

As fans of The Voice probably already know, last week, the network announced that Hudson and Clarkson, both 35 years old, have signed contracts to join the vocal competition.

However, the two divas quickly clarified that they would not appear on the same season of the hit show!

Reportedly, we will see Hudson on it sooner, as she is set to coach during season 13, while Clarkson will have to wait until season 14 to show herself.

With that being said, one question, in particular, comes to mind – why can’t they appear on The Voice at the same time?

The answer comes from an on-set source who told us that “Kelly and Jennifer really cannot stand each other!”

“Kelly was completely blindsided when she saw that Jennifer was cast because no one had told her about it,” the insider added.

But even though Hudson and Clarkson are not going to meet on the show, after all, that doesn’t mean the set is safe from the drama.

Considering that Miley Cyrus is set to return for Season 13, the insider revealed that pretty much everyone hopes for some “cattiness” between her and Jennifer Hudson.

“It would be so great!”

What do you think of Jennifer Hudson being added as a vocal coach for season 13? Was she the right choice?

Cruise down to the comment section down below and tell us what your thoughts!

The sisters were also joined by their mom Kris Jenner and longtime friend Jonathan Cheban.

Earlier that day, Kim announced the launch of her kids line collaboration with her husband Kanye West.

The new line includes super cute clothing, that Kim says was inspired by her daughter North.

“#Inspo,” Kim simply captioned a photo of North, wearing a jacket and dress from the line.

2316,"Sure they're subjective - they're rhetorical: I was arguing a case. I still think that the single arrival point (article to which all others direct) should be the most neutral. I believe that that, when dealing with periods in the past, should be assumed to be the title used in the subject's own time (necessarily adjusted for the English language, in an E Lang encyclopedia) - here, Philip the Tetrarch. The Herod Philips have to be there, because people will search for them. These pages should note that there is disagreement about the use of the name and that there is very little firm evidence surviving from that time, and then send the seeker to the historical name. If someone with more knowledge than my own adds a note to the effect that 'Theologians use ... and historians use ...', that would be a welcome addition. This means that all the terms would be in wikipedia; they would all be findable; and there would be a central page which would contain all relevant information, and I trust everything that any user of an encyclopedia might want. I don't want to MOVE any pages, just tidy up the way of finding them. I don't think this is as strong an advice as you do; more of a signpost (perhaps a better image than 'guide'?) In particular, I was astonished, when I began this, by the confusion over HP I & HP II. Evidence for the elder 'Philip' seems minimal.",0

Robert Deegan 
General Liability Claims Section
Los Angeles Unified School District
333 S Beaudry Ave  28th Floor 
Los Angeles CA 90017  

Dear Mr. Deegan:

This letter shall constitute a claim pursuant to the California Tort Claims Act, Section 910 et seq of the California Government Code.

My address information in compliance with Section 910(a) and (b) is set forth above.

Per Section 910(c), (d) and (e), the date of occurrence was October 5, 2007.  I was assaulted and battered by students T and I and possibly other students at Markham Middle School, 145 W 108th Street, Los Angeles.  The Police Report is DR#071828895.

LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.  LAUSD violated my rights under Article I, Section One of the California Constitution to safety and my specific right to safety on a school campus under Article I, Section 28 of the California Constitution.  I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.

David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.

LAUSD’s conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel’s office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.

Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Respectfully Submitted,

 On Mohammed Al-Bayati's qualifications 

With regards to the edits over the past day, I think that while Mohammed Al-Bayati's qualifications are tangentially relevant, the purpose of the text as they are placed right now is to """"prove"""" that Mohammed Al-Bayati is not qualified to review the autopsy report. This I think violates NPOV. If the qualifications are to be included they should come under the """"criticism and controversy"""" section, quoted by whoever it is that accused Mohammed Al-Bayati  of not being qualified to review the autopsy report is cited.

2854,"Blake Lively on Women in Hollywood, Directing and Possible ‘Gossip Girl’ Reunion

As one of Variety’s Power of Women honorees, Blake Lively will attend a lunch on Friday in support of Child Rescue Coalition. For this week’s issue, the actress spoke about women in Hollywood, shooting in New York for “Gossip Girl,” and what she looks for in a role.

There’s been a national conversation recently about gender disparity in Hollywood. Have you experienced that? 

 Yeah, I’ve felt that. It’s hard to complain when there are women who are being sex trafficked, women being treated as objects and product. Yes, it’s important to have that conversation, because equality is equality. I feel fortunate. It’s still to far from what it should be for women in 2017.

It’s important to remember that half the audience of ticket buyers are female. Are you interested in doing tentpoles?

 I don’t look at movies by the budget. I look at movies by the character. What was neat about “The Shallows,” it was really low budget. It was a $17 million movie and we did over $120 million worldwide. It’s cool to do that with a story about a woman. It’s proof people want to see movies about women. It doesn’t all have to be Nicholas Sparks-type films. When you look at a “Star Wars” franchise now versus the “Star Wars” franchise then, there are women at the center.

Do you think there could be a sequel to “The Shallows”?

 I don’t know what would happen. I hope not; I’m not ready to go work out like that again. I’m about to do a movie in a couple months where I’m playing a woman who is a fighter.

Have you started boxing?

 I’m not there yet. I’m getting my back strong.

What speaks to you in a script?

 I look for interesting women. It can be a woman in every frame of the movie or it could be a woman that’s in one scene, but I look for characters that I connect with. Having a family and having worked on a show for six years, it really made me want to do work that I love. And it leads to greater success, which only means more opportunity to do that again.

Would you ever want to direct? 

 I’m really drawn to it. I think I would do it later in life. It’s two years and it becomes your baby. While my kids are young, I wouldn’t want to do that.

Netflix has been rebooting old TV shows. Do you think they could ever do a “Gossip Girl” reunion?

 I don’t know. Why not?

You’d do a grown-up version with the cast? 

 It sort of all depends. Would I do seven years of the show? No, because it’s hard work and I’ve got my babies, and I don’t want to be away from them that much. But I’ve just learned in life you never say never. I’m looking to do something that I haven’t done yet, not something that I did. But would I do that? Who knows — if it was good, if it made sense. We had so much fun shooting and living and working in New York City.

The show glamorized Manhattan for a post-“Sex and the City” generation.

 Josh [Schwartz] and Stephanie [Savage] refused to do the show in Toronto. They said, “No, New York City is the star of the show.” And so they fought for it to be made in New York. If we would have been in Toronto, I don’t know if we would have made it past our first episode.

I can’t imagine the show being set in a fake New York.

 We were always in the coolest new spots. It was almost like a city guide as well as a fun show to watch. We were one of the first people to be at Sleep No More.

Would you go back to TV?

 For me, it’s about good content. My favorite new things I’ve seen this year have been shows over movies, between “The OA” and “Stranger Things.” I finally watched all of “Game of Thrones” and “Westworld.” I love being an audience member of long-form story telling. I would only want to be in a show that I would want to watch.

2827,"Scarlett Johansson's New Man Has Confirmed They Are Dating

From the editors of HelloGiggles

There’s been word that Saturday Night Live’s Weekend Update host Colin Jost is dating Scarlett Johansson. While Hollywood dating rumors often turn out to be true, we kinda assumed this cool couple might have been a passing phase and we’d never hear of it again.

Turns out, Jost and Johansson are so serious that Johansson was actually going to accompany Jost as his date to the Emmys. Tbh, had they stepped out as a couple, we would have died.

‘She’s wonderful. She’s working, so otherwise, she’d be here,’ Colin told Entertainment Tonight on the Emmys red carpet. ‘She’s pretty cool…It’s hard to have a lot of complaints, she’s pretty awesome.’

Jost explained that they met on the set of SNL.

‘The first time she hosted was the first year I was a writer on the show,’ Colin said. ‘So we’ve kind of known each other since then…she’s the best. I’m very happy, I’m very lucky.’

SNL was nominated for a slew of cast performance awards, plus Outstanding Variety Show (which they won) and Outstanding Writing for a Variety Show, which is why Jost was in attendance.

According to People.com Jost and Johansson were first linked back in May when they were spotted kissing at SNL‘s season finale afterparty.

Johansson separated from her now ex-husband Romain Dauriac last summer after two years of marriage. Jost was most notably linked with actress Rashida Jones (the internet seems to be a bit murky on this relationship but suspects it was sometime around 2013).

Best wishes to Jost and Johansson — hopefully they make it work!

Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... )
First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you.

An interesting comment:  """"Convict leasing isn't the same as slavery where there's ownership and title. However, I would agree that we could amend the lead to read: """"effectively abolished slavery...""""

True there is a difference with chattel slavery and forced prison slave labour. One ended w/ the 13th amendment, and the other was legalised under the 13th amendment (not the Corwin Amendment of 1861). In other words, what would be the legal justification for the prison labour in California, Oregon and other states that practise this form of human rights abuse without the """"involuntary servitude"""" clause? WWhat do you think they were referring to? 

Futhermore, I don't see a problem including this in the article, so long as it is a small reference, and not the focus of the article. As to scholarship, there is reputable work on this, and there is no doubt that starting in 1866 the prison chain gangs were leased to private business, plantations, mines etc for being picked up for the most frivilous charges. Yes they were mostly black. The mortality rate was higher than chattel slavery because they were leased and not owned. Virtual life sentences on absurd charges directed against black people w/ forced labour is slavery, though not chattel. This was systematic and went on until WW2, though today's version is slightly different. Now, some of you asked for refrences and rightly so. Slavery by Another Name by Douglas Blackmon, who is a respected writer & journalist and received the Pulitzer Prize for this book which is on this very topic. That's the point. This is FAR from original research, and there are other scholars who've written about it. Now I haven't edited the article nor will I unless there is some agreement w/ others editors here, but I'd like to know the issue as it is now. How do other editors feel? 

One other thing, American historians do not always agree on things, and I have noticed at least one conspicious neo-Confederate argument in the article (unsourced), though on a different part of the article. So yes it's important to look at historians, but on some topics there's a whole lot of rubbish, particularly w/ slavery issues, so a consensus by historians may never happen, and sadly ideological agendas do exist, and I understand what you blokes mean about good sources. I'd say that keeping this article from vandalism is far more important.  15:00, 18 July""",0

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level. I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces, and then perform fellatio, at an unsatisfactory level, to even myself. The list continues, of course, on and on and on. I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour, and for that I am ashamed. 
So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".
I am sincerely embarassed of my behaviour, and after reflecting I know the inappropriateness of it all. Please accept my apology, and know that whatever your lifestyle, I did not mean for my comments to be taken personally.
Sincerely,
Michelle Rollins""",1

""""NDP-affiliated""""
I added a fact tag to the four-times-reinserted modifier """"NDP-affiliated"""" to the mention of Bill Tieleman; other journalists are not generally singled out by party affiliation/loyalty, nor are publishers such as CanWest (which is widely seen as a propaganda arm of the BC Liberal Party, also one of the party's major financial contributors).  It's not that Tieleman isn't an NDPer, but his credentials go beyond his NDP politicking and he is increasingly a critic of that party, also.  I'm responding partly, also to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christy_Clark&action;=historysubmit&diff;=401129881&oldid;=401095803 this edit by ).  I've puzzled long and hard over my own real-world COI on BC political articles, but I see no reason to recuse myself from participation in BC political arti9cles, though generally I give them as wide a berth as possible; but when I recognize POV political activity/wording, as a responsible Wikipedian I can't not say something about it, or challenge the POVism - and COI/spin edits - when I see them.  My interest here is to prevent Wikipedia from being used as part of any campaign p.r. machine (of any party), and to make sure Wikipedia principles are observed - particularly by party operatives who have no reason to respect Wikipedia guidelines or concepts like WP:NPOV.  In the case of this item about BC Rail, there's lots missing, including the search of the Clark-Marrissen home during the opening of the investigation (and that curious telephone call thelling them the police were coming, and why no warrant was needed....vs. all the other highly suspect/irregular warrants to do with that case).  But there's also lots of other commentators, particularly from smalltown papers or independently syndicated, but also notable bloggers/indepednent reserachers like Sean Holman, Laila Yuile and BC Mary who have similarly spoken out about Clark's involvement in the BC Rail matter and how it weights against her in the eyes of the public, and of the """"informed media"""".  She may have been out of teh way for the HST fracas, and the Big Media have pronounced her """"clean"""" of that - but he Big Media also have maintained a veil of silence over BC Rail.  The current text says that she resigned for family reasons; but it's well-citable  that the timing of her resignation was seen to have to do with the BC Rail affair.  And about the Tieleman thing, unless every time Conservative-affiliated columnists or BC Liberal-affiliated columnists and media outlets are similarly tagged in articles mentioning their opninions and claims (often false), it's not fair to single out Tieleman for this; that's the reason for the cite tag; Tieleman's own byline says only """"Bill Tieleman is one of BC's best known communicators, political commentators and strategists. Bill writes a politics column Tuesdays in 24 Hours newspaper and The Tyee online magazine. Bill has been Communications Director in the B.C. Premier's Office and at the BC Federation of Labour. Bill owns West Star Communications, a consulting firm providing strategy and communication services for labour, business, non-profits and government.""""

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",1

There have been numerous reports of Justin Bieber spending time in church in the past few months, but what we didn't realize was it wasn't any old church he was visiting — it was the church of past relationships.

Bieber's fans are currently convinced the 23-year-old pop-star has been abiding by a ""Love Bible"" he wrote while rekindling his romance with ex, Selena Gomez, and reports even claim the ""Sorry"" singer has “10 Commandments” for their “revived relationship.”

The relationship “just might last” this time around because he “made himself a list of 10 commandments"" for wooing his on-and-off girlfriend, an “insider” is quoted as saying, adding that Bieber has been following the commandments “religiously.""

He's also reportedly sworn off partying and is meditating daily to stay focused.

“Some of the commandments are all about romance,"" the insider says, explaining that others are just about being ""open and trustworthy"" and a few are about being more present for Gomez.

While no full list has been revealed, the source claimed ""Thou shalt cook food for your girlfriend” is one of them, which anyone can get on board with.

Besides, Bieber was spotted giving his Pastor an 18 second hug last week, and that's all the evidence I need to know he's changing his ways and is ready to accept Christ back into his life.

This boy has always loved a good bible.

For now the rest of us will just have to stick to the 10 commandments of being a Belieber, because thou shalt NEVER say NEVER.

The rumour mill went into overdrive when reports started circulating that Brad Pitt had been spotted at an LA party with Princess of Monaco Charlotte Casiraghi – an Angelina Jolie lookalike – but apparently, sources close to the star have slammed the claims.


Pitt was reportedly spotted at a Los Angeles County Museum of Art event with the Princess – who is the granddaughter of Grace Kelly – but according to The Sun, they are not attached romantically.

Both stories come from unnamed sources, so it’s impossible to know who’s telling the truth. Like Pitt, 53, Casiraghi, who is 31, has endured a high-profile separation and has children from a previous relationship.

They are said to have been introduced by Pitt’s Allied co-star Marion Cotillard, who is a close friend of Casiraghi’s.

Pitt and Jolie announced they had filed for divorce in September 2016, as stories of Pitt’s alcohol and drug abuse started circulating. They have six children together.

He even took to the stage to introduce Sting and his good friend Chris Cornell of the rock band Soundgarden. The actor was seen during the whole event high spirited. He also posed with Cornell and Zach Galifianakis (Hangover Star).

Pitt mingled with former wife Jennifer Aniston's fellow cast Courteney Cox in the famous TV show Friends who also made the scene. In his black dress and same old hair style Pitt looks returning to his shape again.

It can be recalled that Pitt 53, and former wife Jolie 41 filed a divorce in September, then on December Pitt claimed Jolie was publicizing the custody case to manipulate the situation now they came to an agreement of handling children's custody more privately.  In a joint statement released on Tuesday, they vowed to keep court documents private, and a united front was affirmed while custody battle over their six children is still ongoing - Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8. The joint statement reads, ""The parents are committed to act as a united front to effectuate recovery and reunification,"" ET reported.

The claim of Jolie that Pitt had verbally or otherwise abused their children was all cleared as investigated by the FBI and the LADCFS.

Pitt may have been recovered from such hard times during their court battle with Jolie and the longing for living separately with his children. He was also seen at the recent Golden Globe awards.

Is Brad Pitt back to blondes? Shortly after his split with Angelina Jolie, rumors swirled about Pitt’s on-set chemistry with Allied actress Marion Cotillard. Linked to many of his co-stars throughout his long career, including his soon-to-be ex, it’s no wonder Jolie wasn’t keen to have him work with blonde bombshell, Margot Robbie. A source exclusive to OK! reports, “He thinks she’s the hottest girl in Hollywood right now.” According to the source, the 41 year old actor and President of Plan B Films has “tried to woo her for numerous movie projects. This was a sore subject with Angie who blocked them from working together a few times. Now he’s single again you can expect Brad to go after Margot with a passion.” And who could blame him? The 26 year old Australian beauty has been dubbed “the new Angelina Jolie,” stirring fear in the hearts of celebrity wives. She has her own reputation for on-set chemistry with married actors including Will Smith. With hot and heavy sex scenes and photos surfacing of them looking cozy off camera, Smith himself had to address the rumors on twitter, “It’s disappointing that goofing around on set could be taken so out of context.”

Pitt, whose split from Jolie was announced in September, appeared in good spirits while promoting his new movie, Allied. Could he be ready to move on with a new leading lady? The Wolf of Wall Street star is “totally his type and he has zero plans to stay single.” Pitt, who was engaged to Seven co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and married to light-haired beauty Jennifer Aniston may not be able to fight it. Robbie met her current boyfriend, film director Tom Ackerley while filming the movie Suite Francaise. The couple has been together now for three years but, according to the source “the fact she’s dating someone else won’t bother him at all.”

 criticism of jesus/plucking eyeballs out/slavery 

Jesus has been criticized as vindictive, intolerant, prudish, and unkind. Several scholars have noted that he appears to condone slavery.

The cardinal Avery Robert Dulles stated that Jesus “said not a word against slavery as a social institution"""", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.  In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, """"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery,” and argues that Jesus must have then condoned it.

Friedrich Nietsche argued that “a war was declared on passion” in the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says of sexual temptation: """"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out."""" According to Nietsche, “Destroying the passions and cravings, merely as a preventive measure against their stupidity and the unpleasant consequences of this stupidity, today this itself strikes us as merely another acute form of stupidity. We no longer admire dentists who """"pluck out"""" teeth so that they will not hurt any more…. the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.”[Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83] """,1

2649,"Ellen DeGeneres Dines With Mystery Brunette Amid Divorce Rumors With Portia de Rossi

Ellen DeGeneres stepped out with a mystery brunette recently amid rumors of her impending divorce with wife Portia de Rossi. Photos of the TV host all smiles with the unknown woman only fuelled speculations of their separation.

According to reports, DeGeneres stepped out with the mystery brunette on June 1. She enjoyed a vegan meal with the mystery woman at Crossroads in West Hollywood. The host seemed to be in a jolly mood as she and her date left the restaurant.

Photos emerged of the pair leaving the restaurant and walking the street. DeGeneres did not seem perturbed by the attention and at one point even waved at the camera. She also continued to smile for the paparazzi. Meanwhile, the mystery brunette appeared bothered by all the attention and continued to keep her head down. DeGeneres' wife de Rossi was nowhere to be found.

DeGeneres' date supposedly came after she and de Rossi were spotted bickering at each other at a restaurant. The host's cheerful demeanor with her mystery date supposedly also differs from the previous weeks, when she appeared tense with de Rossi.

Photos of DeGeneres with the mystery brunette only seem to fuel rumors about her divorce with de Rossi. However, the host has since denied these claims. She told People in a previous interview that her marriage with de Rossi remains intact. ""I can't imagine not being married. I have my best friend, the person I want to spend time with more than anybody else in the world,"" DeGeneres said.

Likewise, she shut down rumors about her divorce with de Rossi in an interview with Howard Stern on Sirius XM. ""We really don't almost break up, we don't fight, we're madly in love, and I guess it's boring,"" DeGeneres said as quoted by Entertainment Tonight.

DeGeneres also admitted that she does not read the tabloid. She does not pay attention to the divorce rumors surrounding her marriage to de Rossi. This probably explains why she appears cheerful and at ease during her date with the mystery brunette.

ELLEN DEGENERES fears she's got a creepy house-guest in her new $40 million mansion – a ghost!

The talk-show host, 56, has repeatedly been spooked by eerie noises and believes the home she shares with wife Portia de Rossi is haunted by its original owner, who died there in 2009, a source says.

""The house had been remodeled, so Ellen thought it would have no trace of the former owner,"" said a pal. ""But she was wrong. Within a few nights of moving in, Ellen started hearing random noises, including foot­steps and doors opening and closing.

""Then, in the middle of the night, she heard a woman's faint cry.

She hasn't had a solid night's sleep since she moved in.""

She said she's never been a believer in ghosts or spirits, the source continued, ""but she doesn't have any other explanation for the mysterious sounds and voices.""

The boo-tiful mansion, a 13,000-square-foot architectural masterpiece, was built for real es­tate developer Sidney Brody and his wife Frances in 1951. Known as the Brody House, it's located in the exclusive Holmby Hills neighborhood next door to the famed Playboy Mansion. Brody died in 1983. His wife, a renowned art collector and philanthropist, passed away in the house at age 93 after a long illness.

After her death, an inves­tor purchased the home and completely remodeled it. Real estate maven Ellen then bought the nine-bedroom, eight-bathroom spread in early January.

""It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that Ellen couldn't pass up,"" said the source.

According to the source, Ellen said she's convinced the noises and voices she hears are Frances Brody's, and Ellen thinks Mrs. Brody's spirit can't bear to part with the house, even in the afterlife.

""Friends have convinced Ellen to conduct a spiritual cleansing ceremony in the house,"" the source said. ""She doesn't want her new home to have any bad energy, and she's not going to share it with Frances Brody.""

2888,"George, Amal Clooney donate $1M to Southern Poverty Law Center to combat hate groups

If money talks, George and Amal Clooney made it shout Tuesday, by donating $1 million to the Southern Poverty Law Center to help fight hate groups in the wake of tragedy and violence in Charlottesville, Va.

The SPLC, a leading civil-rights group that monitors hate groups and campaigns against bigotry, is partnering with the Clooney Foundation for Justice to increase its ability to combat hate groups in the USA by highlighting the dangers of white-supremacist ideology.

The SPLC said further details on what the money will be used for will be available later.

""Amal and I wanted to add our voice (and financial assistance) to the ongoing fight for equality,"" Clooney said in a statement to USA TODAY. ""There are no two sides to bigotry and hate.”

The latter comment was an allusion to President Trump's much-criticized assertions last week that neo-Nazis and white supremacists and anti-fascist counter-protesters who confronted them in Charlottesville were equally culpable for the violence that led to three deaths on the weekend of Aug. 11-12. Trump said there are ""fine people"" on ""both sides.""

""We are proud to support the Southern Poverty Law Center in its efforts to prevent violent extremism in the United States,"" the Clooneys said in their prepared statement. ""What happened in Charlottesville, and what is happening in communities across our country, demands our collective engagement to stand up to hate.""

Since Charlottesville, the center also has received major donations from Apple and from JPMorgan Chase, whose leaders — Tim Cook at Apple and Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase — both spoke out on the need for America's leading business and cultural institutions to take stands against bigotry and hate.

George Clooney was a supporter of Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign and is well-known as a leading Hollywood liberal. His wife, Amal Alamuddin, is a Lebanese-born British lawyer known for her human-rights legal work around the world.

The Clooneys founded and serve as presidents of the Clooney Foundation for Justice, established in 2016 ""to advance justice in courtrooms, classrooms and communities"" around the world.

SPLC president Richard Cohen  said hate-group monitors were ""shocked by the size, ugliness and ferocity"" of the white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville.

“It was a reflection of just how much Trump’s incendiary campaign and presidency has energized the radical right,"" Cohen said. ""We are deeply grateful to the Clooney Foundation for standing with us at this critical moment in our country’s fight against hate.”

2780,"Oscars: Mel Gibson, Casey Affleck and Hollywood's Sliding Scale of Moral Punishment

The men's restroom of the Landmark Theatres in West L.A. is as good a place as any to gauge the true sentiments of Oscar voters. Following a showing of Hacksaw Ridge a few Saturdays ago, I found myself washing my hands next to two gentlemen — both appeared to be about 63, the average age of Academy members, with one wearing a Kung Fu Panda 2 cap (the kind of hat a grown man doesn't wear unless he worked on the movie) discussing what they had just seen. ""Didn't want to like that one but ... ,"" the first man said, trailing off. ""But Mel can direct,"" the friend finished.

I knew instantly why they were conflicted. This season, admiration for Hacksaw Ridge as an emotional and deftly staged World War II action drama has come despite the fact that its filmmaker has made anti-Semitic and misogynistic comments. Hacksaw is one of several films in the awards race featuring marquee talent with personal issues in their pasts, highlighting the age-old concern of whether voters should judge the man (and yes, they're all men in this situation), his work or a combination of both?

Like my two restroom pals, awards voters so far this season have been embracing Gibson. Hacksaw Ridge has landed on the AFI top 10 list and earned seven Critics' Choice and three Golden Globe noms, including best picture (drama) and best director for Gibson. It's a pretty remarkable turn for a filmmaker who, just six years ago, was fired by his own agents.

At the same time, awards bodies (aside from the NAACP, which nominated it for six Image Awards) and critics groups have ignored The Birth of a Nation, a film that just 11 months ago was lauded by many tastemakers as a sure-fire best picture nominee and the antidote to #OscarsSoWhite. But that was before the details of filmmaker-star Nate Parker's college rape trial resurfaced this summer, along with the news that his accuser had committed suicide. So low have Birth's awards prospects sunk that the film didn't even appear on lists of Globe or SAG Award snubs. And Fox Searchlight, which typically hosts a ""holiday party"" to allow its talent to mingle with voters, turned this season's soiree into a celebration of Jackie, its other contender, ignoring Birth.

Why do some personal troubles stick to movies while others seem to not bother voters? That question has arisen throughout Oscar history. Russell Crowe's assault of a BAFTA producer is said to have cost him an Oscar for 2001's A Beautiful Mind, but in 2003, Roman Polanski won best director for The Pianist even though he couldn't accept his award in person because he is a fugitive from justice after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor, then 13, in 1977.

This year, these issues haven't only swirled around Gibson, Parker and, to a lesser extent, Woody Allen, whose latest film, Cafe Society, arrived at Cannes amid renewed allegations by his son Ronan Farrow that Allen had sexually abused Ronan's sister Dylan. Some have questioned why Casey Affleck, a best actor frontrunner for his powerful performance in Manchester by the Sea, has not been subject to Nate Parker-style scrutiny for the two sexual harassment lawsuits filed against him in 2010 by a female producer and a director of photography who claimed Affleck tormented them during the making of the bizarre mockumentary I'm Still Here. DP Magdalena Gorka's suit claimed she was made to suffer ""a nearly daily barrage of sexual comments, innuendo and unwelcome advances by crewmembers, within the presence and with the active encouragement of Affleck."" Affleck denied the allegations and settled the suits for a reported $2 million. So far, he's picked up a Gotham Award and a Critics' Choice win.

Some have insinuated that Parker's race played a role in his banishment, either consciously or subconsciously. And they may be right. Another factor might be the especially shocking nature of the claims against him, despite his acquittal, or his refusal in media interviews to apologize, or the fact that sexual assault is dramatized in his film. But it might also be the clubby nature of Hollywood that forgives those perceived as insiders and gives no benefit of the doubt to those who aren't. Affleck, a Hollywood presence for almost as long as his brother Ben, is an insider. Gibson, movie star and best picture winner for Braveheart, is another insider. He was sent to directors jail for a decade before reemerging this year, and voters seem to be saying enough time has passed. Also, his movie is really good.

This time of year, it's all about getting voters to actually see the contenders. And while one Oscar-nominated producer recently told me he felt an ""ickiness"" when deciding to pop in his Hacksaw screener, he did it anyway and liked the film. This same producer didn't think twice about watching Manchester. But, like many, he hasn't even bothered to open his Birth of a Nation screener.

On Wednesday, the “Hairspray Live” star shared the news with her followers on Twitter, writing, “Let’s do this #TeamJHud!!” Hudson will sit alongside Miley Cyrus, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton.

“In tears thinking of what this means and represents to me and knowing and walking the journey!” she wrote.

Of course, Hudson knows her way around a singing competition show, so we think it’s safe to say she’ll be a great fit. Not only was she a winning coach on the U.K. version of “The Voice,” she also got her start appearing as a contestant on the third season of “American Idol.” (Despite coming in seventh place, she’s hands down one of the most famous “Idol” alums.)

“Jennifer is an extraordinary vocal talent and one of the premier voices of our time. She embodies the experience, expertise, positivity and sheer talent that ‘The Voice’ stands for,” Paul Telegdy, NBC’s president of NBC’s alternative and reality group, said in a statement obtained by Variety. “Her exceptional skills as a singer and actress have extended to film, television and Broadway, which makes her an incredible addition and a natural fit for our show.”

Later on Thursday, it was announced that “American Idol” OG Kelly Clarkson would also be joining the NBC show, where she’ll coach with Levine and Shelton in Season 14, according to Variety. The outlet noted a fourth coach for that season has not yet been confirmed.

“I’m so excited to join ‘The Voice’ at NBC,” Clarkson said in a statement. “We’ve been going back and forth with them for years on joining their team and the timing hasn’t been right until now. Ever since NBC and I worked together on my Christmas special years ago we have established an amazing relationship and I have always loved coming on to either mentor, or perform on ‘The Voice’ over the years. I can’t wait to turn my chair and see the faces of up and coming artists that I may be able to help get that push and support they’ve been needing to break into this industry. Watch out Shelton… I’m comin’ to win!”

The fact that Hudson and Clarkson are headed to “The Voice” seems like a loss for the team in charge of the “American Idol” reboot, especially since the two singers are among the competition show’s biggest success stories. Variety reports Clarkson was asked to judge on “Idol,” but it doesn’t look like that’s happening now.

Pyrros Dimas (,  born in October 13, 1971) is a retired professional weightlifter. He is considered as one of the greatest weightlifters of all times having been three times Olympic champion and three times World Champion. Dimas was born in Albania  and competed first for the Albanian team, however he is of Greek ethnicity and received his major sports results under the Greek flag after he emigrated to Greece in 1992.

OK, I'll try to sort through your latest post here. Let me know if I misinterpret something.
First, you specify a theory (axiomatic system), namely ZFC-P+""""P(P(omega)) exists"""". Let's call that T0 for easy reference.
Now you argue that T0 proves the existence of a model (let's call it M1  the 1 because it's not a model of T0, but of a new theory), such that:
M1 satisfies ZFC-P
P(omega) is in M1. Now, do you mean the real P(omega), or do you mean that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists""""  that is, that there's an element of M1 that M1 thinks is P(omega)?  I'm guessing the latter  that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists"""".
You say """"aleph2 is in the model and is less than or equal to [the cardinality of] P(omega)"""". Again I'm guessing you mean that this is in the model's opinion; that is, M1 satisfies the statement """" exists and |"""".
OK, so going with my guesses thus far, I agree that T0 proves the existence of such an M1. M1 might be, for example, M0[G], where M0 equals  (which is a model for T0), and G is M0-generic for the partial order to add  Cohen reals.

 Very serious stuff 

Sherlock Holms, and his sidekick Watson, are out camping on a dark clear
moonless night.

In the middle of the night, Watson is suddenly, and perhaps even indignantly
awakened, by the famed detective, who says to him, """"Watson, look up at the
night sky, and tell me what you deduce?"""" To which Watson, rubbing his eyes
for a moment, responds, saying, """"Well, let me see now. There are stars,
countless stars in the sky, and I can even see the Milky Way galaxy. And so,
if those stars that I can see clearly with the naked eye are themselves only
a small fraction of the total number of stars, then by logical deduction
there may be and likely are countless more that I cannot see. Now, if only a

 I was thinking about this last night, and came to two conclusions: First, focusing solely on this article is not the way to go.

[Don't tell me GW is FA and is therefore academically rigorous; the FA star does not even come within discus-throwing distance of establishing an article as """"academically rigorous.""""]. Second, your system of defending this Wikipedia page (notice I didn't say """"article"""") is completely airtight, because you hold control over all of the definitions. Join any high school debate team and they'll tell you, if you own the definitions, you own the debate. And the problem here is this: you define anyone who disagrees with AGW as a """"denialist""""; and you define everyone who agrees with you as an """"expert."""" Done! The page is impregnable. Take forex the quote by Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Using her comments as supporting evidence of the page's (not """"article's) thesis is a flagrant act of POV that proves this page (not """"article"""") is an op-ed piece from start to end. Barbara Boxer is a politician. Every bit of power, money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only: to characterize herself as a noble public servant, and stereotype her opponents as villains, buffoons or both. Even more — and this is important — Barabara Boxer is not a run-of-the-mill politician. It would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. In short, the Boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the """"so what?"""" test. I intend to delete that one sometime soon too.

It was recently claimed that Sean Penn he is selling his Malibu home in order to begin again with his longtime love and rumoured fiance, Charlize Theron.

And the 54-year-old looked as smitten as ever on Sunday, as the pair, along with Charlize's three-year-old son Jackson, landed at JFK airport in New York City.

The two were seen affectionately holding hands as they made their way through the arrivals lounge, staying close even while waiting for their rides to come.

The Mad Max: Fury Road star showed off a radiant glow, wearing minimal make-up as her blonde locks were swept back and eyes were concealed with black sunglasses.

Sean was a bit more edgy, wearing a grey shirt, black bomber jacket, dark denim trousers, and brown shoes.

Jackson stood out in a patterned blue jacket, printed T-shirt, green trousers and pink shoes.

The threesome's outing comes following reports that Sean has put his Malibu home, which he purchased after his divorce from Robin Wright, on the market in order to begin a new journey with Charlize.

'I'm in love with a woman and home is where the heart is, right?' he said in a candid interview with Esquire.

Married twice before to Madonna and Robin, the Gangster Squad star said that he never expected to be in love at his age.

After dating the Monster star for almost a year, the actor is reportedly going to adopt her son Jackson and relocate to another property in the same area.

'I'm in love with my children,' he said, 'Jackson's very committed here with schools and all that.

'Charlize has friends and family here. And there are upsides and conveniences that come with being here.'

Meanwhile, Charlize has recently been promoting her latest action thriller, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Sean can currently be seen in The Gunman.

2710,"Why Can't Jessie J Be Bi?

Singer Jessie J, 24, is in the news because of her sexuality again. But this time, it's not because of something the out and outspoken bi artist has done. Just the opposite. This time, it's because of something an unofficial biographer says she hasn't done. And that thing is: have sex with men.

Chloe Govan says that Jessie J is not bisexual -- even though she herself identifies that way -- but is in fact a lesbian. The ""proof,"" according to the biographer, is the ""fact"" that she hasn't dated men since she was 17. That's seven whole years of being only with women. But I'm confused. Does bisexuality come with an expiration date?

Here are some facts that Govan may not be aware of:

According to research from the Williams Institute, the leading LGBT demographic research organization in the world, there are twice as many women who identify as bisexual as there are women who identify as lesbian. That means, among women date women, the odds are two to one that a woman is out as bi.

According to lesbian professor Dr. Lisa Diamond, one of the leading scholars on women's sexuality, lesbian and bisexual women more often have fluid, complex, varied sexual histories than linear, static ones. Bisexual women -- and lesbians -- may be ""50/50"" (in terms of experiences with men and women), they may have long periods of time being with just one gender, and they may even be life-long monogamists who are only ever with one person of one gender. All of that can fall under the umbrella of women who use the word ""bisexual"" to describe themselves.

And according to lesbian professor Dr. Paula Rust, the vast majority of lesbians have had sex with men, both before and after coming out as lesbians.

In fact, in the lesbian community, it's so widely known that most lesbians sleep with men that there's even a term for the very few who don't: gold-star. A gold-star lesbian is a lesbian who has never been with a man.

So, if lesbians can -- and do -- sleep with men, and still call themselves lesbians, then why can't a bisexual woman not sleep with men, and still call herself bi?

If women who identify as bisexual can have enormous variety in their sexual histories, why can't Jessie J be bi?

And if there are twice as many bi women as lesbians, why can't Jessie J be bi?

Research from the Williams Institute also shows that bisexuals tend to be younger than lesbians. Jessie J is 24 years old. Why can't she be bi?

Govan says that Jessie J was forced to say she's bi by music executives, even though she's really a lesbian, because bisexuality would be more appealing to her audience. But according to Dr. Gregory Herek, the leading researcher on stigma, bisexual women are much more stigmatized than lesbians.

Research also shows that bisexual women are more likely than lesbians -- and straight women -- to be victims of domestic violence. This means that bisexual women are considered less appealing and are more attacked. (All of which is extremely disturbing, and has been the subject of much of my other writing.) My point is: this ""bisexuality will draw a bigger audience"" trope is bullshit.

One of Jessie J's most famous songs is called ""Do It Like a Dude."" Around the internet, this song is getting bandied about as further ""proof"" that she's a lesbian. But first of all, why can't bisexual women be masculine, too? And why must lesbians always be? Some of the most masculine women I know are bi, and some of the most feminine ones I know are lesbians.

Second of all, when you read the lyrics, you see that it's actually a song about a butch woman at a bar who turns on men by being her masculine self. The lyrics say, ""Boom, boom, pour me a beer/ No pretty drinks, I'm a guy out here"" and later, ""Boys, come say what you wanna... Boys, gettin' hot under the collar."" Why can't that bi? In fact, how is it not bi?

And finally, why can't Jessie J be bi just because she says she is? Why is it that when a celebrity comes out as a lesbian, I don't read that she's actually really secretly bi, but was pressured by her handlers to say she's gay, but when someone comes out as bi, I see this kind of thing over and over again? Why is female bisexuality so unbelievable to people, and why must a woman's statement about her own (bi)sexuality be discredited? How hard is it to just take a woman's word for it, when she talks about her (bi)sexuality?

Why can't Jessie J be bi?
