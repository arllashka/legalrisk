The teenage posters here are typically the smartest ones.  Let's see... G-Dawg, Head_Banging_Brunette, ClassicAge, Metropolis (even though he's a bipolar weirdo), ChrisScript, just to name a few.

Whereas, most of the teenagers here are thoughtful, intelligent, mature, and often profound.  But they're subject to constant schoolyard bullying by the idiot adult posters who think they're somehow superior because they were born (and dropped on their head) earlier.

"Request to Unblock
I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.

WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents

User: AuburnPilot

A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

P.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency. Sorry, but I don’t have any sympathy for the Devil.",1

Penis envy
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.

Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.

In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

[edit] Freud's Theory

Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article """"On the Sexual Theories of Children,"""" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).

The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).

In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

For girls:

    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.
    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.
    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)
    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",1

Reply from ColonelHenry
I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?
 First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical """"rule nazi"""" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly """"this user is an asshole"""" and explain why and state """"this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"""" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say """"asshole"""" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a """"dick"""" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.
 In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to """"wait until after TFA"""" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize """"hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.
 And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's """"Will to Power"""" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.

As for why, I like """"nineteenth"""" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for """"brevity's sake"""" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to """"kick rocks.""""

As far as I'm concerned, this is over. Move on. I am not addressing this any further, because nonsense like this keeps me from contributing and convinces me to leave Wikipedia again, and this time for good.

The Urantia Readers-Intl has hundreds of readers worldwide in places such as Denmark, Saudi Arabia, Europe, Korea, etc. Your self repressed reality is necessary for you to get through each day of your bitter resentful life.

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1

The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. 

Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing.

 Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please.

Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes.
Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe.

Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action).

Again,I see that this is already discussed.Feral is not reliable,its a tabloid.Only reliable newspapers should be used.And these quotations in Feral,while they may be true,there are no links to check the meaning,because they may be taken out of contest,and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contest.This is not reliable.

"Ooooh, here's our Swiss neutralist! And what does this administrator bring to the table this time? Let's see, accusations of parroting, arbitrary classification of users based upon pen-name preferences, straw-men, ignoratio elenchi, and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously. We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.

Like I stated before, it doesn't matter if I'm a Nazi, Communist, Liberal or even a hippie. It doesn't matter if I do drugs, or if I look even remotely like a reptile. It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

"Yes, there should be criticism of Schengen.  For Americans and Canadians who want to come and teach English in Schengen countries, the Schengen Agreement is a disaster.  Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!! They seem to be trying to copy George BUsh with the creation of Schengen. Fuck you EU government dickheads, we ESL teachers all hate you!!!!!!!  You ruined our jobs, our profession.

Like I said I have been informed this comic in nothing more than 2 or 3 sheets of zerox paper stapled together. Not in the usual format as a printed affair. He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk)

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

You punish Wikid for making a joke about a swine that offended The Magnificent Clean-Keeper. Yet, you punish me when I complain about horrible words being directed at me, including the repeated use of the """"F"""" word by The Magnificent Clean-Keeper towards me. There has been a great deal of harassment directed towards me, yet you totally ignore it or never looked into it. Then you make the totally false charge that I  misused mediation. That is outrageous. The mediator turned out to have a srong bias. He could not fulfill the role of an impartial mediator, in my opinion. To say that rejecting a mediator who had openly expressed a strong bias is wrongful is just more bias on your part. I agree that Wikipedia is not an advocacy site, and that is the exact point I have tried to make. BOTH sides of the murder mystery need to be included but since you have blocked both editors on the same side and encouraged the others to remove ALL of our work, it will hardly be a surprise when this article reads like the prosecutor's brief.

 Hahaha 

Check this out:

MickMacNee, an editor with a long history of block for disruptive behaviour [10], seems to have gone out of line in the last days. I don't mind him being defensive of an article he has written the major part about, and several users in the AfD discussion have been very much engaged in it, including myself. However, I object to the repated personal attacks and uncivil behaviour by the editor. His history is rather long, so I provide just a few selected diffs of uncivil comment and direct personal attacks during the last days 11, [12], [13], [14]. In the discussion on this page about a third user, he calls my arguments for not agreeing with him """"""""evasion, obfuscation, interuption and intentional deafness"""". That is rather typical of his attitude in the AfD discussion where he agressively drives that everybody disagreeing with him are wrong. I've tried to point it out to him, [15] but with hindsight (given our infected history) it might have been better not to as I should have predicted how he would respond.[16] However, I'm far from alone in having that opinion. In the last days, several other editors have also commented on his behaviour [17], [18], [19], [20].Jeppiz (talk) 

That block log looks like something out of a Wiki-horror story...why has he not been given long blocks in the past? I would go for a longer-term block. Ks0stm (T•C•G)  
A users block log is not (generally) an excuse to throw the book at him, this looks a bit silly if you ask me, a bit of a tit for tat heated discussion over a article for deletion discussion that is split down the middle, and nothing will come of it, I can't find a really uncivil comment, perhaps if you guys just edit different articles for a few days. Off2riorob (talk)  
It goes without saying that everybody has different opinions, but I do think that """"one of the nastiest and most repugnant editors"""", """"Either your comment was simply ignorant of the facts (like you characterisation of my POV), or you are simply trolling, either way, you are all out of credit here tbh"""", """"I've got no idea what crappy papers you read"""", """"It's up to you if you want to parrot everybody's delete opinion as if it makes you look like you know what you are on about, but it really doesn't."""" are not particularly civil. Neither is """"I have had it with your crap."""". In any case, I won't interact with the user again, I rather leave Wikipedia. As I pointed out, I'm far from alone in having made these observations.Jeppiz (talk)  
Off2riorob, I tried your suggestion, in fact I didn't think I'd need to try, I didn't think I'd cross paths with Mick after this bout of abuse. But sure enough I did, and when I reported him for violation of a 1R measure in place on the Northern Ireland article, half of his defence was an assumption of bad faith against me. I guess if someone keeps an eye on him, he can't get too far out of hand. Alastairward (talk)  
It is a bit of a rant, he is clearly very upset about the footie, and I am sorry you have been upset Jeppiz, he has gone now, probably off to bed, I'm sure one of the admins will have a strong word in his ear when he shows his face again. I myself have had a run in with him but he has grown on me, what can I say. Off2riorob (talk)  
Seeing the diffs Alastairward provided, I cannot agree, even though I see that you stood up for him that time as well. This is a user who seems unable to deal with conflicting views and routinely resorts to personal abuse.Jeppiz (talk)  
Nothing routine about it. Your behaviour and Alistair's are pretty similar, which is why they provoked similar responses eventually. If either of you wish me to lay out the full package of evidence for either of your extraordinarily sustained campaigns of tendentious behaviours, I am only too willing to oblige. MickMacNee (talk)  
First of all, Alistair and I are not the only editors you've attacked and insulted, there are at least Grsz [21] and Kevin McE [22] just in the last few days. 
While I have definitely argued with you, I have not called you one of """"the most repugnant editors"""" [23], called your contributions """"crap"""",[24] called you a """"lying hypocritical cunt"""" [25] or told you to """"fuck off"""" [26], [27]. 
Every time someone brings your behaviour to the attention of administrators, you come up with these vague and unsupported accusations that ones you've argued with have behaved in the same way. It is not a defense (then both should be blocked), and it's not true either, just a dishonest way for you to try to talk you out of it.

'You people are unbelievable in your ignorance and the ease to which you get brainwashed by subversive propaganda.
 Learn to read. I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would  be protected. Have you read Paine and Jefferson? You are attacking the wrong men. If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and others.
 I never said they were anarchists. I do say, though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism. If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him. (Something that many of them wanted to do anyway.)
 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now. I personally would love to overthrow the fascist-socialist state we're in right now and get back our freedom. But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom.
 Blah and Bockade, since you think you know the ideologies that are best for me, let me find one for you. Hmm, maybe subverting your current government into a dictatorshiptotalitarian state would be appropriate. Or perhaps, as you are incapable of reading comprehension or the most rudimentary thought, working in a convenience store, rather than editing what used to be an encyclopedia would be a good idea for you.

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life.

 Spanish heraldry 

As a respected contributor to the above article, you're probably best placed to deal with the issues with it. If you want to take it on, I believe there is a lack of: inline citations in particular; good English; and specificity - parts of the article explain heraldry in general, and are not sufficiently (IMHO) to be included in the article (eg. most of the Definitions section). Thanks, -  (t, c) 

 BCN-SIA discussion 

First, sorry because my poor english.

Hi, i don't want to start a undo-war or something like that, but the avionews post is only a rumour. It's a propaganda speech from a Milan SEA not a declaration of any SIA officer.

I've talked with the SIA spanish comercial manager and he says me that the italian SIA officers inmediatly deny that issue, nor the SIA-BCN cancellation, nor the FCO-MXP flights traspassing... and all is a simply propaganda from Milan in this moments of crisis. This was also confirmed by SIA London regional headquarters...

Unfortunately, I haven't found any italy/UK SIA press relase dennying the Milan SEA president affirmations but i think that informations that I have are enough to question the avionews article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Because of that, I have """"twicked"""" the comment from """"until summer 2009"""" to """"probably until summer 2009, in which they could codeshare with other Star Alliance partners""""
In the article, the text refered (Today the SiA flights carry out the Singapore-Malpensa-Barcelona route but in short time the flight will be reduced to Singapore-Malpensa route, while the continuation to Barcelona will be assured by Lufthansa Italia), is not referenced as Bonomi's words but as an explanation by Avionews.
The comments is not anymore an affirmation but a puntuation between brackets. Sincerely, I fail to see your urge to remove it. Cheers. MauritiusXXVII (Aut Disce, Aut Doce, Aut Discede!). 

I don't have a urge to remove it. I don't remove it. I only explain it to you the situation.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 85.58.34.97

"After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

Your donation will fund Wikia, Inc., which is not a charity. Your non-profit donation will ultimately line the for-profit pockets of Jimmy Wales, Amazon, Google, the Bessemer Partners, and other corporate beneficiaries. How? Wikipedia is a commercial traffic engine. As of December 2008, there are over 14,700 external links from Wikipedia to Wales' Wikia.com sites, which are funded by Google AdSense revenues. Did you know that Amazon invested $10,000,000 in the for-profit Wikia venture? It's therefore rather interesting that there are over 43,000 links to Amazon's retail site from the supposedly non-profit Wikipedia site. Isn't it? Meanwhile, did you know that the popular movie site IMDB.com is owned by Amazon, and you can buy Amazon products directly from IMDB pages? Well, surprise surprise  there are nearly 174,000 links to Amazon's IMDB site from Wikipedia. No wonder Amazon particularly wished to invest in Wikia, Inc. Its co-founder makes sure that the external linking environment on Wikipedia is hospitable for the Amazon link spamming machine! 

Now here is the really fascinating thing. If you go to Jimmy Wales' """"talk page"""" on Wikipedia, and you ask him whether he feels that this obscene number of links to his for-profit site and those of his investors might be a conflict of interest or self-dealing, Jimbo won't even have time to respond. One or two of his sycophants will fairly promptly dismiss or erase your message; and if you try one more time to ask this question, you're likely to get blocked from editing Wikipedia altogether.

"Hey, you idiot,
It is not a crime to post the truth about people, especially their personal information. And if their personal information ruins their lives, then they deserve it.

"I have no idea why you are posting the slang definitions of 'fuck'.  That is a total non-sequitur.  I have not seen anyone here assert that there aren't any ways of using 'fuck' that are slang.  The point was, and remains, that the standard use of the word 'fuck' as both a noun and a verb - the only ways that this word has been used in this entire discussion throughout this entire week up until your latest post - has been the standard definition that is widely understood and accepted as a normal word that is nowhere near slang.

You used this non-sequitur as your basis for reversion.  And to this day you are persisting in it.  Yet again another example of a huge logic disconnect that permeates this entire exchange.

As for the meta-discussion (the discussion about the discussion), Andy's revert was based upon his assessment that the issue needed to be discussed before such a change could be accepted.  And where did he choose to raise that discussion?  Over on my User Talk page.  That is the most inappropriate place to have such a discussion.  I suggested to him that the discussion be moved here.  Instead he moved it to an Admin page where he called for me to be blocked.  Is that the action of anyone who wants rational discussion?  (This too are questions that I do not need anyone's answer to.)

As for your opinion that this issue is now resolved, I never shared any such view.  I added the 'See also' link as a step in the right direction.  Not as a cure.  I can't have stated that more clearly that I STILL see the article as broken.

 A hit list for Jews 
There is a site called Jew Watch out there (I'll let you find the link) which specialises in """"keeping an eye on Jewish activities"""".  It is used as a reference site by anti-semites the world around.  Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not, under any circumstances, list someone who they cannot confirm 100% is Jewish.  Stormfront, a white supremist web forum, uses Jew Watch all of the time.

The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch.  It is a criteria designed for anti-semites.  It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews.

Jewish communities do not have such a criteria.  They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community, through race, religion or culture.  This is the normal criteria that is used.  If your father is Jewish, then per Jewish community standards, you are Jewish.  And so forth.

Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability.  But these criteria are not being applied to this list.  This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list.  Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the """"real Jews"""".  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.

Right now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.  Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages, it is dangerous to continue to have such a page.  It is encouraging hatred of Jews.""",1

""":It is neither more historically correct, nor more professional. Scholars routinely use the term """"Nazi"""". You cite the Encyclopedia Britannia as evidence of your claim. But, in fact, the Encyclopedia Britanica uses Nazi an order of magnitude more often than National Socialism. In the online version of the Encyclopedia, there are 10,200 references to Nazi and only 1020 references to """"National Socialism"""". And in the title of the entry for """"National Socialism"""", they write """"also called Nazism or Naziism"""". 

Your claim that use of the term """"Nazi"""" is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term. The claim that """"National Socialism"""" is a """"more full and correct designation"""" is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous. And while it is true that """"Nazi"""" can be used as an epithet, so can """"dog"""". Do you also recommend that Wikipedia refrain from using the word """"dog"""" to describe dogs? 

It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument. The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term """"Nazi"""" rather than """"National Socialist"""" throughout his book. I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite.

I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics. What part of Nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents?

Just how many sticks of dynamite would need to go off inside your thick head before you get it? Trying to dismiss the WBO is piss weak. It's been on par with the other 3 for years. Check the record of wbo champions in unification fights.

This is the last time I'm explaining it, so read carefully. When Jones-Johnson happened there was ALREADY an undisputed linear champion - Michalczewski. Jones & Johnson's belts meant NOTHING....PAPER titles. As well as being linear champion, Michalczewski & was the RIGHTFUL HOLDER of the WBA/IBF belts anyways. He never lost them in the ring. He was stripped under bogus politics. Your sources are still SHIT. You haven't heard of any of the sources I posted because you're a noob whos only knowledge is from hbo & The Ring, who have ZERO credibility on this issue.

Jones had only won a """"vacant interim"""" wbc belt, champion Tiozzo relinquished the wbc belt, Jones was declared wbc holder then relinquished it. Rocchigiani won it then Jones decides he wants it back so the wbc illegally stripped Rocchigiani. Michalczewski then defeated the rightful holder.

Re-read the fucking link;

My main source is the Linear championship policy which goes back over 100 years. A policy you, being so dumb, don't even understand.

That's not the case. You are one of MANY arrogant, conceited, self-absorbed losers that populate Wikipedia who use this site as some sort of self-esteem builder, because here you can act like a """"big man"""", and make unilateral decisions on what's acceptable or unacceptable here.

If I had the time or the inclination, I could spend several months quoting entries and instances on Wikipedia where editorial verbiage is used. You are simply a pompous ass who thinks you are the gatekeeper of anything poker-related on Wikipedia. You are not, and you will not censor me.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back.

Okay with regards to that last little comment: How about you try choking on my balls you over 
excitable ancient. Forgive my antagonism but I give only as much as I receive, and I have most 
certainly received a substantial quantity from you. You may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator. In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in """"chat-rooms"""" and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment. I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing. You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical """"angry"""" way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22. It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be.

"YOu moron, do not accuse me to go and study. The fools and used like condom people with small or with no brains are YOU! That is also a reason why never Pashtuns can ever establish their fake claims (such as on Ghurids). Because you have no roots to anything. You are not related. Puta Khazana claims are fabricated like the shamefull book self. The bi-sexual Abdul Hai Habibi wanted to copy Shahnama... that´s all behind Pashtun nationalism. New archeological studies led by Dr. Zmarai show the Ghurids beeing non-Pashtuns. Now go and kill Zmarai who spit in the face of Abdul Hai Habibi and clean with Puta Khazana it´s ass.

What has now your valueless and waste comment has to do that Iranians were to the rising of Safavids Sunnis? That´s how a Pashtun think. Your logic is the logic of long ear Afghans, not connected or compatible with the educated world of human-beeings. Your comment on my comment should make 2+2=4 ... but since your comment have no connection to my comment the result will stay 2 (2+0=2). This is long ear Afghan (Pashtun) logic.

"re webquest help links removed
I can't believe how you people run this place. WTF is wrong with you? There were 5 different linked sites that provided help on the Da Vinci Code webquests - 2 were for the original webquest and those links had been here on Wikipedia for several years without issue and were the most well-used resources for the webquests on the internet, and then 3 more links were recently added for help with the NEW Google webquests that just started this month. NOTE that these new Google webquests are not related to the older original webquests at all, and do NOT superced them in any manner. ONE person comes along who has created a new site that provides help ONLY for the NEW Google webquests (and no help whatsoever with the older original webquests), and this prat deletes ALL the links and information to ALL the webquest help sites both old and new, and replaces them with his own link, and when several site owners try to put their information back up, this clown repeatedly deletes it ..and then you mods back him up??? WTF is up with that??? PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR ACTIONS??? Your page now provides absolutely no links to help with the original webquests, and only one link for help with the new webquest, which is all thanks to this one selfish prat from googlefact.blogspot.com. Oh wait, there's one more link too, and that's to his mirror site at davinciquest.blogspot.com. How can you justify your actions? The owner of googlefact.blogspot.com also posted on the site of one of the links he removed (student-rant.blogspot.com), to laugh at everyone and thank us all for the traffic and the ad-impression revenue it is generating for him. AND THIS IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE SEEM TO CONDONE???? If you could give some reason for your actions then perhaps all of us site owners who were deleted could understand, but we do not see that there is any justification for what you have done, nor has anyone offered any. The ONLY message we're getting here is that it pays to manipulate Wikipedia for personal gain and delete everyone else's links but your own. WE HUMBLY REQUEST YOU RECTIFY THIS MATTER AND THEN LOCK THE PAGE TO STOP THE PERSON WHO STARTED ALL THIS FROM DOING IT AGAIN - which happens to be the one link you have left on the page. At a bare minimum, restore the help links to the original webquests so people looking for help with them can actually get some.

"Don't be stupid. You know, I'm twice as irritated with you as you are with Sheryn. If you don't like her SHUT UP and LEAVE. Wikipedia is no place for mongrels like you. I do not care if you live in Chicago, the UK, or some place, but being totally foolish in Wikipedia is uncalled for. We don't need to know that you find Sheryn's voice sounding like Tuesday Vargas'. Unless you find a news article saying so, then go ahead.
I may agree with you regarding incorporating titles here in Wikipedia articles, but just so you know, this is Star Records idea and not her fans'. Don't sound as if you know EVERYTHING about Sheryn. In fact, you don't have any right to edit her article if you don't know her. Just because you see her on TV doesn't mean you know her.

"I'm sorry I was an asshole about it.  The point is that the vowels in man and noun are raised in AusE according to Felicity Cox (2005), and the phonetic transcription for that IDEA example I gave you transcribes man as , and indeed it sounds like that to my ears, although that speaker did seem a bit broad.  It's not that uncommon for vowels to be raised before nasals.  Take for example the pin-pen merger in Southern American English and in southwestern Ireland or the non-phonemic æ-tensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the Northern cities vowel shift.  The only reason I brought this up is because I imagine it is very noticeable to English ears (it's even noticeable to my American ears).  Many English people might pronounce man as , which sounds quite a bit different from .  You're the Aussie here, so I'm sure you can verify this by simply contrasting your man with your bad (in this case both would have a long vowel, so try to listen for the quality of the vowels) or your noun with your loud.  This is just another little thing that distinguishes Aussie English from English English; that's all.",1
First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency. They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world.

So here is the hilarious and somewhat tricky part. I bet Grockl really patted himself on the back for this one.

In this study, there is NO OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE that says pulsatile irrigation is more effective than other irrigation methods EXCEPT in the following reference: """"It has also been shown that pulsatile saline delivery is more effective in removing bacteria than delivery via bulb syringe.""""

I'm not english and I rather be trolling right now than being a 12/13 years old wikipedia non-life geek (you know what I'm talkng about)!
Oh, we know what you're talking about, all right. Trust me.   
His IP is French, so, yeah, I won't hold his English skills against him. His personality, and his intellectual abilities, however, are things that I will hold against him. 
Back on topic, though, it is a common mistake that people make. People fail to understand that finding out the cause of flummery is a field in and of itself. Knowing when you need to enlist the help of an expert, and knowing what the expert is actually able to do, instead of assuming that 'expert ~= god' - that is a skill that many people lack. I suspect that Randi knows more about most scientific fields than many experts know about scientific fields outside their expertise.   

So according to you, it's enough to only """"suspect"""" his scientifc knowledge to make disappear any kind of information related to his educational background ?!

 Unwarranted remarks 
hello.  First of all, I'm very well aware of """"3RR"""", and secondly, you should be aware that I did NOT reach """"3RR"""" or violate anything.  Thirdly, it would be nice (for consistency's sake, but since I see favoritism and politics at work here) that you would give that same lecture to Malik.  Since he was reverting like crazy and getting close to uh """"3RR"""".  Of course you didn't, per your bias in favor of him, for some reason (a problem on Wikipedia that happens with Admins and other users...), and sided with his nonsense that somehow """"ICGC"""" was somehow """"not notable"""".  Never mind that they've been all over tv talk shows for years, guests on interviews, and in the radio, and even in the news.  Never mind that they've been around for decades.  And have internet sites for years.  You'll knee-jerkly take Malik's side on this, because after all, he's """"Malik Shabaz"""".  A bully on Wikipedia who is revert happy, and for some reason you favor.  I do NOT appreciate your remarks to me on his talk page.   I did not violate anything. NOTHING.  But Malik was arguably violating """"I don't like"""" and """"no own"""".  You'll deny that, because after all, he's Malik.  And for whatever reason, whatever he does or says, you (admin or not), seem to knee-jerkly side with.  So now that Malik has obvious back-up for his bullying and ownership violations (back-up from an imperfect Admin who is arguably a bully too doesn't bode well for me, does it) it's hard for me to do anything.  Yes, I'm angry.  Your remarks were obtuse and unnecessary.  I violated nothing.  Malik seems to think he owns a bunch of articles, as is seen from his history and pattern.  Yet you wink at it, or deny that, because, well, he's """"Malik"""".  Good day.   """,1

Blocking me
I dont understand you're motivation for blocking me. You say I made personal attacks and the link I followed was the Qiyamah talk page..I presume you mean my comment that Universaliss was vandalizing it.

I simply want that user to stop 1. reverting to old-outdated versions of the page which contain grammatical and technical inaccuracies, 2. stop the personal attacks, and religious attacks (towards Protestants, Jews, and Ahmadis), 3.and stop deleting information that he/she disagrees with. I really dont think this is asking that much. In terms of diffusing the situation...I tried to add in a passage that all parties could agree to.

"First of all, I've never been blocked before.

Next, let me be clear: Mr. User:Aboutmovies vandalized an article. Then he argued with and ultimately attacked Pcap, the editor who reverted the vandalism. Then Pcap, presumably out of frustration, asked me for help, as I was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article.  I am not active much anymore on wikipedia, so I mostly just I commiserated on Pcap's talk page. I told him I would not get involved. (Why am I not active? Because there are too many assholes like User:Aboutmovies allowed to run free, making life shitty for everyone.)  

Now Mr. User:Aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on Pcap's talk page. And so, after putting his nose where it doesn't belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. Why? This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology. He could have offered an apology. He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. So then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  You were sucked right into his game.  You did not bother to do any due diligence. AT ALL. You should have blocked him, not me.  Once you realized your mistake, which Pcap points out to you above, you could have offered me an apology, turned around, and blocked Aboutmovies instead. Did you bother to do any of these things? No.  You fucked up.

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

These types are incredibly easy to expose for what they are, they do half the job themselves and not one of them has yet """"defeated"""" me or shut me up.

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi.

Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.

Again, I never asserted the Greaseman's death.

Since Neturalhomer chooses to edit his User Talk page to erase the past, I will post the relevant exchange here (he gave """"removing vandalism"""" as the reason for editing it out; his only tool is a hammer, perhaps, so he sees me as a nail, perhaps)

Your Lie(s) About Me

You wrote: """"Final Warning

Saying things like """"DC101 IS HIS FUCKING EMPLOYER!!!"""" and """"Don't be a douche"""" is a good way to get blocked....fast. Tone the language down...and pay attention. Greaseman ain't dead. If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia, I will report you to AIV and to your ISP, Verizon. Stop now, this is your final warning. - NeutralHomer • Talk """"

Yes, I did use the language (on a talk page) and if it will make the booboo feel better, I apologize. But who doesn't enjoy a nice summer's eve?

BUT, you need to STOP LYING about me. I never said the Greaseman was dead, only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated, Eve. Otherwise, perhaps it is I who shall report you. Tell you what: you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed. Fair?

Let's look at your odd writing style: """"If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia,"""" Just what are you going for there?

I've never put a lie on Wikipedia, contrary to your assertion. Anyone who lies about me can go screw.

Your threat to report me to my ISP (FOR WHAT, EVE?) is beyond pathetic. Two pops for yes!! Report away.

Now, the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters.  He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion.

Let's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD.  There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute.  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD.  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did.  THAT IS A LIE.  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines.  Is this a """"separate but equal"""" or """"separate and unequal"""" system?

The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio.  Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we?  There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not?  Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism?

The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part.

To recap: I never lied.  I never vandalized.  That should be enough.

Now let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we?  Sensitive matters, no?

Personal life

Romero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2]

Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime.

Romero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a """"confirmed bachelor."""" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime.

Romero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: """"Butch."""" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: """"You're so butch!"""" While Romero's homosexuality was an """"open secret"""" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years.

Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood",1

"I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not going to pass your articles as GA, because frankly, they suck. But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA.

First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.

There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.

Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.
You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.
The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.

Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",1

I sit at my computer desk
And argue with teenagers on the internet
About atheism
And how Japan is superior to other countries
I learned a bit of Japanese
So now i'm qualified to be a part of their community
So i made my avatar a kawaii waifu

"And now for some... amusement 

After all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """,1

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. 

To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15""",1

 BLACK DAHLIA MURDER IS NOT 'MELODIC DEATH METAL'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE DEATHCORE PUSSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Black Dahlia Murder IS NOT Melodic Death Metal. They are the farthest band from that genre. Black Dahlia Murder are pieces of shit scene bitches that are trying to be """"METAL"""" along with all of the other Deathcore/Grindcore bands like Job For A Cowboy, Suicide Silence, etc. Fuck all of them! They aren't true Metal and they never will be, they need to stick to what they know...American Eagle, MTV, and all of their other lame trends. Melodic Death Metal is Scar Symmetry, In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Disarmonia Mundi. Melodic Death Metal is REAL music, it's not a disgrace to music like Deathcore and Grindcore.

I will continue to change Black Dahlia CUNT'Murder's genre to Deathcore/Grindcore, I don't give a shit..I'm not letting you stupid scene bitches take away the only thing that you and the Mainstream hasn't destroyed and that's the amazing genre of Melodic Death Metal. So fuck all of you trendy conformists, go fucking die.

Black Dahlia Murder are Deathcore pussies that need to be beheaded, them and all of the other Deathcore bands that are ruining Metal.

Deathcore is the biggest piece of shit I've ever heard...it shouldn't even be considered music, it's a bunch of pussy scene kids trying to be """"METAL"""". Deathcore and Grindcore are the two worst forms of music ever invented.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the Guitar while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs.

""""Ya boi....we are so down wit American Eagle..ya boi, my hair does that flippy thing.. RAWR RAWR RAWR I'M SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! GAGES AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR""""

Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit.

Melodic Death Metal owns all. 

There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band.

So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME.""""

Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A Cowboy's vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from Black Dahlia Murder, there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, White Chapel actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and Grindcore bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!!

But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days.

I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on Earth...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm.

Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""".

They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""".

I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""".

Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in.

YA BOI! LETS HARDCORE DANCE! RAHHHH YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Grindcore and Deathcore isn't Metal so all you douchebags should just give up....you aren't Metal and you never will be, go fall into a pool of AID's.

Fear not, pop-eyed little pooch, your point was well taken. You hardly need to remind me that you don't give a """"flying fart""""  about sticking to facts or veracity (although you're very free with low-level sharts here, I've noticed). Happily though, others do. So on second thoughts I'll keep this section—to exhibit, for the appreciation of my other visitors (fully house-trained!), the remarkable specimens produced by my little doggie friend. I shall call them my Little Mexican Doggy Whoppers.

So now you've changed your story of The Hours for the third time, eh? (Or is it fourth? Fifth? I seem to be losing count as you approach the limits of my pitifully deficient arithmetic.) If I, er, comprehend it correctly, the latest draft of The Hours has it that you originally """"thought"""" five hours was """"about"""" two hours. Interesting.  And revealing. In fact you sniffily dismissed the interval as """"less than 2 hours"""" (my emph.). Interesting and revealing because? Because the open-ended """"about"""" tends to support a story of an innocent """"estimate"""".  But """"less than"""" doesn't. """"Less than"""" is specifically limited. Narrowed in focus, specific, it's more clearly a calculated (no pun intended) lie. It's well-known that most liars have trouble remembering which lie they told. Less well-known is the fact that their use of words, trivial though words seem to them, often gives them away. Freudian slips? Elementary, my dear Watson. 

By the way there's a good book by Adventures In The Screen Trade author and screenwriter Bill Goldman called, I think, Which Lie Did I Tell? It's about Hollywood. Are you a Hollywood pooch? Sporting a diamond collar from Harry Winston and peeking out of a B-list celebrity's purse? If so I may be able to sell your crap on eBay, and I insist that you think of this section as your special little pooping place! (Gives a whole new meaning to """"save your crap"""" doesn't it!)

 criticism of jesus/plucking eyeballs out/slavery 

Jesus has been criticized as vindictive, intolerant, prudish, and unkind. Several scholars have noted that he appears to condone slavery.
 
−TABTAB 
−TAB
The cardinal Avery Robert Dulles stated that Jesus “said not a word against slavery as a social institution"""", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.  In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, """"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery,” and argues that Jesus must have then condoned it.  
 
−TABTAB 

How come the Catholic removed this section in his words """"because it didn't appear to be criticism"""" is this a joke?  
−TAB
Friedrich Nietsche argued that “a war was declared on passion” in the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says of sexual temptation: """"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out."""" According to Nietsche, “Destroying the passions and cravings, merely as a preventive measure against their stupidity and the unpleasant consequences of this stupidity, today this itself strikes us as merely another acute form of stupidity. We no longer admire dentists who """"pluck out"""" teeth so that they will not hurt any more…. the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.”[Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83] """,1

Humans have evolved from primates. There are the alpha males, the regular males and the females. Gay males have female minds. At one point in human embryonic development all people were once female. That is why males have nipples. Females have the ability to achieve a muscular orgasm just like a male, however most women do not know how.

Indeed my original unblock request, which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold, stated: 

The following will help the reviewing admin(s) to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors.[...] Killer has a picture of a pop-eyed chihuahua dog on her user page,  captioned “I look like this”; and she is in the habit of referring to herself, in her sysopping summaries, as a dog   e.g. “Puppy has spoken.” Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killer’s expense.'' 

I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfold's request.

My unblock request in no way implies that it is 'somehow OK to insult' you because you refer to yourself as 'puppy'. It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from. It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you.

Louise Henriette de Bourbon-Conti - probably the best example of your obsession with having everything that way you want it; 
Henrietta Anne Stuart - i rearranged the page and added the Template:House of Stuart - clearly a tragedy;
Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre‎ - added titles and styles - where are they; i even tried to compromise by removing the stlyes and putting back the titles but once again you must have your way;
Victoire of France‎ - changed the awful layout along with her sister Princess Louise-Marie of France and Princess Marie Adélaïde of France 

Why?

The latter is quite amusing to me proving that you dont even read the article - you simply revert back because I did it - all I did was move the Template:House of Bourbon (France) to a different part of the page! Then you and your chronic arrogance go and revert it under the claim that there are rv excessive, redundant trivia contained in other articles then as always you groan on an on about the usual rubbish with please don't violate WP:3RR or WP:SOCK WHAT IS YOUR POINT ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Shut up!

Where is this claim about the WP:SOCK even from  - another one of your ridiculous  thoughts. I will not back down.

Wikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",1

I am impressed with how much damage you have done to this account, but it really means nothing when I am still editing every day on my personal internet and you have no idea which account it is. Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned. I know exactly what you are going to do after this to wait until I log off, and then pounce with a new account. Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up. 

Oh wait a second one more thing, , what kind of retarded admin are you when having a bunch of almost all accounts pretending to be me are all on proxies and not ONE of them acts like me (did you even see my history?), and not one uses a real connection? Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny? Yeah.

It seems that this is your style, how many, 3-5 editors keep moving around """"replying"""" to me. Anyway I CANNOT BELIEVE MY EYES READING WHAT NotARealWord just wrote above. 
NotARealWord said, quote """"What do you mean? The statement about their """"100% clean award"""" is cited."""" Are you for real, or you want to insult my/users’ intelligence? What, you have another set of policies about reliable sources and self promotion means? WHO MADE THAT STATEMENT ABOUT 100% CLEAN AWARD? Can you answer me SAREKofVULCAN? My feeling is that the guy from Softpedia entered that...what a reliable source. Secondly, what does it means """"100% clean AWARED""""? Is this “award” given by a reliable, verifiable source/body/entity, maybe Golden Globes? NO, that comes from the same """"reliable source"""", softpedia. And 3r, THIS IS PROOF THAT AMOUNG this team of editors that are against me, are some like (NotARealWord) which is (SAREK here is another personal attack according to your definition) or in a hurry to close my mouth, or just incompetent. 

Here is my proof;  NotARealWord said """"the statement about their """"100% clean award"""" is cited"""".

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of: 1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality). 2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree. 3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs. 4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on. 5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times. 6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:

In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. 

[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, """"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."""" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” 

Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. 

If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? 

Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2",1

All Trayvon had to do is call the cops if he was soooo scared. 

The cops did NOT tell Zimmerman NOT to follow him. There's a HUGE diff btw a 911 operator and a cop. Telling someone 'we don't need you to do that' is NOT the same as a direct order and finally, Zimmmerman claims he DID stop following at that point.

If EIGHT BLACK TEENS were CAUGHT robbing people in that neighborhood, not to mention the ones that didn't get caught, then you'd have to be an IDIOT to not eyeball someone acting as suspiciously as Trayvon. For all we know, he could have robbed someone in the sub in one of his visits. We know the cops said he had a jewel-thieving tool. 

Oh that's right, the cops are not to be trusted. Except when they tell you 'We don't need you to do that.' Then you MUST obey! lol

The only vandal here is you. Let me clefify some things 4 you,

In the 19th century Ilija Garasanin and the rest of the Serb goverment of that time formed a program called """"Nacertanije"""", it was a plan of how to realize the plan of a Great Serbia  on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. This new state would be rulled by Serbs, others would be subjected while Muslims(of any ethnicity) would be distroyed(by genocide sense it´s the only way). They called there Army chetnik, them selfs chetniks and there by this ideology(which is fashist) is chetnik. And any1 who follows it is a chetnik.

The plan failed untill 1918 when the Serbs managed to create a """"Slavic Kingdom"""" which was actually ment to become a Serb Kingdom which was with time shown, during WWII the chetniks allied with the Nazis and commited GENOCIDE. After the death of Tito the chetniks ressurected and tried everyting all over again but ones again failed thank God.

Now, the chetnik PROPAGANDA is used to make Serbs think that it is right to do all that and to foole everybothy else, this propaganda includes showing Bosnia as a """"Serb state"""", Bosniaks as  """"Serbs"""", spreding Islamophobia and Anti-Bosniak settlment or presenting the Serbs as the victoms and so on. THAT site does all that and it is enough to open it and you will see. Now you ain´t nobody so I don´t have to proove anything if you don´t see it then you are either stupid or a chetnik your self.

RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help.

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, ...
having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.
But you should ... stop if there is any objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and

Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

5. Stop using the word cynical to describe your """"enemies."""" You come off even more retarded than your Ilchee bitch master. Your philosophical maturity is less than that of a first grader. The world is """"cynical."""" Those who don't believe in Dahn are """"cynical."""" I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult. 

6. Are you fucking insane? Korea is the center of the universe? Korea as a cultural hub? Korea the place where the next messiah appears? You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.

7. One more time: the philosophical underpinnings of your shit cult are so flimsy I must question your intelligence.

8. Nicola Cola...what kind of bitch ass name is that? what is wrong with you?

I started editing on Wikipedia just to keep my mind occupied, I'm going through deep shit, when I started reading the factual errors and the sick shit like mentioning mortality, dying and suicide on the prognosis section of anorexia nervosa, I started contributing out of altruism.

Also, everything you linked to Dennis Brown, was quite obviously meant as humor. """"ALL I DID WAS TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT COAL WITH SOURCES. Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots. Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN!"""" 

Don't Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called """"Coal Wars"""". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal's Health and Environmental Effects.

Also, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her """"Happiness"""" article under the section """"Philsoophy of Happiness."""" Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche's moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: """"Unsourced"""" as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.

Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR.""""

Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks.

From the main article about Hugo Chavez:

Chávez was raised a Roman Catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission. He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.

I find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health! This just shows what a hypocrite and liar Chavez is!",1

The 'gender gap' will never be closed unless Wikipedia becomes a place for women to gossip and socialize with each other on. The only 'cultural bias' Wikipedia has is that it is 'biased' towards objectively important subjects such as science, which coincidentally happen to be those pursued until recently by the Western society, which incidentally has always been the only culture around at all. The 'undue coverage of women' comes from the fact that there are less notable women. Insisting on 'equal coverage' of women and men will result in unequal proportion of notable and non-notable people. The policies supposed to make the place more accessible to women, such as ill-conceived politeness, will only result in making it less accessible to people who only care about getting the fucking job done. ~~~~",1

Do you think that I'm going to be crazy enough to believe DR is only 11% Black??  I'll be too ashamed of saying such a thing.

Where is the """" denial, anti-black, blaha blah and all the non-sense accusations that you are making by me saying that??

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted.

"I hate Season 4. If there's one thing I hate more than that, it's Paul Tibbit himself!

I hope Paul Tibbit gets fucking cancer and burns in hell!
PAUL TIBBIT IS A WEED-SMOKING BASTARD WHO COMPLETELY FUCKED UP SPONGEBOB!!!!
SpongeBob is a pile of crap now. I don't think I've ever hated a person more than I hate Paul Tibbit. Him and his piss-poor animation skills.
Yeh Tibbit is SUCH A HOMO!!!!
I hope he fucking dies!
What the motherfucking hell is up with people these days? Nick's people obviously smoked lots and LOTS of crack in 2004!
I love Old SPongeBob. New SpongeBob. I don't blame SB. I blame FUCKING PAUL TIBBIT!!!!  SCREW YOU PAUL!!!!
Thanks to that man-hag SpongeBob is completely f++ked up. 

Now, all Nick Studios cares about is money! And i Mean ONLY MONEY!!! They can do an episode where SpongeBob fucking laughs like a fucking pedophile for 20 minutes straight and NOT CARE AT ALL!!! All these people give a tinker's damn about is money, ratings, and fucking fame and fortune. These guys are like celebrities in disgize! They try hard yet put so little effort into their shows JUST to make a quick damned buck! The new episodes drive me nuts! Like Paul Tibbit even HAS any!!!> If I ever meet Paul in real life I swear to neptune I will cut off his large, hairy ball sack tare out his skull and feast on his insides for Thanksgiving!!!!

Nick's people these days are obviously on tons of marijuana! These drunk dunces have no idea in hell what cartoon quality is ALL ABOUT! It would've been WAY better if they just slaughtered this crappy series after the movie!!!! Why watch this shit anymore when Paul Tibbit DESTROYED SPONGEBOB!!!!!! Little do I understand the appeal of the new SpongeBob. I can't believe Paul Tibbit can actually get away with screwing around with a phenominal TV show like he's on freaking cocaine or something! P. Tibbit should be on trial and should get the death penalty is he's considered guilty. Sure there may be some people out there who like the new SpongeBob, but anyone that does may never understand the meaning of good quality. In conclusion, FUCK YOU PAUL TIBBIT!!! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!! 71.64.6.46",1
"A classic BWilkins block, with all the familiar traits to experienced observers - brevity, arrogance and ultimately, ineffectiveness. In true BWilkins style though, someone else has to take his nonsense blocks to their inevitable conclusion . So take your bow Reaper Eternal, there's a good lad.

So here goes, BWilkins presumably blocked me because he thought I was about to OUT someone, yet in his incompetence failed to lock this page, so.....drum roll......User:Mo ainm used to be User:BigDunc, the account that 'retired' and never went back to editting the same articles, pulling the same stunts, or so the public record would have you believe.

Yes, that's the super secret information that the esteemed *arbitrator* Elen of the Roads thinks should be permanently stricken from the record, even though he's now the very conspicuous last man standing of a clique of Irish Republican editors who have been skewing Wikipedia articles for YEARS using the same despicable tactics, and are only now starting to be noticed by the sloths who work AE and be dealt with as appropriate (or 'retire' as they see the wriitng on the wall for their hard won 'reputations' as editors in 'good standing' who never got noticed by the dumbshits who are supposed to monitor editors for compliance with all policies, not just the easy ones).

Mo survives due in no small part to the fact that none of his mates ever had the good fortune of getting away with a mid-life secret change of identity, as well as the general cowardice of people like BWilkins, who usually run a mile rather than deal with something complex like GAMEing on Irish republican related articles. Nope, that's far too much like work for that lazy prick.

This change of identity is being covered up by Elen on the grounds of OUTing. Yes, that's right, Elen wants to stake her reputation on a patently ridiculous claim that knowing that Mo ainm is really a bloke called Duncan who lives in Ireland, is a violation of WP:OUTING, just to cover up the fact that she never bothered to verify whether this was 100% grade A bullshit before she started blocking people for calling it as such, those who were there at the beginning and know just exactly how this lucky cunt came to have this excuse land in his lap and save him from a complete FAIL in understanding what is and is not a CLEANSTART.

So here we are, with sponge brained morons like Reaper and detestible assholes like BWilkins continuing the farce with blocks and censures like this. So well done guys. Assuming neither of you has the backbone to do the necessary and end this farce once and for all by calling Elen out on her lies, one of you has to now ensure this post gets oversighted so she can continue this OUTing bullshit story of hers to cover her own incompetent deceitful ass. (ab)use of oversight is logged, so it's at least good to have more names added to the list of people who've enabled this bullshit for so long anyway, it was starting to look like a one woman crusade.

 False inormation in the article 
As you would expect, the propagandists would say and do everything to mislead us. They once again proved themselfs to be the proven LIARS we alreayd knew they were since the article wrongly states that the darker picture with the """"fall-off"""" effects is the edited one, which is pure BS.

The original photo is the one with the """"fall-off"""" effect which was printed in The West Australian already back in august 2, 1969 (~6 min in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMuTiziCszU) while the lighten up picture is the EDITED version who came out much later. So unless the propaganda trolls cant find a version of THEIR claimed original version dated EARLIER than august second 1969, i suggest them to SHUTUP.

Youtube is not a reliable source for information about a conspiracy theory. Is there a reliable source available that supports your claim?   

 The Buzz Alrdin photo is explained at Examination_of_Apollo_Moon_photographs#Issues with crosshairs in photos.   You talkin' to me? 

The video shows a guy holding up the actual newspaper from 2 aug 1969 to prove that the """"fall-off"""" picture is how the original one looked like, but then its youtube who isnt a reliable source!?  your desperate try for making a point is laughable... but i wouldnt expect more from a propaganda TROLL.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 91.145.38.53   

 No, that newspaper doesn't show what the original one looks like.  The original is a transparency that is in NASA's vaults.  They made prints that were widely reprinted. See this for more information.  You talkin' to me? 

Bullshit! excuses from NASA wont make it true! you have the history of that picture in the video i linked to and even the NASA site you linked to shows the fact that the darker picture is the first one, the original from 1969, while the more lighten edited version came out 1975. So why you arguing? you dont have a chance here. As i said, BRING UP a picture dated earlier than 2 aug 1969 or SHUTUP - its that simple!

91.145.38.53, please stop insulting other editors and please sign your posts, just put four tildes at the end .   

I dont tolerating having my talk session closed, this is what the propagandists do? censoring their opponents!
Unless the propagandists cant bring up the picture THEY claim to be the original together with a date which needs to be earlier than second of august 1969, i will change the article. False misleading information should never be tolerated! Its already proven that the """"fall-off"""" darker version IS the original. If anyone wants to argue, then bring up! 91.145.38.53  

 The propaganda liars 
This article is beyond laughable! Since the propagandists trash talking and like to """"debunk"""" ppl like Bart Sibrel, Ralph Rene, and Bill Kaysing (with no evidence to debunk them, however) we should debunk the LIARS the propagandists listen to!  """"youtube is not a reliable source"""" the propagandists says... still they link to youtube videos themselfs to suit their false propaganda in a desperate act to try prove THEIR laughable points. So if they can link to youtube videos, i will do the same just to prove that THEIR sources are nothing else than FALSE PROPAGANDA.

It isn't...which reflects the ongoing, glaring weakness of Wikipedia in general: factual accuracy plays second fiddle to concerted efforts to rewrite history by collective entities.  This 'Lebanon War' Wiki entry is a classic example of this.  Israel clearly lost this campaign, but you can read the entire article and really not know who won.  

...what a disservice Wikipedia is.  It is almost pernicious, as this medium is so easily hijacked by special interests who pervert the truth to serve their own special interests.

Cash I am a walmart assocate and I do feel there is a link between Walmart managment and servant leadership, and here is why. The managers are not in charge of the store, the hourly associates are, they take orders directly from the customers. The customers are consitered under walmarts policies to be the boss, the hourly assocates are next in that order and so on. This is a backwards model that was set fourth by Sam Walton himself and is maintained by the current board. Grassroots survays are conducted every 3mos to a year, this survey is a rating of each manager, and is then reviewed by the district and Regional VP, then changes are made. Each level of management must answer to the hourly assocates, and so it is kinda a push/pull managment system. Take my own situation for an example. heres what happend, one night I am short of assocates in the deli(which is where I work) Temp logs did not get done, of course this is a major mistake, I was """"written up"""" for this. However I did not feel this was fair, so I wrote an email to our district manager explaining the situation, he then forwarded the matter to our regional VP. Our VP came to our store, flew in from bentonville mind you. To deal with the situation, he met with me for about an hour and also met with some other deli assocates. After a week he calls me and tells me that he can not get rid of the Written warning, however that all of the managers that had been informed that we where short, would be on probation for the next six months. I was satisfied with the outcome Because, While I was not fault free in the situation, management however was informed that I did not have enough people to help customers and deal with the food safty logs, and they failed to act accordingly and I was not happy with it, so in the end I punished them for their poor perfomance. So you can kinda see why they consiter it a servant leadership. 

Also Cash I hate the way you term 'vast left-wing conspiracy' I am myself a liberal and we liberals are not part of that conspiracy ideal, that would be your union leaders and right-wing large business owners, that are anti-walmart, As much as you would like to identify us liberals with the unions we are in no way assocated with them, infact most of us liberals dislike the unions just as much if not more then you right-wingers. Because the general public tends to identify unions with the democratic party and this is because most union voters, vote on the liberal side, this does not mean that they are liberals, just that they play the politics game. True liberals hate the unions and feel that they are just as bad or worse then a currupt big business. With a currupt big business atleast you know what they are and they make no bones about it, with a union they want to be your friend and then screw you. lol.

On the part about this entry being POV it is very much so POV however I have given up tring to balance it out myself the Anti-Walmart people always revert your edit and then threaten to get you banned for the three revert rule when you attempt to make any edits, its a freaking joke the way they act.

Wait.  You're not going to block me for posting an RFC?

Or did you block me just so that I couldn't go advertising the RFC on other pages where it might be relevant?

See.  There's the problem. As a non-admin, I am liable to be blackballed by admins, some of whom suffer from Projection (or do they merely think sophistry is administration?):

I performed no personal attacks.  I made analogies between admin behavior and classical abuse of power.
I was personally attacked. No admins have been blocked.

I was not trolling.  Calling me a troll is nothing but a lie designed to anger me and cause me to overreact.  It's an attempt to fabricate """"evidence"""" for a block.
At least one admin thinks my being called a troll is enough evidence, because now I am blocked. (And I seriously doubt any admin is reading this page).

I was not disrupting anything and I am not posting in any inappropriate manner.  I was discussing the problem in the forum provided.  Blocking people to stop them from winning an argument is the disruption.

There are 1,7000 admins on this thing.  I have no illusion that all 1,700 of them will be right all the time.  The first 20 who saw Chooserr's postings may have said """"okay by me"""".  It's the first one who comes along who misreads the situation who causes the problem.  One mistaken admin invalidates the opinions of 20 rational ones.  Meanwhile, a well-meaning user is punished for doing nothing wrong, demonized in the community, and the community is thrown into dysfunction.  To the point that anyone coming to their defense is treated with an egregious level of imperiousness, intimidation, sophistry, and dismissive attitude, followed by an abuse of power.

Do not block me.  Block Curps for failing to perform due diligence before injuring a user.  Block Zoe and Mysekurity for validating and amplifying Curps' error rather than taking a skeptical attitude.  Block Nandesuka for repeating the error and then attacking me for defending the oppressed individual.  And block Sean Black for either deliberately or gormlessly falling for their false accusations against me.

The behavior of the admins in this event is a classic abuse of power: a clique of bullies hiding their damage by increasing it.  """,1

Fact, Obama made a deal with his Muslim pals in the Muslim Brotherhood to let them kidnap Stevens so that he would be forced to trade him for the Blind Sheikh but Stevens was raped and killed instead. That is why Obama would rather have all America know that he is a incompetent scumbag then  know the truth.  OK go ahead and delete this truth since Wakopedia is all about lies and coverup.

Excellent and accomplished example of a bureaucratic fuck, Tony spends hours lurking on IRC under his favorite nick of Sherilyn Sideway to have cyber sex with unsuspecting guys.

On wikipedia there was a fake aspie and Tony Sidaway banned him.  Tony gives his reasons for banning: 
 """"I have blocked this editor becausae he's stupid"""" (spelling error preserved) 
 """"he's an obvious nutter ...  Let's just tell him to fuck off."""" 
 """"He's a troll. Our only appropriate words to him are """"fuck off.""""

Routinely, other bureaucratic fucks on wikipedia have blocked Tony. (log of blocks)

He also blocks others for reasons like """"Idiot"""", """"Particularly stupid troll"""" and an admin for """"Persistently flaunting a stupidly large signature with multiple image inclusions.""""

He also harasses banned users by reverting anything they write on their talk pages and protecting it simply by saying, """"they attempted to use their talk page.""""   Note: other wikipedia admins do this abuse, too.

He bans anyone who says the slightest thing even vaguely related to criticizing something even vaguely related to an admin.  He also hides what they say (example).

 Adult-child sex & child sexual abuse 

Copied from WP:ANI ohio 

 I've asked this question before, but I've never had an understandable explanation:  How is the article a POV fork?  If it's been explained previously, just point me to the diff.  I've seen plenty of people say it's a POV fork, but what I see is a value-neutral etic approach to a topic that's as old as humanity itself.  Even if the title is POV, the content can be used in other articles, so why delete it? ohio 

 """"Adult-child sex"""" is a euphemism (for child sexual abuse), and any article titled """"Adult-child sex"""" is prima facie assumed to be apologistic for child sexual abuse. Exactly as if someone took an article """"Nazi genocide"""" and retitled (or made a fork) entitled """"Nazi demographic adjustments"""". We understand that you don't agree with this but if you still don't understand it then you had better look to yourself.   

 Exactly as Hero said. As a contemporary example, Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide. One is just a fancy name for the other.  •   •  • 03:41 (UTC)  6 Mar '08

I don't see the logic of that.  Adult-child sex (the term) goes no further than plain description.  I can see where some editors were trying to insert POV material about child sexual abuse into the article, but I don't see how it logically follows that the term itself becomes a euphemism for child sexual abuse.  The term itself can advance no agenda.  It is materially different from the genocide = demographic adjustments example, which may invoke Godwin's law.  As for VP's example, ethnic cleansing means something different from (but related to) genocide, just as adult-child sex does with child sexual abuse.  The repeated assertion has been made that the term itself is POV.  Where is the POV in it?  Since this seems not to be much of an AN/I question, I invite replies at my talk page. ohio """,1

Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the """"tradecraft"""" used to collect this information.
Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says """"Hey Balls get ready for a patry"""" Balls replies """"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  

History
Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/

The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.

Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU
 ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. 

Various Forms
Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.

The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web

"THIS ARTICLE SHOULD BE DELETED!!! 

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page. 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own... HELL, why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves. Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing (accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody), but hasn't done anything to deserve any special credit. Apart from his compositions which truly aren't anything brilliant - in fact, they're almost bland and boring (from a compositional point of view), he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant (which seems to be the deluded, sick, biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube) when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal, completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music. 

Now this deluded, sick individual on YouTube (MikeCaffey) seems to go about praising Dick (short for Richard, and far more funny to refer him to that, than Richard) for his compositions, deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike, possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others. As a pianist myself, I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to piano-god, and even if it did Dick STILL wouldn't be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal, completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves. 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent. Although they may not care whether they have a page or not, I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own. 

Hey - I can play Hungarian Rhapsody... can I have a page???",1

"""This is ridiculous. """"It makes Iranians look stupid""""...? Who the fuck are you? A political commentator? An outspoken, self-proclaimed expert on contemporary Iranian politics? Oh right, my pen-name is The Persian Cataphract, so let me try to decipher your next tactical move. The race card? Oh right, your name's not Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson. Let me guess the next one. Nationalist. That's right, you'll throw each and every syllable of content present in my message, in favour of this preconceived straw-man, fallacy and red herring. You'll probably even point to my liberal use of profanity. I just must be nothing else than this lion-and-sun foam-at-mouth Persian nationalist with an inferiority complex spiced with a pinch of victim mentality. And certainly I must be dumb, as you so eloquently have arbitrated above.

You said it yourself, right here:

...I am used to being attacked by editors whose very account names show they are here for single-topic pov-pushing. Who do you expect to be neutral on topics of Iranian nationalism? A user called """"IranianGuy"""", or a Swiss editor contributing under his real name and no stakes in the matter? Who, for that matter, do you expect to be neutral on topics of Armenian nationalism, an editor called """"AraratArev"""" (vel sim.)...

Is that how you assess content? By making a shallow assumption on pen-names? Expectations? The God-given right to anonymity on the Internet? How fucking petty are you and the idiot who made you an administrator? What next, are you going to ban Iranians from editing or contributing to Iran-related articles? Indeed not just a laughable policy, but indeed a dangerous one as well. Most of the world-class authorities are Iranians. With your fucked up logic, we should dismiss their contributions because irrespective of their content, you'll instead look at their political affiliations and their names and put it into the bin of rejection. Oh right, you're Swiss and because Switzerland is this shining paragon of neutrality hosting thousands of bank accounts of Islamic terror organization, you're obviously this stereotypical neutralist... Good lord, listen to yourself. 

Luckily academia doesn't work like that. Scholarly enterprise and political affiliations remain strictly separated. So it doesn't really matter if Kaveh Farrokh or anyone else is a self-declared outspoken Nazi, Communist, Socialist, Liberal, Conservative or what have you, it has no bearing on content that must be assessed purely by content. That's NPOV. A sober, neutral, objective approach, just bare-bones, bare-knuckles source critique. Source. Critique. Make an assessment on the content, not the person(s). You marginalized IranianGuy. Period. And as conveniently as you shrugged him off because of his pen-name, you shrugged off his fully legitimate criticism of your approach. No matter what country or pen-name or real name you have, it has a universal stamp: Asshole behaviour.

Well, sure, but that's weak""""35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't"""". Come on. That's not serious.

But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased.

Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, """"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right."""" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.

ikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",1

This personage, it is stated, had two sons, Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu. From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson, and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson.

 Censorship 

Was Final Fantasy VII censored at all? I mean, the content wasn't as strong as, say, Final Fantasy VIII's, but I would imagine something was censored. Plus, it doesn't say anything about censorship on this page. Could someone please answer to this? 
Not that I recall. It certainly wasn't censored as much as the older games were.  
As I recall, some language was censored, some wasn't.  
The word """"bastard"""" appeared on various occasions, but """"fuck"""" and """"shit"""" were censored.  
< recet indent
Some words were censored, some were not, which ones seem arbitrary.
Only instance I could find of """"Fuck"""" uncensored:
Computer: Cid! We have an emergency situation! A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!
Cid: What!? Who is the little fuck!?
Computer: I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section.
Cid: Hey goddammit!! Who the #*$$#&'s still in there?
Earliest instance of """"Shit""""
Shinra Manager: I'm not give in to violence…and I'm not giving you my seat either!
Tifa: Barret!!
Barret: #^*$!! You lucky #$#*!
Cloud: So, what are we gonna do now?
Barret: Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm…
In total, """"Fuck"""" is said uncensored once, """"Shit"""" is said uncensored 12 times, """"ass"""" is said 15 times (sometimes occuring as Jackass), """"Damn"""" is said 68 times, and I couldn't find any occurances of """"Bastard"""".  Censored words appear approx. 33 times.  
My version must be different.  The """"fuck"""" is censored, and the comment with Barret the last editor quoted, the first word was uncensored(though it had an apostrophe stuck in the middle, making it """"shi't"""".  I noted a lot of uncensored """"ass"""" and """"shit"""" though, and after playing FFX and FFXII for so long, going back and playing FFVII, I was a little surprised by the language.  In fact, it's the only Fantasy RPG I've ever played with uncensored profanity.  But yes, it was at least partially censored. 
 Nevertheless, unless we get concrete primary sourcing from an interview or whatever, we can't include this in the article. — er 
Well, the box says it's rated teen for mild language and violence...  But I'm not sure of any primary sources that would even deal with this particular issue.. 
Beyond a mention that there is some uncensored language I really don't think this type of info belongs in an encyclopedia.  And even the slight mention is iffy to me.   
Well, it's the first Final Fantasy to come to America with any uncensored language.  But then again, all the Final Fantasies to come to America in that period of time had to go through Nintendo of America's censorship guidelines of the time. 
It might be worth noting (at least in the discussion) that the computer version was far more censored than the PSX version. Almost every instance of """"shit"""" was removed, consistently with #^$& or similar characters. Also, certain important lines had their translations changed. """"Back then, you could get by with only skinned knees"""", for example, was changed to something likely more grammatically correct, but weird to a long time player of the PSX version.  

I have the PC version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form Barret. They were all situations of anger though so it didn't impact the storyline much.

Actually there was some sexual censorship if I recall. """"Slightly stretched underwear"""" was changed to """"Therapeutic underwear."""" Not sure why it's better, but I'm pretty sure they did it because they thought """"slightly stretched"""" was sexually inappropriate. (The item is found in Tifa's dresser drawer during the nibelhiem flashback sequence.)

Hey Koreans, who the fuck do you think you're dealing with. Guess what, Gaogouli was a Chinese vassal you stupid fucks. After the fall of the Tang Dynasty, close to 700,000 were incorporated into Tang history, a little less than half migrated to the Central Plains, 100,000 to the Chinese state of Bohai and only 100,000 into Xinluo (Silla). Most Gaogouli descendants are Chinese.

With the sole exception of Ansi fort itself, Tang troops destroyed Gaogouli soldiers on the battlefield, despite being a significantly smaller force. If anything, Gaogouli only DEFENDED itself from assaults from Sui and Tang. Gaogouli was a mere Chinese vassal, nothing more. The greatest threat came from the TuBo, TuJue and HuiHe from the west. Koreans are a bunch of fucking attention whores.

You fucking barbarian kimchi gooks have a lot of nerve to badmouth your former masters, considering the fact that you were our little dog for most of your existance.

Obviously, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia only people with proprietary interest in an article can edit. You're part of the problem. Underwood had an effect on the church, or at bare minimum is an 'in-joke' therefore there should be mention of him in the article. I can see your mind is made up though, so I'll save my breath, there's no point having integrity when surrounded by folks determined to enforce their bias and other folks too busy to research the subject properly (it took you several minutes to research hundreds of posts and relationships between church members and Underwood). I'm done. Your arrogance is plain as day. I didn't claim to have made a perfect edit, I even suggested re-editing in the talk page. However Underwood's effect is plain as day, and as such should be mentioned. The reason I'm leery of the 'custodians' of the page is because in adding the Bob Black bombing I encountered the same kind of opposition. I'm not opposed to the Church, I just think that articles deserve more than custodial opinions by caretaker editors who have a vested interest in the outcome of the article. You were just in too big a hurry. I have a fair amount of experience editing, and know that a mention shouldn't require a full-on assault to accomplish when there is proof of association. I'm not trying to make the Church look guilty, just trying to keep accuracy on a topic that (if you research the Underwood article) often has been edited less than veraciously and is a continuously recurring discussion topic in alt.slack even 5 years after the murders.

...It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of magazine covers: to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question,...

The images are being used to illustrate programmes, not the TVTimes magazine. Therefore I'd say they're not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia's fair-use copyrights policy.

Additionally, the tag says ...To the uploader: please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use, as described on Wikipedia:Image description page, as well as the source of the work and copyright information. These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don't provide the source of the work (scan, taken from another website etc).

Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link

Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warming's alleged impact on hurricanes.

“The [computer] models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us,"""" said Emanuel, whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear.

He told the New York Times. """"There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing. Hard to know which to believe yet.”

In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming.

His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.

""""First, 2007 turned out to be the ‘tipping point’ for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears.

“Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of man-made climate fears.”

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

I would like to leave a message at this user User:Stwalkerster's talk page but I cannot, because for some reason those are blocked to, so I have to do it this way instead.  Hopefully he has the notifications turned on (tags of username).  I can be calm and work with other people.  This is noted in my first reply, where it gives several examples of how users should have had discussion instead of attacking and reverting me and arguing hostilely on my talk page.  Users who wish to work with me should not make attacks, write words like """"compliance"""", revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead (details of referred-to edits in a separate paragraph below, make false claims against me, or delete my replies on discussion pages (not talk pages) and then ARCHIVE it after removing them!!  (Users should not do these kinds of things to anyone.)  What this means is that if users act in a reasonable manner, then a normal discussion can ensue (including from myself).  Merely because someone has used a template, written a shorter reply, or wrote their aggressive, confrontational remarks in a business-style manner, does not mean that they are """"being reasonable"""" or """"writing nicely"""".  When someone makes a falsified report about you or writes a falsified comment, etc., it is not reasonable to expect the victim to reply without mentioning this, or to want to """"be friends"""" with the attacker.  If the other people are being reasonable then of COURSE I am going to reply to them in a different way.  Editing an article by...(below) is not reasonable, nor is """"ganging up"""" (the discussion page), nor is replying in several places at once, etc.  How can replying to other users stating bad and/or false things about you be """"confrontational""""?  I have mentioned several times about having an actual discussion but no one did this and instead just kept replying on my talk pages.  The fact that I mentioned having a discussion indicates that I think reasonable discussion is the right or reasonable way to do it.  Just no one wanted to do anything but attack me so I did not have another way.

The headlines are not """"veiled"""", they are in plain light.  It was not any attempt to be """"hidden"""".  For headline #5, I literally do or did not know of a different way to title this headline which is not an attack on myself.  For headline #8, it is truthful and the falsification was blatant by Ebyabe, and I actually expected her to edit it to something on her next message.  I mean she directly mentions it; edit summary says a reason but her message says differently (directly, not implied).  For this headline, it is not a """"personal attack"""" because it is true and evident: Administrator complains about my signature even though signature has been changed, and messages by me since posted, before the block happened, as well as direct linking to comments which contain no personal attacks as a reason for """"personal attacks"""".  If the titles were UNTRUE they would be attacks, but since they are true unambiguously then they can't be attacks. The last headline yes, somewhat motivated/hostile, because he is the one put an useless headline so that there's TWO AT ONCE, *AFTER* my notice is up, while also writing the things that show the actual tyranny (a word used in this case solely because it is already being talked about, and not meant as any attack/instigation/hostile/etc.). Although the link by Jamie appears to say something about political opinions, if someone is making false claims then it is appropriate for them to be exposed.

So as you can see my intents are to be reasonable and normal (with the 'possible' exception of this particular headline), and repeatedly asking other people to do this, but being annoyed by all their attacks and false remarks as well.

Edits (in a separate paragraph so that reading it is optional): """"Users working with me should not...revert edits when they could have further fixed the edit instead"""" - Instead of reverting multiple times, attacking, and then harassing, the use",1

Picture this: Wikipedia user_A in China posts material that does not support the current government. User_B is also in China and privately messages user_A that they will report them to the authorities. (as they are required by law to do). Wikipedia would obviously not allow user_B to continue to help suppress the freedom of speech of User_A, especially since the Law of China has no authority over Wikipedia, and neither does the law of the US armed forces.
You, Orangemarlin are overstepping your duty, you cling to your past authority like a baby clings to their blanket. You have no business threatening anyone for their actions on wikipedia.

I recently wrote a post on my Facebook account based on what I wrote to a deletionist who deleted Olamot Con because a different deletionist marked it for speedy deletion, before I had a chance to work on it further and address their concerns. Here is the link - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FreeRangeFrog#A_BIG_FUCK_YOU_TO_YOU.2C_SCUM_OF_THE_EARTH.21.21.21_YOU_ARE_NOT_A_GENTLEMAN.21.21.21 . Wikipedia deletionists like him are poisoning the wells of everyone and demotivate people considerably. You should speak against them NOW!!!",1

We can all tailor hypotheticals to fit our arguments, but they are irrelevant, practical application is the real test.

1. Inline citations are not required by policy

No policy requires inline citations. They are often a good idea, and are a requirement for feature article status, but it is not a requirement for all articles. Furthermore, the tag is often used when the article has adequate sources. This tag therefore enshrines a particular editor's view about style (that the article in question should have inline citations) in an inappropriate way. That point belongs on the talk page, not in the article itself. Robert A.West (Talk) 

    Where does it say that featured articles have different requirements then other articles? Jeepday 

        The whole point in to get citations for all articles so that they meet the WP:V requirements, I have noticed that tags quite often help by bringing this to attention of users, particularly new-ish users. Cheers SeanMack 

            I agree with Jeepday and SeanMack. Our ultimate goal should be for every article to be of FA quality.  Satori Son 

                That goal is not consensus among editors. But more importantly, inline citations for every fact are not an FA requirement; see WP:FA? section 1c. CMummert · talk

Hey asshole.

Stop putting in the redundant phrase """"a claim unsupported by other modern or ancient sources"""", shitface. The Encyclopedia Iranica does indeed find support in the ancient sources (considering how many troops Ariobarzanes brought with himself to the battle of Gaugamela, and the nature of the location of the battle of the Persian Gates which could IMPOSSIBLY house any of the estimates given by Hammond or Waldemar Heckel) The Greek numbers given are obviously inflated and have no root in historical reality. How can Ariobarzanes magically summon more troops than Darius III Codomannus at Ecbatana (where the greater part of the nobility followed him)? Explain that to me, cuntface.

So stop being a shithead, pretty please? I will not relent in removing that phrase. It is stupid on so many levels and serves only as an attempt to discredit the Encyclopedia Iranica, when in fact it does a better job at cutting down customarily inflated Greek estimates than Hammond who takes his numbers straight from the Imperial Roman author Curtius-Rufus (Which was a thinly veiled political exaltation of emperor Vespasian).

Islam does intrinsically promote religious fanaticism, does promote violence and ill-feeling towards non-Muslims, does seem to spawn many terrorists, and is intrinsically hostile to concepts such as equality, tolerance, democracy and human rights.

"Amandajm: Ignorant Muslim & Disgusting Anti-white Racist
Reading back on racist, Amandajm - I've come to realize that in addition to his muslim name, he veritably hates white people. He deletes info about european history even if such info is based upon accurate inferences. Why he does this should be the subject of debate. My theory is that he's jealous of white culture and history being that he's muslim. Also, it's important to note that muslims of his poor ilk who exhibit such hatred additionally exude homosexual frustrations. This is well documented in psychiatric circles. Why a dirty, white-hating muslim should possess the reponsibility of writing an article on a culture and history not his own is WAY beyond me. If he wants to write about muslim history, he should. But, he shouldn't be given the chance to write about something he obviously knows nothing about and DOES NOT pertain to him. This guy IS NOT european. Honestly, he doesn't deserve to be on wiki at all. 'Stay on your side of the fence', is a motto I always quote.

To that, yesterday I followed up by sending emails to Homeland Security and the FBI Counter-terrorism Division for investigation into who he is and what his motives are. (No, I've not gone off the deep end). I received an automatic response email from the FBI stating that they will look into the matter, and will definitley be following up. Racist muslims of this type are tricky and can pose a risk to the US. Also, I sent an email to wiki complaining about this enemy of europeans and americans.

 The various local government areas pages only list them.  I was thinking something like that.  These three paragraphs are from a couple of papers I wrote, they can be incorporated into the article.  

The states (and territories) run the majority of the government in Australia and devolve some of this power down to local government, local councils.  Because this devolution of power happens on a state by state basis, in different states, the local councils have different powers.  Though generally they provide water, sewerage and look after local roads, with the states looking after health, education, police and so on.

Tasmania, like the other states, has a constitution.  Unlike the Australian constitution the Tasmanian one is simply an act of parliament, as such to change it requires no more then a majority in the parliament, not a referendum.  This constitution (among other things) establishes local government in Part """"IVA - Local Government"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  However, this part while establishing the fact that councils will exist, leaves open how they are operated and what their powers are.  Both the system and power of the councils being provided by the """"Parliament ... from time to time"""" (Tasmanian Constitution).  It is the """"Local Government Act 1993"""" (referred hereafter to as either the 'LGA' or 'the act') that currently provides for the creation of the various councils, the role of the councillors, what power the councils have and so on.  

The act requires that the various councils """"provide for the health, safety and welfare of the community"""", """"represent and promote the interests of the community"""", and """"provide for the peace, order and good government of the municipal area"""".  Generally the act permits councils to """"do anything necessary or convenient to perform its functions either within or outside its municipal area"""".  Specifically, the act provides for the various councils to have the following powers (among others): to charge land rates, """"service rates"""", special rates and to levy fines (in relation to by-laws); and, to make by-laws in respect to anything the council has power to do.

 PLEASE READ BEFORE ADDING ANY MORE RUBBISH 

As far as I can see Wikipedia has become a very turgid shadow of what I originally signed up to - and I really can't see any point editing it any more.

Having followed the climate articles for many years and now having a great deal of expertise, I can no longer just sit back and hope that Wikipedia will some day come around to a NPOV. There are certain simple things that are so obviously POV pushing that it beggars belief that they still go on: 

Not using common names when they are used by everyone else
Not admitting simple facts like it is not currently warming.
Pretending """"global warming"""" is a """"scientific"""" issue when everyone knows it is mainly political rhetoric even when practised by the """"scientists"""".

And don't you dare think I'm pushing POV - I have not once added anything to a climate article without first seeking consensus (which basically means I have never edited a climate article)!!!!

I KNOW WHAT IS A NPOV ... BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED FROM WHEN I USED TO BE A GLOBAL WARMING ADVOCATE AND NEITHER HAVE MY VIEWS ON THE ENVIRONMENT CHANGED ... I JUST CAN'T STAND PEOPLE BEING DISHONEST, AND I JUST THINK SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS

From the day I first tried to get a NPOV on the climate articles (when I used to work in wind and was openly saying global warming is happening) till today, I haven't once managed to get a substantial change toward NPOV into a climate article. '''I'm angry ... not because I f*cking wanted to put the sceptical view ... it is because you bunch of pr***s have turned me into a sceptic because you refuse to see the obvious POV pushing that has been going on.

And the great consolation, is that the climate articles have been so POV that most decent people can spot it a mile off and what with climategate, the propaganda in Wikipedia is no longer considered a reliable source.   """,1

The homepage of the Anarchist Internatonal, www.anarchy.no , is not nonsensensial. Try to prove it and you will fail. The article Anarchist International on Wikipedia is objective and to the point. 

The organizations/networks associated to the Anarchist International are found at the link-page of www.anarchy.no , and then there is a big network of networkmembers/subscribers related to the different organizations/networks.

As for Zazaban I have problems with taking him seriously. In a discussion on Anarchism.net he answered with the following """"intelligent"""" and a bit ochlarchical statements:

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.

Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!  Dodo (and many others) amount to semi-professional BUSYBODIES who strut their stuff by interfering with others' use of WP.  Stop it.

This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".

Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""

Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""

Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.

I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis.

 Look you moron, if the 1000 series is T-1000? Then guess what's the 800 series is? MORON! IDIOT! And as stated here, in one of the discussion in this page:
I agree with Christopher Thomas, below, regarding unclarified sources for this article.  Specifically, I take issue with the entire """"Differences between the 800 and 850 series"""" section, because I contend that there is no such thing as a """"T-850"""".  Stan Winston Studios, which designed the terminators for the films, confirmed this to me via e-mail when I wrote to them asking their opinion.  Their response (direct quote): """"I'm not sure where the T-850 came from.  As far as I know, Arnold's Terminator has and always will be the T-800, model 101.  Now, the robot Terminators in T3 are T1's and Kristana Loken is the TX.  I hope that clears it up...""""  While the term """"T-850"""" is somewhat widespread on the internet, even extending to T3-related merchandise such as action figures, its origin is, to my mind, something of a mystery.  Rich 
 Stan Winston DESIGNED the Terminator, and he says it's T-800! Now shut the fuck up and change it back you idiot!""",1

"""

The user's final edit was to blank his Talk page with the edit summary """"fuck it.""""  The page blanking was reverted """"because of an active block"""".  The block is no longer active, the user has not returned to Wikipedia, and I think it is pretty clear that """"fuck it"""" is the equivalent of """"I am retiring from Wikipedia.""""  It seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they don't want to come back to Wikipedia and that they don't want their sad saga displayed on their Talk page for all eternity, that is within their rights.
Also, I question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy.  Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm?  While WP:DRC is merely a guideline, there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page.  I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find.  (If I am wrong, please enlighten me!)
If I have to abide by rules I think are dumb, then so does everybody else.  In fact, that is the difference between us and Karaku  Karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant.  I disagree with the rules, but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place.  And by my interpretation of the current rules, Karaku's blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted.  
Furthermore, while I recognize that I was using the word """"VANISH"""" imprecisely, it appears to be a longstanding tradition in Wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing, they have the right to do that.  Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that (is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying """"Retired"""" at the top of your Talk page vs. blanking the thing with the edit summary """"fuck it""""?).
Anyway, I'm obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired user's talk page.  I'm just sort of surprised at the insistence to leave all this stuff in place when the user doesn't want it and Wikipedia policy provides no mechanism to override those wishes...   """,1

"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",1

Redvers, I noticed that in the discussion regarding Youknowbest on the noticeboard, you used some pretty strong language that I think it somewhat inappropriate. Was it your intention to use words like that? Shirulashem (talk) 

Which words do you object to? ➨ ❝ЯEDVERS❞ a sweet and tender hooligan  
The 7th word in your third sentence in the discussion, beginning """"As an Athiest ..."""" Shirulashem (talk)  
Do you mean """"fuck""""? Yes, I did intend to use the word in that position in that sentence, specifically in the formation """"fuck all"""", meaning """"less than nothing"""". Hope this helps. ➨ ❝ЯEDVERS❞ a sweet and tender hooligan  
I was quite surprised to see an admin using such language. Is there a culture where that's acceptable? Maybe I'm missing something. Shirulashem (talk)

I have a few questions for you that you might want to give some thought to before you nominate yourself as an admin.

(1) Do you feel your love of licking balls would help you or hurt you as an administrator?

(2) Would you be willing to accept an award for Wikipedia's Biggest Crybaby for running to WP:ANI, WP:RFCU, and WP:AIV every two minutes with every trivial complaint?

(3) As Gwen Gale's official man servant, would you create articles about yourself and your terrible novel just like your master did?

HELLO DORK 
Hello dork, I consider you an intellectual coward and a fraud.  You are truly a little man, with morals and values, that waver like a wet noddle.  You may have some education, but your grammar and construct is not much better then mine, dork.   Your mind is polluted and and you have no morality, except your own variable values and this is what really frightens me.  You believe in ends justified the means and you have no limits unless it your way.  this is what is shown, time and time again on your behavior on wikipeidia. BTW, Your a real joke on WR.  Finely, the Sockspuppet thing on wiki, is a screaming joke.  IPs are now dynamic and I have access to millions of them.  I can write, make accounts, at will and have a drawer full of socks (in wikispeak).  You are a pathetic little cultist, with out your own mind or morality.  PS. to the wiki admins, I consider you to be scum due to the enabling the bullshit that soaks wikipeida and the perversion of the idea of """"encyclopedic"""" to online role playing game, with out accountability to any reasonable athority. 76.203.19.83  """,1

While at Harvard College 19-year-old Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly used login data from his social network to hack into fellow students email accounts; that evidence also included instant message transcripts where he calls facebook users """"dumb fucks"""". The alleged following exchange is between a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg and a friend shortly after Mark launched The Facebook in his dorm room:
 
Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard

Zuck: Just ask.

Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS

[Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one?

Zuck: People just submitted it.

Zuck: I don't know why.

Zuck: They """"trust me""""

Zuck: Dumb fucks.

FRIEND: so have you decided what you are going to do about the websites?

ZUCK: yea i’m going to fuck them

ZUCK: probably in the year
